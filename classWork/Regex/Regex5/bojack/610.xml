   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:06" sub="{\an8}"/>The idea behind the Japanese art of kintsugi </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:09" sub="{\an8}"/>is that cracks in an object are part of its
    history. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:12" sub="{\an8}"/>-What does that have to do with anything? -We have

   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:54"/> Sure. I think it would help if you figured out why you need to
    put a number on your body, and let me get back to this mystery. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:59"/> Thanks. </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:09"/> "Birthday Dad" premiered last night to a 0.006, which is the

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:18"/> Great! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:19"/> Meanwhile, my company's running like gangbusters. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:22"/> Is gangbusters a slur of some sort? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:23"/> -Can we still say gangbusters? -I'll look into it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:25"/> And with Todd watching the baby, my work-life balance is on
    point. </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:07:32"/> What would make my work-life balance even on pointier? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:35"/> And it hit me: more work! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:37"/> So, I thought I'd check in and see how your book's doing. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:39"/> Oh. I'm still kind of figuring out what the "is" of it is, you
    know? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:44"/> -It's been six months. -Okay, I think it's about... </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:07:48"/> -Trauma. <i>-Trauma?</i>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:50"/> Or... damage. </line>

    filled with gold and then they're even more beautiful? </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:07:55"/> Maybe it's like that, you know? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:57"/> Like, we've all been damaged, but it's good damage because it
    makes us more who we are. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:01"/> Is that anything? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:02"/> Yeah, good damage. I like it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:05"/> Send me the pages and we'll get 'em to the publisher. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:07"/> Okay, but no hurry? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:08"/> Okay, but, no. Hurry. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:14"/> What can I get ya? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:14"/> Some information with a side order of revelation. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:17"/> Is that a type of pasta? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:18"/> Oh, also a water. I am parched. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:21"/> In fact, why don't you freeze that water into a cube shape and
    drop it in some bourbon. </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:38"/> But you have seen them? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:40"/> I'm gonna go ask the kitchen about your pasta. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:43"/> BoJack? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:45"/> Wait, that's the fellow from the police report, who found the

    <timestamp data-time="00:08:52"/> If he was also with her at the AA meeting... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:54"/> Well, then why wouldn't he mention it to the police? What's he
    hiding? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:56"/> You're starting to make more sense than a change machine. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:58"/> Yeah, speaking of cents, what happened to Penny? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:02"/> -Oh, poop! Our scoop's flown the coop! -Go, go, go! Gotta stay

    distracted. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:22"/> It's because of the meds. This is what I was afraid would
    happen. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:24"/> But isn't it worth it? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:25"/> You've been feeling so much better, right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:27"/> I do feel lighter, and clearer, but also so foggy. </line>
   <line>
