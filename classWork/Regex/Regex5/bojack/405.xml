   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:17"/> Sorry to interrupt your lunch, but there was another mass
    shooting. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:21"/> Oh, God, where? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:22"/> A town outside Tampa called-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:24"/> Not geographically, dipshit. What's the location? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:27"/> What is it, a pharmacy? A haberdashery? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:29"/> -It was a shopping mall. -No! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:34"/> -<i>Ms. Taken</i> is coming out next month. -I know, sir. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:37"/> The whole third act revolves around Courtney Portnoy shooting
    people in a mall. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:40"/> What are we supposed to do now, not release the movie? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:43"/> I hope it doesn't come to that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:45"/> I am sick and tired of real-life gun violence getting in the
    way of us telling stories that glamorize gun violence. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:50"/> Why does this keep happening? Has the whole world gone crazy? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:54"/> No, we've just been conditioned by a rugged individualist
    culture woven into the savage architecture of our country itself, birthed as it was through
    violent uprising, but perhaps popularized in the modern imagination by stories of-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:05"/> Okay, Chomsky, when I want you to talk, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:07"/> I'll staple a string to your back and then yank it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:09"/> Why not make yourself useful and schedule a sit-down with
    Courtney Portnoy's team to talk about how we distance ourselves from this <i>fakakte
     mishegoss.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:15"/> Got it. Except for the foccacia<i> </i>Michigan part. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:18"/> {\an8}<i>Excuse me, could you point me</i>
    <i>in the direction of an H&amp;M?</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:22"/> {\an8}<i>Sure. But when you get there,</i>
    <i>you're gonna be DOA.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:26"/> {\an8}<i>Uh-uh. You picked the wrong shopaholic</i>
    <i>to mess with.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:29"/> {\an8}<i>Because this shopaholic's</i>
    <i>also a holic for revenge.</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:45"/> -I lied! -What? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:46"/> There's no Carla Mercedes Benzbrown. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:48"/> -I have no idea who your mother is. -What? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:50"/> I don't want to have a relationship lying to each other. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:52"/> Okay, so why did you lie to me? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:54"/> I meant everything else I said. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:55"/> I'll do everything I can to help find your mom. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:57"/> To be honest, moms aren't all that great. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:00"/> {\an8}In fact, in my experience, they're soulless succubi </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:02"/> {\an8}born fully formed from the ass of Satan. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:03"/> Oh, my grandmother sounds like quite a character. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:06"/> {\an8}-Can I meet her? -Oh, my mom? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:07"/> {\an8}No, you cannot meet my mom because she's... dead. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:11"/> -Oh. -Dead mom. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:15"/> {\an8}BoJack, what happened to the fudgesicles I bought? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:18"/> -I lied again. My mom's not dead. -Stop lying to me! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:21"/> That was, like, 15 minutes of lie. Plus, you don't want to
    meet my mom. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:24"/> I do. Where does she live? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:26"/> Oh, this spectacular elder care facility, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:28"/> {\an8}she has her own private room with a nice view, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:30"/> {\an8}'round-the-clock medical care, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:31"/> {\an8}and plenty of other seniors to say casually cruel things
    to </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:34"/> {\an8}under a passive-aggressive veil of plausible
    deniability. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:37"/> What's this place called? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:38"/> I want to say Whispering Pines. Whistling Pines? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:41"/> Unbelievable. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:43"/> {\an8}Something with a W. Winter's Bone? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:45"/> -Take me there. -<sound noise="groans"/> Fine! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:47"/> {\an8}-For real this time? -Yes. I promise. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:49"/> {\an8}I am not gonna lie to you ever again. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:52"/> -Did you eat the last fudgesicle? -No. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:56"/> I lied. I lied about the fudgesicle. </line>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:00"/> {\an8}<i>All this time you thought</i>
    <i>I was just another damsel in distress,</i>
   </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:08"/> {\an8}Oh... oh. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:10"/> {\an8}-<sound noise="groans"/> That is not good. -Okay. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:12"/> {\an8}Everybody set a Google Alert for "mass shooting." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:14"/> Can't keep getting caught off guard. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:16"/> This is so sad. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:17"/> You always hear about mass shootings affecting other people's
    movie openings, but you never think they're gonna affect <i>your </i>movie opening. <sound
     noise="sobs"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:24"/> My thoughts and prayers to the victims and their families. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:26"/> -Of course. Yeah, thoughts and prayers. -Thoughts and prayers. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:29"/> {\an8}Tragedy like this really puts things in perspective. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:31"/> {\an8}Like, what are we doing sitting in a conference room? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:34"/> {\an8}Life is short. We should have this meeting at a water
    park. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:37"/> Whoa! A water park where people have meetings. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:40"/> -Maybe that's the movie. -I'm sorry, who is this schmuck? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:42"/> I'm Courtney's asexual fake fianc√©. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:44"/> He's a common person/supermodel, being engaged to him makes me
    appear more approachable/glamorous. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:49"/> Okay-slash-whatever. We still have time to cut the mall
    shootout from the film. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:53"/> That still leaves the movie theater shootout, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:55"/> -the shootout at the county fair, the-- -<sound
     noise="vibrations and buzzing"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:58"/> We should probably lose the movie theater shootout. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:01"/> Right. Well, we still have the county fair shootout. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:03"/> -<sound noise="vibrations and buzzing"/> -Oh, dear. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:05"/> -This is a sad day. -What? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:07"/> I gotta take this. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:09"/> -<i>BoJack?</i> -Hi. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:10"/> -Where have you been? <i>-Listen.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:12"/> I'm sorry. I was an awful boyfriend to you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:14"/> I was an awful client, and I was an awful friend. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:17"/> This last year I spent some time away and it made me realize
    how special the people in my life are. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:23"/>


    <i>And you might be</i>

    <i>the most special of them all.</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:25"/> Wow, BoJack. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:26"/>
    <sound noise="chuckles"/> I-- I appreciate that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:28"/> Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is, do you remember the
    name of that super nice elder care facility that we both agreed was the best place for my mom to
    run out the clock? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:38"/> Oh, pluck a duck. It's called Walnut Springs. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:40"/> Walnut Springs! I knew there was a W in there. Bye! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:43"/> -<sound noise="sighs"/> -<sound noise="ringing"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:44"/> What? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:45"/> I feel like I didn't strike the right tone in the last phone
    call. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:48"/> I really am sorry, and the most important thing is, you know
    how dedicated I am to making things right again. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:52"/> Okay. Thank you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:54"/> Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is, turns out there's a
    few Walnut Springses in the SoCal area. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:58"/> It's the one in Santa Barbara, dummy! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:00"/> -Yeesh! Cranky much? Who died? -A lotta people! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:04"/> -<sound noise="panting"/> -Sorry, what did I miss? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:06"/> Courtney's beloved was outlining his plan to curtail gun
    violence. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:09"/> I'm just saying, if people have the right pumped-up kicks,
    maybe they can outrun the bullets. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:16"/> All this talk of gun violence is depressing. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:18"/>
    <i>-Ms. Taken </i>is a movie about empowerment. -That's what I've been saying! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:22"/> It's <i>Bridget Jones</i> with slightly more bloody murdering. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:24"/> We just have to keep the story on Courtney, and not on the
    depressingly unstoppable rise of real-life gun violence in this country, thoughts and prayers. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:32"/> -Thoughts and prayers. -Thoughts and prayers. </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:07:02"/> You are going to write a glowing feature about my client and
    her new movie. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:06"/> -Why would I... -You know Courtney Portnoy. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:08"/> You probably recall when she soared as the thorny
    horticulturist in <i>One Sordid Fortnight</i>
    <i>With the Short-Skirted Sorceress.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:14"/> -Uh... -How would you enjoy joining Portnoy for a scorched soy
    porterhouse pork four-courser at Koi? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:20"/> -Wait, what? -Glorify your source, but don't make it feel
    forced, of course, and try the borscht. Smooches! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:26"/> -<i>Hey--</i> -And that's how you do it, folks. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:31"/> Oh... <sound noise="gasps"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:33"/> You're telling me you didn't feel one twinge of guilt when you
    left your mom in this place? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:37"/> Uh... twinge of guilt, twinge of guilt, trying to remember,
    no. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:40"/> -Definitely not. -Damn. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:42"/> You didn't know my mom. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:44"/> Football? You don't have the haunches for it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:47"/> You'll only embarrass yourself, as in every other endeavor you
    pursue. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:50"/> -But, Mom... -If you're looking to get knocked around for an
    afternoon, why don't you just read one of your father's manuscripts and tell him his prose is
    pedestrian and derivative? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:59"/> Works for me every time. </line>

    <sound noise="inhales and puffs"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:04"/> Mrs. Horseman, you have a visitor. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:09"/> Oh, uh... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:10"/> -Hi, Mom. -Do I know you? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:13"/> Here we go. Yes, Mom, I never visit. You got me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:16"/> -Henrietta? -Okay, we're doing this? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:18"/> I think she really doesn't know who you are. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:20"/> She knows. This is just like when she pretended not to
    recognize me after my shaky choir solo in eighth grade. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:25"/> I had to get a ride home with the pianist who liked to tickle
    a lot more than just the ivories. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:30"/> When I made it home unscathed, she said, "Huh. I guess no one
    wants you." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:33"/> Henrietta, could I trouble you for some orange juice, please? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:37"/> Stop calling me Henrietta! Nobody here's named Henrietta! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:39"/> Henrietta, orange juice. Now! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:41"/> You're not being paid for polite conversation. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:43"/> -BoJack, maybe you should just-- -Oh, hello! It's you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:45"/> Hollyhock. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:46"/> I must apologize for Henrietta. She learned to read on
    secondhand books. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:52"/> Mom, do you really not know who I am? Me, famous BoJack? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:55"/> If you are getting orange juice, I'd love a glass too. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:58"/> Oh. Uh, okay. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:04"/> So you see I'm really quite ordinary and relatable. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:07"/> Yeah, you put your pants on one leg at a time. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:09"/> Well, I step into my pants one leg at a time, then my
    trouser-maidens lift the legs simultaneously to avoid wrinklage. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:16"/> Well, right, of course, why else have trouser-maidens? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:19"/> -Hey.<i> Konichiwa, </i>Princess Mulan. -Just leave us alone,
    okay? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:23"/> I was giving you a compliment. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:24"/> First, <i>konichiwa </i>is not a compliment, it's Japanese for
    hello. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:27"/> Second, I'm not Japanese. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:28"/> Maybe I could put something in that sweet mouth of yours </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:30"/> -so you don't have to talk so much. -Whoa! </line>
   <line>
