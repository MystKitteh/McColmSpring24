    <timestamp data-time="00:00:25"/> BoJack Horseman opens up in an exclusive interview. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:29"/> For the first time ever, we'll hear the real story of the last
    days of Sarah Lynn. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:34"/>
    <sound noise="Paige"/> I don't believe it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:35"/> I left shoe leather in six different states and spun the scoop
    of my career all to get sidetracked by a sit-down with a second-rate celebrity suck-up. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:42"/> Relax. Your story's clearly doing something if they're
    scrambling to do damage control so fast. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:49"/> That's just it, Patience, my sister and lifelong confidante. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:52"/> These schmoozey charlatans will pour syrup all over this stack
    of Shinola and try to tell you it's pancakes. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:57"/> And I'm powerless to prevent it! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:58"/> Don't you have enough dirt for a whole other story? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:00"/> You know full well once I become Baxter's bride, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:03"/> I'm trading board rooms for bedrooms, watches for swatches and
    deadlines for bedtimes. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:07"/> Okay, so then get married and forget about this BoJack story. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:10"/> I mean, who cares, right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:12"/> Patience, you cut to the core like a classic Sinclair. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:14"/> I shall miss making mincemeat of the misdeeds of mischievous
    miscreants, but I must focus on my new mission, as I transition from miss to missus. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:22"/> Why do you talk like that? We're from Fresno. </line>

    <sound noise="theme music playing"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:23"/> Huh, they're really hyping up this BoJack interview. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:26"/> I gotta admit I'm kinda curious. You're gonna watch, right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:29"/> No. I can't waste my energy getting worked up about that guy,
    Guy. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:32"/> I've done enough of that. Like, years of that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:34"/> -Yeah, but it's not like you can just-- -I need to work on my
    book. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:37"/> These mall-related mysteries aren't gonna solve themselves. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:39"/> Spoken like a very emotionally healthy woman, productive
    professional writer and super-cute girlfriend. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:44"/> We already know what BoJack's gonna say. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:46"/> He'll admit to everything in the story, but nothing else. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:48"/> He'll trot out this sad-sack routine, everyone will feel bad
    for him. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:51"/> He'll talk about his addictions. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:52"/> "Showbiz is awful. My parents were abusive." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:54"/> He'll say he's changed. That he's not that guy anymore. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:56"/> -Yeah. You sound real done with it. -I am! I'm just saying. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:59"/> They'll make you feel bad for him, without it being too sad... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:01" sub="{\an8}"/>...because too sad is a bring-down. We wanna shoot
    for pensive. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:05"/> And this will keep you from talking with your hands, which can
    be construed as aggressive. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:09"/> And whatever you do, don't get defensive! Don't deny anything,
    and don't argue. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:13" sub="{\an8}"/>-<sound noise="sighs"/> -Give me a smile. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:15" sub="{\an8}"/>Uh... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:16" sub="{\an8}"/>Whoa! Am I my third favorite Bruce Springsteen
    song </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:19" sub="{\an8}"/>because I was not "Born in the USA" nor am I
    "Tougher Than the Rest," but I am "Blinded By the Light"! Nice smile, buddy. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:25"/> Do you need to be here right now? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:27" sub="{\an8}"/>Since your interview is leading into the season
    finale of "Birthday Dad," </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:30" sub="{\an8}"/>I wanted to officially welcome you to the MBN
    Thursday Night family. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:34"/> Thank you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:35" sub="{\an8}"/>And to ask if it wouldn't be too much trouble for
    you </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:37" sub="{\an8}"/>to shout out "Birthday Dad" during your interview? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:40" sub="{\an8}"/>-Why would I-- -But only if the interview is going
    well. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:42" sub="{\an8}"/>If the interview is going poorly, please do not
    bring up "Birthday Dad." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:46"/> -<sound noise="baby cooing"/> -Hey, Princess Carolyn, I-- Oh.
    BoJack. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:48"/> -Getting ready for the interview? -Yeah. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:50" sub="{\an8}"/>Oh! You've got your work cut out for you, because
    people hate you right now. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:55" sub="{\an8}"/>-I'm aware, thank you. -That story... Wow. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:57" sub="{\an8}"/>Really well-written, huh? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:59" sub="{\an8}"/>Yeah, the power of the prose was not the first
    thing I noticed. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:02" sub="{\an8}"/>Haunting. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:04"/> Anyway, Princess Carolyn, is it cool if I take tomorrow night
    off for a date with Maude? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:09"/> Todd, I keep hearing about this new girlfriend of yours. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:12"/> When do I meet her? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:13"/> You can probably take this part of the conversation elsewhere. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:16"/> Right this way. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:17"/> We should go on a double date with you and Pickles! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:19"/> Pickles and I are putting our relaysh on a brief hiate at the
    mo, but as soon as she returns from her work trip... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:23"/> -<sound noise="phone buzzes"/> -Uh, oh! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:24"/> Excuse me, I'm receiving a text message and it appears we have
    broken up forever. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:31"/> -You're gonna be great. -<sound noise="exhales"/> Yeah. Where
    are we doing this? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:34"/> I got them to take the "Philbert" set out of storage. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:36"/> Why? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:37"/> Because we want the intimacy and vulnerability of your home. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:39"/> You're saying, "This is me. No more lies." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:43"/> But since we're pre-taping it in the afternoon, we're using
    the set to make it look like it's nighttime. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:47"/> Makes sense. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:48" sub="{\an8}"/>
    <sound noise="jingle playing"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:52"/> I'm here with BoJack Horseman in his actual house. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:56"/> BoJack, a story came out this morning about the last days of
    Sarah Lynn. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:00"/> How did it make you feel? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:01"/> Honestly? I felt relieved that now I can stop lying. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:05"/> -<sound noise="light crashes"/> -<sound noise="grunts"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:08"/> -Are the allegations in the story true? -<sound
     noise="clears throat"/> They are. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:11"/> Sarah Lynn was nine months sober. I invited her on a bender. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:14"/> We spiraled together for a little over a month and then she
    overdosed. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:17"/> On heroin you purchased for her? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:19"/> -Well, I didn't purchase it for her-- -There's no need to get
    defensive. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:22"/> I'm just trying to be accurate. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:24"/> I-I didn't purchase it at all. I just had it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:26"/>
    <sound noise="Biscuits"/> You just had heroin? Lying around. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:28"/> No, no, no, no, not <i>lying around.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:30"/>
    <sound noise="scoffs"/> You're making it sound like I had extra heroin, because I do so much
    heroin. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:34"/> I had that heroin because I wasn't doing heroin. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:37"/> So, I had it. You understand? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:39"/> In your original statement to the police, you said she called
    you, you came to the planetarium and found her. That was a lie. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:46"/> Yes. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:47"/> Would you say Sarah Lynn dying was your rock bottom? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:50"/> I don't believe in rock bottoms. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:52"/> I've had a lot of what I thought were rock bottoms only to
    discover </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:55"/> -another rockier bottom underneath. -That sounds dangerous. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:59"/> Eventually, I decided to stop waiting for something to change
    me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:03"/> I had to make the change myself. And that's why I went to
    rehab. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:06"/> And I'm very proud to be one year sober next month. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:08"/> So, if I'm understanding you correctly, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:09"/> Sarah Lynn dying was part of that decision? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:12"/> Uh, it was part of it, yes. Uh, I've made a lot of mistakes. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:17"/> Can you share some of those other mistakes? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:19"/> I... I don't think that it would be fair to the people who
    were affected by those mistakes, all of whom I've apologized to in private. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:26"/> Now that you're sober, do you think you'll stop making these
    mistakes? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:29"/> I do. It's been a lot of work, but I look back at that other
    BoJack and I think, "Who is that?" </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:34"/> And who was he? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:37"/> I came from a broken home, and I used to feel like my whole
    life was an acting job. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:42"/> Just doing an impression of the people I saw on television,
    which was just the projection of a bunch of equally screwed-up writers and actors. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:49"/> I felt like a Xerox of a Xerox of a person, you know what I
    mean? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:53"/> -But not anymore? -No. Now I feel like me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:57"/> It must have been difficult to see those same patterns repeat
    themselves with Sarah Lynn. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:01"/> I think that's why her death was so scary for me, why I didn't
    wanna confront it, because she reminded me of myself. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:10"/> Some have accused Sarah Lynn's mother of exploiting her death. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:12"/> When you hear "All Twerk and No Play" in a Geico commercial,
    or see Sarah Lynn's face on a billboard with the slogan "I'd die for a Pepsi," </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:20"/> -how does that make you feel? -Sad. Angry. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:23"/> Honestly, it feels like that's what killed her. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:25"/> Not the heroin? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:26"/> No, you're right. It was mostly the heroin. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:29"/> If you could talk to her mother now, what would you say to
    her? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:32"/> I would say... I wish you could know... how sorry I am. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:40"/>


    <sound noise="gasps"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:44"/> -Am I crazy or did I nail that? -It was good. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:47"/> Oh, man, when she brought up Sarah Lynn's mother? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:49"/> She was setting me up to throw her under the bus, but then I
    said I'm sorry? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:53"/> I mean, that was a sweet move, yeah? I felt like I could see
     <i>The Matrix!</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:57"/> You've definitely gotten your 10,000 hours in when it comes to
    apologizing. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:01"/> It was good, right? People are gonna like it? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:03"/> Yeah, well, we'll find out in three hours when it airs. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:10"/> And that's why the band Chicago is not one of the top ten
    Chicago bands of all time. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:15"/> Uh-huh. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:18"/> Hmm, it's okay if you wanna watch. All right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:20"/> He's your friend, it's a big deal for him. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:22"/> -You don't have to be so weird about it. -I'm not being weird.
    I'm in a good place. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:25"/> I don't wanna get dragged back into that other stuff. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:28"/> That's great! But, you know, it is a little weird that one of
    your best friends is a huge celebrity </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:32"/> -and you never wanna talk about him. -Roxy's really more my
    "best" best friend. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:35"/> But you never talk about Roxy either! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:36"/> I don't understand what her job is and it's too late for me to
    ask. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:39"/> And you were also married to a huge celebrity. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:41"/> And you never talk about him either. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:42"/> You don't share your past life with me. You wanna talk about
    weird? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:45"/> I've lived here six months and I still haven't met your son. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:48"/>
    <sound noise="stammers"/> Okay. But you don't really wanna meet Sonny. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:52"/> Of course I do! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:53"/> All right, cool. Let's get dinner tomorrow. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:54"/> "Tomorrow" tomorrow? </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:25"/> Wow. I had no idea. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:26"/> And I see no reason why you shouldn't return to Wesleyan. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:31"/> Uh, small latte? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:32"/> -My manager told me not to charge you. -What? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:34"/> He said he watched your interview last night, then turned off

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:39"/> Huh. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:40"/> No "Birthday Dad." </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:51"/> You just bought us six more months of not having to sell

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:10:20"/> Makes sense. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:10:21"/> We got what we wanted out of this. I don't think we should
    push it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:10:24"/> We're starting a dialogue. I'm helping people. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:10:27"/> Move over, Sad Dog. Make room for Remorse Horse! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:10:30"/> That's great BoJack, but-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:10:31"/> Listen, I'm ready to move on and go back to Connecticut, but
    it does feel good to be part of the conversation again. </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:11:00"/> Oh, here we go. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:02"/> Speaking of addicts, I think you're addicted to Sarah Lynn! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:04"/>
    <sound noise="chuckles"/> You told the police you weren't with her when she died. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:07"/> That she called you from the planetarium. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:09"/> Yes, I lied. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:10"/> Weren't you afraid the police would check the phone records? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:13"/> Oh! Well, I wasn't thinking clearly. Guess I'm not a criminal
    mastermind! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:16"/> But the police did check the phone records, and your story
    checked out. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:20"/> There was a two-minute phone call made from her phone to your
    phone, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:23"/> 17 minutes before you called 911. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:27"/> -Oh? -If you were with her, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:29"/> -how do you explain the phone call? -I, um... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:32"/> I called myself. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:33"/> After I realized what had had happened, I took her phone and I
    called myself so I could make it look like she called me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:39"/> -Why? -I went into panic mode. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:41"/> And then what did you do? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:42"/> I thought we were gonna talk about other stuff. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:44"/> What did you do after you called your own phone, BoJack? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:46"/> I went outside to the parking lot. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:48"/> And you just waited there for 17 minutes? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:52"/> Why are you asking about this? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:57"/> Biscuits Braxby. Paige Sinclair. You've been had. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:11:59"/> A pleasure to meet you. Had by who? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:01"/> The pleasure is mine, the pronoun is whom, and the whom is the
    horse. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:04"/> BoJack? I got him to spill his guts about the worst moment of
    his life </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:10"/> Your disgusting display of soft-pedaling sycophancy made me
    wanna quit the journalism business altogether, two days prior to when I get married and quit the
    journalism business altogether. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:18"/> But the Biscuits Braxby brand is keeping things light. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:20"/> Celebs come on my show because I make 'em look good. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:22"/> That access keeps me relevant. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:24"/> But to what benefit is your relevance if it's squandered in
    the service of public relations? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:28"/> With the advent of social media, celebs don't need you to make
    them look good. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:31"/> And if you don't alter your strategy soon, you'll have no
    career left to save. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:34"/> Face it, chinchilla, you're all wet. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:37"/> Well, I... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:38"/> Ugh! Even if I wanted to do a hard-hitting interview, what
    would I say? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:42"/> I've a few ideas... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:46"/> -You keep looking over to your manager. -Well, I-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:48"/> -Can we talk about your relationship? -Princess Carolyn? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:50"/> -You dated her for seven years? -Yes, and look! She's alive. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:53"/> Did it ever get complicated, working with her while
    maintaining a sexual relationship? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:12:58"/> Well, she's always been good at keeping her personal and
    professional lives separate. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:01"/> -Quite an accomplished woman. -You said it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:03"/> She was an agent's assistant when I met her and now she's
    running her own company. Plus, she's a great mom. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:09"/>
    <sound noise="chuckles"/> Oh, fish! Mom! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:11"/> -I forgot about Todd's date! -I can watch Ruthie for a few

    <timestamp data-time="00:13:14"/>
    <sound noise="whispers"/> Thank you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:15"/> What can you tell me about Marcy Jerominek? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:18"/> -Who? -In the '90s, you had a fan club-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:19"/> -How do you know all this? -Do you know where I'm going here? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:22"/>
    <sound noise="sighs"/> Marcy. Yes. She was the president of my fan club. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:25"/> You slept with her. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:26"/> We had a lovely evening together. We both got something out of
    it, and-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:30"/> Did you take a high school girl to her prom? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:33"/> -That was a family friend. -Did you help a teen mom sneak out
    of rehab and take her to a high school party? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:38"/> I didn't <i>take</i> her. We went together. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:40"/> Is it true you once dated a woman who'd just woken up from a
    30-year coma? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:43"/> -Were you attracted to her naivet√©, too? -What does all this
    have to with-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:46"/> You had sex with the president of your fan club. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:48"/> You had sex with your agent's assistant. You party with
    underage girls. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:52"/> -You don't see a pattern here? -It's not a pattern. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:54"/> -Do you enjoy having power over women? -I don't even know what
    that means. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:57"/> You don't know what it means to have power over women? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:13:59"/> I don't have power over anyone. I barely have power over
    myself. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:03"/> But you do have power over people. And again and again, you
    abuse that power. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:07"/> All these women that you mentioned, I never forced myself-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:10"/> Not through force, but you understand the power differential. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:12"/> So, I can't be with any woman I might have power over? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:16"/> -Who does that leave me with? -I'm just pointing out a series
    of-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:18"/> You think everything is this nefarious scheme. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:21"/> Most of the bad shit that happens in this world isn't because
    of wicked plots and machinations. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:25"/> It's just because we're all a bunch of stupid, hungry, horny
    little goons just grabbing at shit, hoping it'll press that little button in our brain that
    says, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:33"/> "Okay, you're happy now." That's not an "abuse of power." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:37"/> Do you really believe you didn't have the power in all of
    those relationships? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:41"/> I... I am an addict. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:44"/> One of the first things that I had to accept was my own
    powerlessness. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:47"/> -But that's-- -I understand what I did was wrong. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:49"/> I'm not denying that. But you're trying to paint this picture. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:51"/> You're making it out like I'm a bad guy, and I'm not. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:54"/> I'm not that guy you're saying I am. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:56"/> -So, back to Sarah Lynn... -No. Why? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:58"/> You gave her the heroin... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:59"/> I already told you, yes. How many times can I say it? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:02"/> Breaking news! The thing I told you yesterday is still true. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:05"/> -Did you ever give Sarah Lynn alcohol? -What? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:07"/> The first time Sarah Lynn ever got drunk, she was a child, and
    it was vodka, right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:11"/> How... how do you know about that? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:13"/> You were bringing vodka to the set of "Horsin' Around." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:16"/> Who told you all this stuff? Did Sharona tell you that? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:23"/> Doctor Champ, thank you for returning my call. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:25"/> I didn't wanna say anything, but just watching BoJack in that
    interview, talking like he's a victim in all this. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:31"/> If the world only knew the things I know... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:34"/> I understand as a therapist, you're not at liberty to divulge
    what your client told you in confidence. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:39"/> But I'm not a therapist. I'm a therapy horse. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:42"/> And I can tell you everything. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:44"/> Oh. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:45"/> Because Sharona was a drunk, too, so you can't trust a thing
    she says. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:48"/> Obviously, she has a vendetta against me. Besides, I already
    apologized to her. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:52"/> Apologized for what? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:54"/> Okay, when you put it all together, it looks bad. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:56"/> Do you see any connection between those other women and Sarah
    Lynn? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:59"/> There's no connection between anyone, that's what I keep
    saying! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:02"/> Sarah Lynn wasn't like those other girls. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:05"/> I loved Sarah Lynn. She was like a daughter to me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:08"/> I just keep seeing this story of you taking young women... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:11"/> -No. -Grooming them... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:12"/> I didn't <i>groom</i> anyone, okay? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:14"/> It's not like I got Sarah Lynn drunk for the purpose of taking
    advantage of her. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:17"/> She was ten! I didn't even have sex with her until she was 30! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:20"/> -I'm sorry, what? -No. I just mean that-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:22"/> -Did you say you had sex with her? -That was later. She was an
    adult. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:25"/> And we were both so drunk and high, I didn't-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:28"/> We didn't know what we were doing. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:30"/> We were addicts, and the thing about addicts-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:32"/> -This was during your bender? -Yeah. No! A different bender. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:35"/> I took her to rehab, by the way! I tried to get her help. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:38"/> I just keep thinking about those 17 minutes. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:40"/> You waiting in the parking lot after she died. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:44"/> But she wasn't actually dead yet. She died in the hospital. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:47"/> -Right, but at the time, I didn't... -Ever wonder what
    would've happened if you didn't take those 17 minutes? Do you think she might still-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:53"/> No! I... Look, obviously when I did all that stuff, I wasn't-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:55"/> So to recap, you gave Sarah Lynn alcohol when she was a child. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:59"/> She then became an addict. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:01"/> Come on, there was a lot of stuff in between-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:02"/> I'm talking now. You're not talking. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:05"/> When she was intoxicated, you had sex with her, and when she
    was sober, you gave her the heroin that killed her. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:10"/> Then in an effort to cover for yourself, you waited to call
    the paramedics that might have saved her life. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:17"/> And you don't think you have any power over women. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:24"/> So, it didn't go great. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:26"/> The gross part is she doesn't even care. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:28"/> This is just a ratings win she can use as leverage for her
    next big paycheck. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:31"/> -Maybe. -She was all over the place. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:33"/> I think people are gonna see that she was just out to get me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:35"/> -People are gonna see that, right? -I guess we'll find out
    tonight. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:38"/> Okay, maybe she had some good points, but she completely
    undermined herself with, like... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:43"/> I mean, we dated for like seven years. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:45"/> Do you think that I took advantage of you? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:47"/> -<sound noise="sighs"/> I'm here, aren't I? -And she kept
    bringing it back to women-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:50"/> These "women I hurt" because that's what's hip now, right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:53"/> Hurting women? But I have also hurt a lot of men! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:56"/> I told you to do just the one interview and go back to
    Connecticut. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:00"/> -But it's gonna be okay, right? -<sound noise="sighs"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:04"/> You wanna grab some tacos? What do you think? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:06"/> -I think you have three hours... -<sound
     noise="car alarm chirps"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:09"/> ...before this interview airs and your world changes
    completely. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:12"/> You should think about how you wanna spend that time. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:15"/> I'm going home to my daughter. </line>
