            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:17"/> I created a dating app for firefighters to meet

                Yeah. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:22"/> Hey! We should create a dating app for asexuals. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:26"/> Why would asexuals want a dating app? </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:28"/> Well, not all asexuals are aromantic. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:31"/> -Uh... -Think of it this way. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:33"/> One could be: A, Romantic, or B, Aromantic, while
                also being A, Sexual, or B, Asexual. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:41"/> So you could be BB, or BA. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:44"/> As for me, see AB, see? </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:46"/> Uh... </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:47"/> So, even within the one percent of the population
                that's asexual, there's an even smaller percentage that is still looking for
                romantic companionship. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:56"/> Seems like a pretty thin user base for an app. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:10:59"/> But without it, asexual romantics might end up
                settling for just whatever other asexual romantics they might meet, even if they
                have nothing else in common. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:11:07"/> -Well, anyway-- -Yeah, but maybe it's good if they
                have nothing in common because then they can help each other grow and change, and
                become fuller, more well-rounded people. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:11:17"/> Yeah, that's true. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:11:18"/> So, Todd, are you still doing that rabid
                clown-dentist exercise thing? </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:11:22"/> Oh, no, that whole thing kinda fell apart when the
                clowns got loose. </line>
