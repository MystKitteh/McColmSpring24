   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:32" sub="{\an8}" />which will remain on that whiteboard forever, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:34" sub="{\an8}" />and this is Intermediate Scene Study. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:36" sub="{\an8}" />What is acting? Anyone? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:38"/> -<sound noise="all"/> Ooh! -Oh! Okay. You. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:41" sub="{\an8}" />According to Stanislothski, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:42" sub="{\an8}" />acting is the desire to create inside of oneself </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:45" sub="{\an8}" />another, deeper, more interesting life </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:47" sub="{\an8}" />than the one that actually surrounds him... or her. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:50"/> -Oh, okay, yes, but also... Yes? -<sound noise="girl"/> Oh! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:53" sub="{\an8}" />Meisner would say, "Acting is behaving truthfully under
    imaginary circumstances." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:57"/> Acting is behaving truthfully under imaginary circumstances. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:00"/> Uh, okay, wow. So, that's acting. But what is--? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:03" sub="{\an8}" />Guys, I'm concerned this class is getting very
    theory-qua-theory... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:06"/> I was about to say that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:08" sub="{\an8}" />...when technique should be a means toward a more
    engaging art. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:11"/> -Well, quite astute. -Sorry, horse professor. What's acting? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:14" sub="{\an8}" />Um... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:15" sub="{\an8}" />Acting is the, um... <sound noise="grunts"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:18"/> Acting is... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:20"/> Uh... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:22" sub="{\an8}" />I don't know what acting is. I don't know what I'm
    doing. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:26"/> I shouldn't be here. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:27"/> -<sound noise="boy"/> Wow. -<sound noise="girl"/> Oh! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:29" sub="{\an8}" />No, I don't want to quit. I'm acting! That's acting. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:33"/> Oh! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:34"/> Class dismissed. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:36"/> But we still have an hour and 20 minutes left. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:38"/> Yes. Again, I was acting. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:40"/> You sounded serious. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:42"/> Instead of judging my acting, how about you act and I judge
    you? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:45" sub="{\an8}" />-For real? -Yeah. Good point. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:46" sub="{\an8}" />We could show you the scenes we were working on last
    semester. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:49"/> Uh, sure. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:51" sub="{\an8}" />-This is from "Kablammo, Mother." -Whenever you're
    ready. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:55" sub="{\an8}" />Mama, where's Daddy's old World War II grenade with the
    pin still in it? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:59"/>
    <sound noise="in British accent"/> Why would you want an old thing like that? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:02"/> Tonight, I intend to explode myself. Where are the extra
    towels? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:07"/> -Okay, okay. Stop, stop. -What? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:09" sub="{\an8}" />-Does this play take place in England? -<sound
     noise="normal voice"/> No. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:11" sub="{\an8}" />So why are you talking with an English accent? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:14"/> I'm acting. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:15"/> Just as an exercise, maybe use your normal voice. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:18" sub="{\an8}" />And Tawnie, when you're telling your mother you're gonna
    kill yourself, the next line is, "Where are the extra towels," right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:24"/> And the character's being very casual, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:26" sub="{\an8}" />so maybe she should also be casual when she says she's
    gonna kill herself. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:29" sub="{\an8}" />Like it's a big deal, but it's not a big deal for her. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:31"/> -Like that's the irony of the scene. -Whoa! That's really
    smart. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:35"/> Yeah. Yeah, it is. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:38"/> Okay, let's see it again. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:40"/> So, darling, what fun and games shall we play? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:44"/> Shall we play Scattergories? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:46"/>
    <sound noise="raspy voice"/> I detest Scattergories! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:48"/> Whatever the prompt, you always answer in vague allusions to
    the baby we never had! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:53"/> Stop. You're both talking to the audience. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:55"/> I want you to talk to each other, you're having a
    conversation. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:59"/> -Hey! Who's you? -Who's me? Screw you is who's me! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:03"/> I got the leads. The Gooba Gooberry Falls leads. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:06"/> Mm! Them's them good leads. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:09"/> -Hubba hubba, I'm horny for leads! -Okay, here's my question
    for you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:12"/> Does your character know he's horny for leads, or is he
    discovering it? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:17"/> Who's next? Great. What's the scene? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:19"/> The scene is I'm late for my next class. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:21"/> We were supposed to get out 20 minutes ago. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:23"/> Oh, shit. Sorry. See you Wednesday. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:25"/> Great work today. Way to go, team. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:27"/> We did it. That was great, huh? How good was I? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:31"/> -<sound noise="sighs"/> -<sound noise="door closes"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:36"/> Whitfield, we've been here six weeks. How do you think this is
    going? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:40"/> -I think I'm crushing it. -Wow, okay. Well, I admire the
    confidence. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:44"/> I know you're an acting major. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:45"/> And I guess I just-- I wanted to make sure that you're taking
    other classes. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:50"/> Like, Economics, or maybe a plumbing course. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:54"/> Or rental car cashier class? I don't know. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:56"/> What would you want to do if the acting thing doesn't work
    out? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:58"/> Hold up, do you think I'm not a good actor? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:00"/> Whoa, whoa, whoa! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:01"/> You said "Not a good actor." But now that you've said it... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:05"/> Some would say there are no bad actors, only bad teachers. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:08"/> What about Jason Segel? He was a bad actor in <i>Bad
     Teacher.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:11"/> I am a wonderful actor. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:14"/> You'll see. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:16"/> -<sound noise="door closes"/> -Okay. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:20"/> She knew I was drunk, but she still let me drive off with
    Jonathan. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:24"/> Whoa, oh! I'm a drunk! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:27"/> Jesus, I had no idea, I-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:28"/> Booze has taken everything from me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:31"/> -My job as an airline pilot, my wife. -Huh? What the--? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:34"/> Those two things. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:35"/>
    <sound noise="sighs"/> Okay. I see what's happening. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:37"/> Sorry, everybody. This is one of my acting students. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:40"/> -He's trying to, um-- -Who's Whitfield? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:42"/> -Nobody said "Whitfield." -My name is Whip Whitaker. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:45"/> -Did you follow me here? -I drank the vodka bottles on the
    plane. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:48"/> Drove the plane upside-downsy. Yeah, I'm drunk now. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:52"/> -Wow. -No, don't-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:53"/> We've all been there, man. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:54"/> He hasn't been there. That's the plot of the movie
     <i>Flight.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:57"/> Glug, glug, glug. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:59"/> -That wet the ol' whistle. -So sorry, everyone. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:01"/> Now I'm completely over the 0.8 percent blood alcohol level. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:05"/> -I'm in trouble. I am wasted. -This is very disrespectful. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:08"/> -Hammered... -We work hard to create a safe space here. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:11"/> -...tanked, blitzed... -So sorry about that. I recognize that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:13"/> -...Irish, canned, smashed... -I value this room, just know
    that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:16"/> -...annihilated, laced, faded. -Really sorry about all of
    this. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:19"/> -So sorry. -In conclusion, I am a drunk. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:23"/> The big D. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:26"/> -Fine. Shut up. You're a drunk. -Aha! Wrong, I was acting! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:30"/> It appears the student has become the student-er. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:34"/>


    <sound noise="sighing"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:36"/> Wow, an actor. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:42"/> -Uh... <sound noise="grunts"/> -<sound noise="crowd cheering"

    <sound noise="both grunt"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:50"/> Foul! That fowl fouled, ref! Where's the whistle? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:53"/> -Ugh! -There are women tossing women everywhere! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:57"/> What is this, the Running of the Brides at Filene's Basement? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:59"/> Who's with me? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:01"/>


    <sound noise="slurps"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:03"/> Okay. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:04"/> -Um, they're allowed to do that in rugby. -What? Really? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:07"/> Also, nobody knows what Filene's Basement is. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:10"/> That's a shame. You definitely paid too much for that coat. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:12"/> -<sound noise="whistle trills"/> -Oh, is it over? Did we win? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:17"/>
    <sound noise="exhales"/> Hey, you're really good. I think. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:19"/> Don't feel like you have to come to these things if it's not
    your thing. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:23"/> No, I liked it. Look at us. Doing college. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:26"/> I'm just saying you have your things and I have my things.
    It's okay. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:31"/> -You wanna get something to eat? -I-I can't. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:33"/> When we win, we all go to Conspiracy to celebrate. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:36"/> -Sounds fun. Can I join you? -I don't think you should. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:39"/> It's a bar, and there will be alcohol there. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:42"/> -That's okay. -And young girls. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:43"/> -What's that have to do with anything? -Nothing. Just stating
    a fact. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:48"/> -Okay. Well, then, I guess I'll see you. -Wouldn't wanna be
    you! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:51"/> But I would. You're cool. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:54"/> Thank you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:56"/> Hmm. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:01"/> Yes, good. Keep doing what they're doing. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:04"/>
    <sound noise="sighs"/> Tawnie, you're Hollyhock's best friend... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:07"/> -We're actually in a fight right now. -Again? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:09"/> Our fights are like Adele songs. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:11"/> All kind of the same one, but with different specifics. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:14"/> -Well, do you understand this rugby thing? -Uh, honestly? No. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:18"/> She came back from winter break super aggro, but that's
    Hollyhock, right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:21"/> Suddenly, she decides, "This is what I'm all about now, and
    everyone else just has to get on board." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:25"/> What are we supposed to do with that? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:27"/> -Whoa! -I guess... get on board. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:31"/>


    <sound noise="whistle trills"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:32"/> Get it out, get it-- Yes, nice. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:34"/> Nice run! Very nice! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:36"/> Touchdown! That's my sister! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:38"/> Good try! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:39"/> Try? She did it. She scored. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:41"/> It's called a try. </line>
   <line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:19:50"/> -Uh-huh. -This showcase is a big deal. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:53"/> This might sound crazy coming from famous television star,
    BoJack Horseman, but in some ways, this showcase means even more to me than the very popular TV

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:04"/> -It means a lot to me, too. -Does it? </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:20:26"/> -This has to stop. -What? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:27"/> This is a place for people who are serious about making a
    change, not for desperate acting students pretending to have problems, Amy. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:34"/> I was just trying to get help! </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:20:35"/> -Oof! -<sound noise="crying"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:36"/> Oh! Oops! That was... </line>
   <line>

    to start. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:53"/> So keep your rugby voice on the field, okay? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:55"/> It turns out my hypothesis was correct. Kids love
    marshmallows. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:59"/> You don't say. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:00"/> You still working on that memoir? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:02"/> Well, funny story about that... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:04"/> Oh, I love when stories start like that! Ooh! You should put
    this one in your book. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:11"/> Where the hell is she? </line>

   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:40"/> Well, I mean, you'll see for yourself, uh... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:42"/> But, um, I'm proud of them. </line>
   <line>

   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:19"/> I'm sorry. I forgot. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:21"/> I know your students just have to do a scene, but I have
    multiple final papers. </line>
   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:29"/> But people came all the way from California to see my
    showcase. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:31"/> From Chicago. You can't even walk across campus? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:34"/> Okay, let me put some pants on. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:37"/> -You've been avoiding me all semester. -I just have a lot
    going on. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:40"/> I go to school here. I'm a college student. </line>
   <line>

    here. </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:49"/> And you could have asked me, by the way. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:52"/> Okay, I'm sorry. I guess I thought my sister... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:55"/> No, don't say that. Like it means something. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:58"/> -It does mean something. -We don't know each other, really. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:01"/> -What? -No, I'm just saying it's fine. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:04"/> I had a life before I met you, and you had a life before you
    met me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:09"/> I don't want that life. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:10"/> That life, that person? That's not who I am, I... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:15"/> I'm sorry I came here without asking you first. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:18"/> That was selfish. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:19"/> Okay. Thank you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:21"/> If this is too weird for you, I don't have to come back next
    semester. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:25"/> I can get a job somewhere else. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:27"/> Tawnie says you're a really good teacher. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:30"/> She did? Huh. I thought you were in a fight. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:32"/> Yeah, but I still love her. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:35"/> Are we in a fight? </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:39"/> Yeah. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:41"/> I should get back to the show. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:42"/> If you want to come back in the fall, that could be cool. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:47"/> -Yeah? -Just... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:48"/> We need to take things slow, you know? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:51"/> Yeah. I know. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:54"/> Thanks. </line>
