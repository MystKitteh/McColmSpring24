   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:11"/> Because we need clean clothes. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:13"/> The point is: helium luggage. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:15"/> Why pack light when you can pack lighter than air? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:17"/> All right, so Mom's too sick to come out of her room but not
    too sick to make her famous Frito pie? </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:07:00"/> She can't say hello? The woman has my kidney! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:02"/> And that's why she's ashamed. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:04"/> A mother shouldn't owe her child her life. </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:18:20"/> Tell me what it's like to be Diane. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:23"/> Okay. When you're Diane, you can live your whole life like
    it's a puzzle, put together from the pieces of different sets. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:34"/> Like a crossover puzzle? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:36"/> Exactly. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:37"/> Your whole life is full of these pieces that don't quite fit. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:40"/> Sounds like a hard puzzle. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:42"/> But at some point, you start to think it's you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:46"/>


    <i>You're the piece that doesn't quite fit.</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:49"/>


    <i>And you spend so long with that feeling</i>

    <i>that the feeling becomes your home.</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:55"/> And it can be jarring when you discover one day that you
    suddenly don't feel that way anymore. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:01"/> At first, you don't trust it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:03"/> But then, gradually, you do. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:06"/> I'm sorry. That was a weird thing to be telling my ex-husband. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:09"/> No. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:11"/> -I'm really happy for you, Diane. <i>-It's funny.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:14"/> I feel like if we met each other as the people we are now,
    things would be totally different with us. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:19"/> Yeah, but if we hadn't met each other until now, we wouldn't
    be the people we are now. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:26"/> Yeah. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:27"/> Two equally accomplished book writers. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:31"/> Uh-huh. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:33"/> -<sound noise="roars, laughs"/> -<sound noise="screams"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:35"/> You suffered an anxiety attack. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:37"/> I'd encourage you to avoid stressful situations like, uh, fake
    kidnappings under abandoned bridges. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:44"/> Okay, paperwork time. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:45"/> You seem like a fellow who enjoys unnecessary bureaucracy. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:49"/> I do, Doctor. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:51"/> Mm, was that the bridge where they shot <i>Grease?</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:55"/> -Yeah! -That's neat. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:58"/> Todd, I'm so sorry! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:00"/> Oh, no, I know you didn't mean to-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:02"/> I thought kicking you out was the right thing. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:05"/> You were 18. You had dropped out of high school. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:08"/> You were always high. You only wore flip-flops. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:10"/> -You never showered. -You don't have to list everything. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:13"/> I wanted you to grow up, not leave forever. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:16"/> Then more and more time passed and I didn't know how to make
    it right. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:20"/> Truth is, I did grow up. Your plan worked. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:23"/> I haven't had a mom for so long, I... I don't really need one
    anymore. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:28"/> Oh. So, what do we do now? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:31"/> Well, I do have one idea. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:34"/> -What? -A big robot suit like in <i>Aliens,</i> but for babies
    so they can do grown-up things! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:40"/> -That sounds dangerous. -Yeah, I guess it is. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:45"/> But maybe the robots could be powered by energy generated from
    sucking on pacifiers. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:51"/> That is so smart! Babies love sucking and right now it's just
    wasted energy! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:57"/>
    <sound noise="Margo's voice"/> And so you see, the circle had become complete. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:00"/> All the twists and turns had all been part of a beautiful
    tapestry, a grander mission to bring this boy and his mother together again. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:10"/> That's quite a story. But you've killed a lot of people. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:13"/> -Margo Martindale, you're going to pris-- -<sound
     noise="woman"/> Wait! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:18"/> You can't send her to jail before she gets to act in one of my
    movies! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:21"/> Indie filmmaker Nicole Holofcener? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:24"/> I find it hard to believe Margo Martindale has never appeared
    in your work. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:28"/> It's true! And I need her to play the mother of the poetry
    student </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:31"/> Catherine Keener has an affair with in my new film, "Classroom
    Warfare." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:35"/> Ooh! Can I, Mr. Judge? Please? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:38"/> Damn, that does sound good. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:41"/> Okay, you're free to go. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:43"/> Yee-haw! </line>
   <line>

   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:11"/> This is terrible. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:15"/> Well, hello. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:18"/> Who put pills in my house? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:27"/> Judah, you were supposed to have the night off! Your hair is
    so long! </line>
   <line>

   </line>
   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:35"/> Would you think I was an idiot if I didn't go work for
    Turteltaub? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:38"/> I would never think you were an idiot. </line>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:43"/> We could get some financiers and do it ourselves, right? </line>
   <line>

    underestimate what Princess Carolyn can do by herself. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:52"/> Well, not all by myself. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:55"/> Well... <sound noise="chuckles"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:56"/> I've got the babysitter 'til 11:00. We might as well keep
