            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:00:24"/> Perfect day to go outside, not read the trades or
                talk to anyone in the industry or watch entertainment television or have a gut
                feeling about the ratings for your television show last night. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:00:33"/> - Princess Carolyn, I'm dying. - You read the
                trades. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:00:36"/> My heart is in my stomach, my stomach is in my
                butt, and my butt ran away with the spoon. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:00:41"/> That makes sense because your butt is quite a
                dish. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:00:44"/> Can you come over? I need you. </line>

            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:00:52"/> I ordered a few feel better pizzas to feel better.
                It did not work. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:00:56"/> Then I sprinkled happy pills on them, and washed
                it all down with a "Please, God, make my pain go away" vermouth and ice cream float. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:03"/> - Somehow I feel worse. - That's a real mystery. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:05"/> My show was terrible. Why did I insist on a
                mockumentary format? </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:09"/> It's already an overused trope now, in 2007. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:12"/> Mockumentary is not a trope, it's a device for
                storytelling. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:16"/> And your show is daring and cutting edge. People
                just aren't ready. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:19"/> Yeah, people! It's not me. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:22"/> It's the people that are the problem! </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:24"/> Everyone's dumb and I am great. Why do I always
                forget that? </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:27"/> That's the spirit. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:28"/> I'm starting to think this show is the best thing
                that happened to me. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:31"/> - Really? - Yeah. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:32"/> It made me realize you're the best thing that
                happened to me, with your sexy cat eyes and your cute little hair curl. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:38"/> You look like a soft serve strawberry ice cream. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:42"/> BoJack, we can't. I'm your agent. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:44"/> You are so much more than that. You're my
                lighthouse, my Garmin. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:48"/> You're the little plastic table they put in pizza
                boxes to keep the pizza from getting smushed. </line>
            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:01:52"/> You're Princess Carolyn. </line>
