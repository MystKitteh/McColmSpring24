    <timestamp data-time="00:05:17"/> "Did Sean Penn get convicted of domestic assault or was it
    just alleged? I gotta look that up later." </line>
   <line>

    me, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:25"/> -dumb slob BoJack Horseman?" -That's not-- </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:55"/> Good! Usually at this stage I hate everything I've ever
    written and I feel like a worthless hack, but this book actually isn't terrible. </line>
   <line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:06:19"/> Okay, good bit. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:21"/> In the meantime, if you're interested in writing books that
    people actually read, you'll get to work on "Ivy Tran Two: Last Tran to Clarksville." </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:14"/> I just wanted her to know that I don't have anything to prove

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:14"/> What's that? </line>

    saw. </line>
   <line>

    couldn't get a date to the marshmallow cotillion. </line>

    wine down his face, </line>
   <line>

    now. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:46"/> Yeah, they don't wanna see you be <i>Secretariat</i> or
    raising orphans. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:50"/> But they will see you be a rude dude who says all the things
    polite society is too limp-dicked to say. </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:17:58"/> We spent like 30 bucks on that plant. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:03"/> Yes, I have made mistakes. So, now what? I'm just supposed to
    go away forever? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:08"/> I'm sorry, but that's bullshit. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:10"/> This is where you find out who your real friends are. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:12"/> Part of being sober is leaving behind all the people who can't
    stop seeing you as the person who pissed in the fountain </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:17"/> -at my own daughter's sweet 16. -Yeah? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:19"/> You think you owe them something because they tolerated you at
    your worst, but these people enjoy seeing you fail because it lets them feel superior. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:27"/> They don't know how to process it when you're no longer the
    huge screw-up who hijacked a Meals On Wheels van to bring my friends to a strip club. </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:36"/> You gotta go where the love is. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:38"/> Yeah. Maybe. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:40"/> That's why we gotta make "Horny Unicorn." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:42"/> Because it's gonna make a billion dollars and drive all those
    assholes crazy! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:46"/> It would be good to have something to keep me busy. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:48"/> See? That's what I'm talking about! </line>
   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:55"/> You mind if we swing by EWE.S.C. real quick? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:57"/> EWE.S.C.? I'm trying to keep a low profile. </line>
   <line>

    daughter, okay? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:02"/> She's the one person I care about, the one thing keeping me
    sober. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:05"/> -Why do you need me to go with you? -Unbelievable. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:07"/> When everyone else abandoned you, who was there for you? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:09"/> When the world judged you and ridiculed you? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:11"/> And now, the one time I need something from you... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:13"/> Okay. I'm in. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:15"/> Or as the horny unicorn would say, "Am I in?" </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:19:34"/> -You read my book? -I've been reading it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:36"/> Obviously, I wasn't gonna say it in front of my friends,
    because it's a book for girl babies, but anyways it didn't even make sense! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:41"/> What do you mean? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:42"/> Like, you say the book takes place in Chicago, but Ivy lives
    in Schaumburg. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:46"/> Schaumburg, Diane? Schaumburg's not Chicago. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:49"/> It's in the Chicago metropolitan-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:51"/> Oh, my God, what's next?! Evanston, Chicago? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:55"/> Morton Grove, Chicago? Naperville, Chicago? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:19:59"/> -That's what you sound like! -Okay, it's not too late to
    change it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:03"/> Good. And while you're at it, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:04"/> -I've got some other questions. -Yeah? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:06"/> Like, okay. When Ivy told Moose that he wasn't her best friend
    anymore and Moose said, "You're still <i>my</i> best friend whether you like it or not..."
     <sound noise="sniffs"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:15"/> -was that real? -What do you mean? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:17"/> Like, did that really happen, that someone could be someone's
    best friend still even when they're disappointed in them? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:22"/> Um, yeah, Sonny, that's real. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:25"/> Okay. And you know how Ivy kept her dad's watch in her locker
    because even though he wasn't around she still knew that he loved her? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:33"/> -Was that real, too? -Well, the book is fiction. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:36"/> Yeah, no, I get it, I just... parts of it felt real, you know? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:40"/> Yeah. I know. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:41"/> It's cool that you wrote a book. I mean, I think girls are
    gonna like it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:44"/> Especially girls who, like, don't have good self-esteem. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:47"/> -I hope so. -So, when's the next one coming out? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:49"/> Just in case you need me to check it for other mistakes, you
    know. <sound noise="sniffs"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:53"/> Well, if I get started right away, it should be out by next
    fall. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:20:58"/> -Cool. You gotta flip it. -Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit! </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:08"/> Oh, my God, Dad, is this seriously happening? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:11"/> -Why are you here? -You knew what you were doing when you
    liked your mother's Instagram post of her on the beach with her new boyfriend. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:17"/> -What? -It was a good picture! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:19"/> That's why we're here? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:20"/> Every month, you get five Instagram likes on my account and
    five on your mother's account. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:25"/> You heard what the judge mandated! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:26"/> Hey, man, let's just go. Okay? People are starting to-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:28"/> -Are you BoJack Horseman? -No. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:30"/> -Yeah, you are. -NoJack. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:31"/> Were you trying to get my attention? 'Cause you got it now,
    baby! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:34"/> -Dad! -The story got picked up by TMZ! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:36"/> You're ruining my life! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:37"/> You're making me look like a real cuck, Jagger. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:39"/> I'm getting cucked by my own daughter! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:42"/> You don't even know what that word means! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:44"/> I just want you to know, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:45"/> -I think you got a real bum deal. -Oh, yeah? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:47"/> You got massively sandbagged in that interview, bro. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:49"/> -You were trying to apologize. -Thank you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:53"/> Everything these days is all "patriarchy" this and "male gaze"
    that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:56"/> And, well, I think it's cool you're pushing back against that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:21:59"/> Well, no, I'm not pushing back. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:00"/> No, Bo, I'm saying it's cool. You can relax here. This is a
    safe space. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:05"/> -Okay. -You're embarrassing me! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:07"/> Oh, yeah? How's this for embarrassing? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:09"/> Your last spon-con post for L'Oréal? It came off as
    disingenuous! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:15"/>
    <sound noise="gasps"/> You know I love my wide array of L'Oréal products! </line>
   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:26"/> I think those guys would be super-stoked to meet you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:29"/> -They'd be stoked? -Super-stoked. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:31"/> All right, let's get out of here. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:32"/> My daughter sucks, which is surprising because I did such a
    good job raising her. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:35"/> Let's make one more stop. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:39"/> -Hey! Looking good! -Well, that's politics for you! </line>
