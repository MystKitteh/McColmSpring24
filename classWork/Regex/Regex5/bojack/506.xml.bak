Yes, yes, I see you. Get in. Get in.

Your mother's having another one

of her episodes.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />


Last night, she went to see <i>A Doll's House</i>

with a couple girlfriends,

and now she has ideas.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />


I emerged from my sanctum, this afternoon,

to discover that not only had she

not made me lunch,

which is a meal I need in order to live,

but she'd furthermore, locked herself

in the bedroom to weep... loudly.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />


Now, it's one thing for a woman to weep,

but when they do it at such a volume

you can hear it through the door,

then you know they're doing it

just for the attention.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />


Anyway, I was able to cobble together

a sandwich for myself,

so, I'm the real hero of the story.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />


-<sound noise="horn honking"/>

-<sound noise="tires screeching"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />


It was a couple hours later

when I realized I was on a good run

with my novel.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />


I had this really interesting sentence

that kept going for pages and pages,

and I thought about how rare it is

to really get in the groove like that.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />


How, most days, I can't concentrate

because my idiot child

is blasting the television,

and it suddenly dawned on me;

hot cock on a rock,

she never even picked up

the little noise and snot factory!

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />


<sound noise="tires screech, horn honking"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:26" />


So, here I am, being your mother,

which I know is giving you all sorts

of mixed-up ideas about gender,

while your brain

is still loose and stupid.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />


Just remember,

if you become a queer later in life,

this isn't my fault!

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />


Don't you sing no songs in your nightclub

act called, "My Daddy was My Mommy,"

while gazing longingly

at a tangled string of pearls.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:46" />


Pearls are for ladies, BoJack.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />


Pearls are for ladies.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />


You know Sunday is my writing day.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />


Sundays are the one day

that are just for me and my craft,

and still, you and the black hole

that birthed you

conspire to ruin it for me.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />


What am I supposed to do now?

Just go back to writing?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />


I'm out of the zone now,

the whole day's shot!

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />


All because of you

and that brittle wisp of a woman

you made the mistake

of making your mother.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />


<sound noise="sighs"/> No. It's not her fault.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:15" />


She's doing the best she can, after all.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:17" />


It's just that...

you can't depend on women.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />


You can't depend on anyone.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:22" />


Sooner or later, you need to learn

that no one else

is gonna take care of you.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:25" />


That's what I learned

when I had to make my own sandwich.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:28" />


You can't rely on other people, BoJack.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:30" />


It's good for you to know that.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:32" />


And she's a good mother

for teaching you that.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:34" />


You've got a head start on most kids.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />


You're actually very lucky.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:39" />


<sound noise="music continues over radio"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />


<i>Thaaaaank youuuuu?</i>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />


<sound noise="theme music playing"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />


So, I stopped at a Jack in the Box,

on the way here,

and the girl behind the counter said,

"Hiya! Are you having an awesome day?"

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />


Not, "How are you doing today?"

No. "Are you having an awesome day?"

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />


Which is pretty shitty because it puts

the onus on me to disagree with her,

like if I'm not having an "awesome day,"

suddenly I'm the negative one.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />


Usually, when people ask how I'm doing,

the real answer is I'm doing shitty,

but I can't say I'm doing shitty

because I don't have a good reason

to be doing shitty.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />


So if I say, "I'm doing shitty,"

then they say, "Why? What's wrong?"

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />


And I have to be like,

"I don't know, all of it?"

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />


So instead, when people ask how I'm doing,

I usually say, "I am doing so great."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />


But when this girl at the Jack in the Box

asked me if I was having an awesome day,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />


I thought, well, today

I'm actually allowed to feel shitty,

today I have a good reason,

so I said to her, "Well, my mom died."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />


And she immediately burst into tears.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />


So, now I have to comfort her,

which is annoying,

and meanwhile, there's a line

of people forming behind me,

who are all giving me

these real judgy looks

because I made

the Jack in the Box girl cry.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />


And she's bawling, and she's saying,

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"

and I'm like, "It's fine. It's fine.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />


I mean, it's not fine,

but, you know, it's... fine.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />


And I would like to order

a Double Jack Meal,

and I've kinda got somewhere to be,

so maybe less with the crying

and more with the frying, huh?"

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />


<sound noise="inhales"/> And the girl apologizes, again,

and she offers me a free churro

with my meal.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />


And as I'm leaving,

I think, "I just got a free churro

because my mom died."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />


No one ever tells you when your mom dies,

you get a free churro.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />


<sound noise="people murmuring"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />


<sound noise="clears throat"/> Anyway, I'm sorry,

that's not part of the...

<sound noise="clears throat"/> All right.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />


Okay, here we go. Let's do this.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />


Here I am, BoJack Horseman,

doing a eulogy, let's go.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />


{\an8}Hey, piano man,

can I get like a, like an organ flourish?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />


{\an8}<sound noise="organ plays"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />


{\an8}Nicely done.

You know, I was a little worried

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />


I wouldn't have the right

accompaniment today.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />


{\an8}I guess it's a good thing my mom

was an organ donor!

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />


{\an8}<sound noise="rimshot plays"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />


{\an8}-What happened to the organ?

<sound noise="horn oogahs"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />


Why don't you leave

the comedy to the professionals?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />


{\an8}Okay? This is a funeral, sir,

for my mother.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />


{\an8}Can you show a little respect?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />


<sound noise="trumpet whines"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />


I'll take it.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />


{\an8}Beatrice Horseman, who was she?

What was her deal?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />


Well, she was a horse.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />


{\an8}Uh, she was born in 1938.

She died in 2018.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />


{\an8}One time, she went to a parade,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />


{\an8}and one time, she smoked

an entire cigarette in one long inhale.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />


I watched her do it.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />


{\an8}Truly a remarkable woman.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />


{\an8}<sound noise="rustling"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />


{\an8}Lived a full life, that lady.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />


{\an8}Just, all the way to the end,

which is, uh, now, I guess.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />


{\an8}Really makes you think, though, huh?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />


{\an8}Life, right? Goes by, stuff happens.

Then you die.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />


{\an8}Well, that's my time,

you've been great! Tip your waitress!

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />


{\an8}No, I'm just kidding around,

there's no waitress.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />


{\an8}That's all I have to say about my mother.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />


{\an8}No point beating a dead horse, right?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />


{\an8}So... <sound noise="inhales"/> Now what?

I don't know, Mom, you got any ideas?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />


Anything?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />


Mom?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />


No?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />


Nothing to contribute?

Knock once if you're proud of me.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />


{\an8}Can I just say how amazing it is

to be in a room with my mother,

and I can just talk without her telling me

to shut up and make her a drink?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />


Hey, Mom. Knock once

if you think I should shut up.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />


No? You sure?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />


I mean, I don't want to embarrass you,

by making this eulogy into a me-logy,

so, seriously,

if you wanted me to sit down

and let someone else talk, just knock.

I will not be offended.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />


No? Your funeral.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />


Sorry about the closed casket, by the way.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />


She wanted an open casket,

but, you know, she's dead now,

so who cares what she wanted?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />


No, that sounds bad. I'm sorry.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />


I think that if she could've seen

what she looked like dead,

she'd agree it's better this way.

She looked like this.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />


-<sound noise="groaning"/>

-<sound noise="mourners gasping"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />


Kinda like a pissed-off toy dinosaur.

The coroner couldn't get her eyes closed.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />


So, now her face is forever frozen

in a mask of tremendous horror

and anguish.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />


Or as my mom called it, Tuesday!

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />


Tuesday! My mom called it Tuesday.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />


<sound noise="woman coughs"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />


Hey, Mom, what did you think of that joke?

You like that?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />


<sound noise="woman coughs"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />


You never did care for my comedy.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />


<sound noise="clears throat"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />


Here's a story.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />


When I was a teenager,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />


I performed a comedy routine

for my high school talent show.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />


There was this cool jacket

that I wanted to wear

because it would make me

look like Albert Brooks.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />


For months, I saved up for this jacket,

but when I finally had enough,

I went to the store and it was gone.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />


They had just sold it to someone else.

So, I went home and I told my mother.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />


She said, "Let that be a lesson.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />


That's the good

that comes from wanting things."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />


She was really good

at dispensing life lessons,

that always seemed to circle back

to everything being my fault.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />


But then, on the day of the talent show,

my mother had a surprise for me.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />


She had bought me the jacket.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />


Even though she didn't know how to say it,

I knew this meant that she loved me.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />


Now, that's a good story about my mother.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />


It's not true,

but it's a good story, right?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />


I stole it from an episode of <i>Maude </i>I saw

when i was a kid,

where she talks about her father.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />


I remember when I saw it,

thinking that's the kind of story

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:29" />


I want to tell

about my parents when they die.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />


But I don't have any stories like that.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />


All I know about being good

I learned from TV.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />


And in TV, flawed characters

are constantly showing people they care

with these surprising grand gestures.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />


And I think that part of me

still believes that's what love is.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />


But in real life,

the big gesture isn't enough.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />


You need to be consistent,

you need to be dependably good.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />


You can't just screw everything up,

and then take a boat out into the ocean

to save your best friend,

or solve a mystery, and fly to Kansas.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />


You need to do it every day,

which is so... hard.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />


When you're a kid, you convince yourself

that maybe the grand gesture

could be enough.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />


That even though your parents

aren't what you need them to be,

over and over and over again,

at any moment they might surprise you,

with something... wonderful.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />


I kept waiting for that, the proof,

that even though my mother

was a hard woman,

deep down, she loved me

and cared about me

and wanted me to know

that I made her life

a little bit brighter.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />


Even now, I find myself waiting.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />


Hey, Mom, knock once if you love me

and care about me,

and want me to know I made your life

a little bit brighter.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />


<sound noise="owl chirping"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />


My mother did not go <i>gentle</i>

into that good night.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />


She went clawing and fighting

and thrashing, hence the face.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />


-<sound noise="groaning"/>

-<sound noise="mourners gasping"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />


If you'd seen her,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />


I swear to God the only thing

you'd be thinking about right now

is that I am nailing this impression.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />


-<sound noise="woman clears her throat"/>

-<sound noise="chairs squeak"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />


I was in the hospital with her

those last moments,

and they were truly horrifying,

full of nonsensical screams and cries,

but there was this moment,

this one instant of strange calm,

where she looked in my direction

and said, "I see you."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />


That's the last thing she said to me.

"I see you."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />


Not a statement of judgment

or disappointment, just acceptance

and the simple recognition

of another person in a room.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />


"Hello, there. You are a person.

And I see you."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />


Let me tell you,

it's a weird thing to feel

at 54 years old,

that for the first time in your life

your mother sees you.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />


It's an odd realization that it's

the thing you've been missing,

the only thing you wanted all along,

to be seen.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />


And it doesn't feel like a relief,

to finally be seen.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />


It feels mean, like,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />


"Oh, it turns out that you knew

what I wanted,

and you waited until the very last moment

to give it to me."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />


I was prepared for more cruelty.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />


I was sure that she would get

in one final zinger,

about how I let her down,

and about how I was fat and stupid,

and too tall to be

an effective Lindy-hopper.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />


How I was needy and a burden

and an embarrassment.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />


All that I was ready for.

I was not ready for "I see you."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />


Only my mother would be lousy enough

to swipe me

with a moment of connection

on her way out.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />


But maybe I'm giving her too much credit.

Maybe it wasn't about connection.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />


Maybe it was a... Maybe it was

an "I see you," like, "I see you."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />


Like, "You might have the rest

of the world fooled,

but I know exactly who you are."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />


That's more my mom's speed.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />


Or maybe she just literally meant

"I see you.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />


You are an object

that has entered my field of vision."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />


She was out of it at the end,

so maybe it's dumb

to try to attribute it to anything.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />


-<sound noise="woman sighs"/>

-Back in the 90s,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />


I was in a very famous TV Show

called <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />


-<sound noise="man coughs"/>

-Please hold your applause.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />


And I remember one time, a fan asked me,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />


"Hey, um, you know that episode

where the horse has to give Ethan

a pep talk,

after Ethan finds out his crush

only asked him to the dance

because her friends were having

a dorkiest date contest?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />


In all the shots of the horse,

you can see a paper coffee cup

on the kitchen counter,

but in the shots of Ethan,

the coffee cup's missing.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />


Was that because the show

was making a statement,

about the fluctuant subjectivity of memory

and how even two people

can experience the same moment

in entirely different ways?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />


And I didn't have the heart to be, like,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />


"No, man, some crew guy

just left their coffee cup in the shot."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />


So instead, I was, like... "Yeah."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />


And maybe this is like that coffee cup.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />


Maybe, we're dumb to try to pin

significance onto every little thing.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />


Maybe, when someone says,

"I see you," it just means, "I see you."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />


Then again, it's possible

she wasn't even talking to me.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />


Because, if I'm being honest,

she wasn't really looking at me,

she was looking past me.

There was nobody else in the room.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />


I think she was talking to me,

but, honestly,

she was so far gone at that point,

who knows what she was seeing.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />


Who were you talking to, Mom?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />


<sound noise="sighs"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />


Not saying, huh? Staying mum?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />


No rimshot there?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />


God, whatever I'm paying you,

it's too much.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />


Maybe, she saw my dad.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />


My dad died about ten years ago

of injuries he sustained during a duel.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />


When your father dies,

you ask yourself a lot of questions.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />


Questions like,

"Wait, did you say he died in a duel?"

and "Who dies in a duel?"

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />


The whole thing was so stupid.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />


Dad spent his entire life

writing this book,

but he couldn't get any stores

to carry it,

or any newspapers to review it.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />


Finally, I guess this one newspaper

thought he was pretty hilarious,

because they ran a review

and tore him to shreds.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />


So, my father, ever the Proud Mary,

decided he would not stand

for this besmirchment of his honor.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />


He claimed the critic didn't understand

what it meant to be a man,

so he demanded satisfaction

in the form of pistols at dawn.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />


He wrote the paper, this letter,

saying anyone who didn't like his book,

he would challenge to a duel,

anyone in the world.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />


He'd even pay for airfare

to San Francisco and a night in a hotel.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />


Well, eventually this found its way

to some kook in Montana,

who was as batshit as he was

and took him up on the offer.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />


They met at Golden Gate Park and agreed:

ten paces, then shoot.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />


But in the middle of the ten paces,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />


Dad turned to ask the guy if he'd actually

read the book and what he thought,

but, not looking where he was going,

tripped over an exposed root

and bashed his head on a rock.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />


<sound noise="murmur"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />


I wish I'd known to go

to Jack in the Box then.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />


I could have gotten a free churro.

It would've been nice

to have something to show for being

the son of Butterscotch Horseman.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />


My darling mother gave the eulogy.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />


My entire life I never heard her say

a kind word to or about my father,

but at his funeral she said,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />


"My husband is dead,

and everything is worse now."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />


<sound noise="clearing throat"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />


"My husband is dead,

and everything is worse now."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />


I don't know why she said that.

Maybe she felt that's the kind of thing

you're supposed to say at a funeral.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />


Maybe she hoped one day

someone would say that about her.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:38" />


"My mother is dead,

and everything is worse now."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />


Or maybe she knew

that he had frittered away

all her inheritance,

and replaced it with crippling debt,

which is a pretty shitty thing

to leave your widow with.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />


"Bad news, you lost a husband,

but don't worry, you also lost the house!"

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />


Maybe Mom knew she'd have to sell

all her fancy jewelry

and move into a home.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />


Maybe that's what she meant by

"everything is worse."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />


Is that what you meant, Mom?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />


I gotta say,

I'm really carrying this double act.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />


At least with Penn and Teller,

the quiet one does card tricks.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />


Hey, piano man,

when I say something funny to my mom,

how about you give me a rimshot?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />


-<sound noise="rimshot plays"/>

-Yeah, but not now.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />


When I say something funny. Like, okay.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />


What's the difference between my mother

and a disruptive expulsion of germs?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />


One's a coughin' fit

and the other fits a coffin!

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />


-That's an example of a funny thing.

-<sound noise="rimshot plays"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />


Thank you. Let's try again.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />


Hey, Mom. What's the difference between

my mother and a bunch of Easter eggs?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />


One gets carried in a basket,

the other gets buried in a casket!

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />


-<sound noise="rimshot plays"/>

-Ready for one more? Last one.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />


What's the difference

between a first-year lit major

and my mother, Beatrice Horseman?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />


One is decently read,

and the other's a huge bitch!

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />


-<sound noise="woman gasps"/>

-<sound noise="murmers"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />


Might have gone a little too far

with that one.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />


That one might have been a little too

"my mom's a huge bitch" for the room.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />


I'm sorry, Mother.

You're not a huge bitch.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />


You were a huge bitch...

and now you're dead.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />


<sound noise="woman sighs"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />


You know, the first time I ever performed

in front of an audience,

it actually was, uh, with my mom.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />


She used to put on these shows,

with her supper club in the living room,

and she used to make... <sound noise="inhales"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />


She used to make me sing

"The Lollipop Song."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />


<sound noise="organ playing tune"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />


Those parties, they were really something.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />


There were skits and magic acts,

and ethnically insensitive

vaudeville routines,

and the big finale

was always a dance my mother did.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />


She had this beautiful dress that she only

brought out for these parties,

and she did this incredible number.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:29" />


It was so beautiful and sad.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />


Dad hated the parties.

He'd lock himself in the study,

and bang on the walls

for us to keep it down,

but he always came out to see Mom dance.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />


He'd linger in the doorway,

scotch in hand,

and watch in awe, as this cynical,

despicable woman he married...

took flight.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />


And as a child who was completely

terrified of both my parents,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />


I was always aware

that this moment of grace,

it meant something.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />


We understood each other, in a way.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />


Me and my mom and my dad,

as screwed up as we all were,

we did understand each other.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />


My mother, she knew

what it's like to feel your entire life

like you're drowning

with the exception of these moments,

these very rare, brief instances,

in which you suddenly remember...

you can swim.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />


<sound noise="flashback"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />


<sound noise="partygoers laughing"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />


<sound noise="classical music playing"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />


But, then again, mostly not.

Mostly you're drowning.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />


She understood that too.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />


And she recognized that I understood it.

And Dad.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />


All three of us were drowning,

and we didn't know how to save each other,

but there was an understanding

that we were all drowning together.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />


I would like to think

that's what she meant

when we were in the hospital

and she said, "I see you."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />


The weird thing

about both your parents being dead

is it means that you're next.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />


I mean, you know, obviously it's not

like there's a wait list for dying.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />


Any one of us could get run over

by a Snapchatting teen at any moment.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />


And you would think that knowing that

would make us more adventurous,

and kind, and forgiving.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />


But it makes us small,

and stupid, and petty.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />


I actually had a near-death experience,

recently.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />


A stunt went bad

and I fell off a building.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />


I'm an actor. I do my own stunts.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />


I'm on this new show <i>Philbert.</i>

I'm Philbert. Star of the show.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />


It hasn't come out yet,

but it's already getting Emmy buzz.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />


Oh, speaking of buzz...

<sound noise="inhales"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />


I've to take

two of these every morning,

but my days are so screwed up

'cause of the shooting schedule,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />


I don't even know

what morning means anymore.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />


There's a joke in there somewhere,

about a guy

who's been to so many funerals,

he doesn't even know

what mourning means anymore.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />


Let you guys figure that one out

for yourselves. <sound noise="gulps"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />


Anyway, you know what I thought...

when I was falling off the building

and I went into panic mode?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />


The last thing that my stupid brain

could come up with before I died?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />


"Won't they be sorry."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />


-Cool thought, brain.

-<sound noise="rimshot plays"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />


No, that wasn't...

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />


Would you just... Dial it back, all right?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />


I don't even know what "they"

I wanted to be sorry.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />


My mom, even before she died,

could barely remember who I was.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />


And of course, my dad's dead.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />


The last conversation I ever had with him

was about his novel.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />


He was so certain

this book was his legacy.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />


Maybe he thought it would vindicate him

for all the shitty things he ever did

in his stupid worthless life.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />


Maybe it did. I don't know.

I never read it.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />


Because why would I give him that?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />


I used to be on this TV show

called <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />


Seriously, hold your applause.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />


-<sound noise="man coughs"/>

-Well held.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />


It was written by my friend Herb Kazzaz,

who's also dead now,

and it starred this little girl

named Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />


And it was about these orphans.

And early on, the network had a note,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />


"Maybe don't mention

they're orphans,

because audiences tend

to find orphans sad and not relatable."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />


I never thought the orphans were sad.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />


I always thought they were lucky

because they could imagine their parents

to be anything they wanted.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />


They had something to long for.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />


Anyway, we did this one season finale,

where Olivia's birth mother comes to town.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />


And she was a junkie,

but she's gotten herself cleaned up,

and she wants to be

in Olivia's life again.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />


And of course, she's like a perfect

grown-up version of Olivia,

and they go to the mall together

and get her ears pierced,

like she's always wanted and--

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />


Sorry, spoiler alert for the season six

finale of <i>Horsin' Around,</i>

if you're still working

your way through it.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />


Anyway, the horse tries

to warn her, "Be careful,

moms have a way of letting you down."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />


But Olivia just thinks

the horse is jealous,

and when the mom says

she's moving to California,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />


Olivia decides to go with her.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />


And the network really juiced

the cliffhanger:

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />


''Is Olivia gone for good?''

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />


But of course, because it's a TV show,

she was not gone for good.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />


Of course, because it's a TV show,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />


Olivia's mother had a relapse

and had to go back to rehab,

so Olivia had to hitchhike

all the way home,

getting rides from Mr. T,

Alf, and the cast of <i>Stomp.</i>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />


Of course that's what happened.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />


Because, what are you gonna do,

just not have Olivia on the show?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />


You can't have happy endings in sitcoms,

not really,

because, if everyone's happy,

the show would be over,

and above all else,

the show... has to keep going.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />


There's always more show.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />


And you can call <i>Horsin' Around </i>dumb,

or bad, or unrealistic,

but there is nothing more realistic

than that.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />


You never get a happy ending,

'cause there's always more show.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />


I guess until there isn't.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />


<sound noise="chuckles"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />


My mom would hate it if she knew

that I spent so much time at her funeral

talking about my old TV show.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />


Or maybe she'd think it was funny

that her idiot son

couldn't even do this right. Who knows?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />


She left no instructions

for what she wanted me to say.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />


All I know is she wanted an open casket,

and her idiot son

couldn't even do that right.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />


I'll stand up here and pretend

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />


I understood

how to please that woman,

even though so much of my life has been

wasted in vain attempts to figure it out.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />


But I keep going back to that moment

in the ICU when she looked at me, and...

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />


"I-C-U."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />


"I... see... you."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />


Jesus Christ,

we were in the intensive care unit.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />


She was just reading a sign.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />


My mom died and all I got

was this free churro.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />


You know the shittiest thing

about all of this?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />


Is when that stranger behind the counter

gave me that free churro,

that small act of kindness

showed more compassion

than my mother gave me

her entire goddamn life.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />


Like, how hard is it to do something nice

for a person?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />


This woman at the Jack in the Box

didn't even know me.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />


I'm your son.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />


All I had was you!

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />


<sound noise="inhales"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />


I have this friend.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />


And right around when I first met her,

her dad died, and I actually went with her

to the funeral.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />


And months later, she told me

that she didn't understand

why she was still upset,

because she never even liked her father.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />


It made sense to me, because I went

through the same thing when my dad died.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />


And I'm going through the same thing now.

You know what it's like?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />


It's like that show <i>Becker,</i>

you know, with Ted Danson?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />


I watched the entire run of it,

hoping that it would get better,

and it never did.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />


It had all the right pieces, but it just--

It couldn't put them together.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />


And when it got canceled,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />


I was really bummed out,

not because I liked the show,

but because I knew it could be

so much better,

and now it never would be.

And that's what losing a parent is like.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />


It's like <i>Becker.</i>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />


Suddenly, you realize you'll never have

the good relationship you wanted,

and as long as they were alive,

even though you'd never admit it,

part of you,

the stupidest goddamn part of you,

was still holding on to that chance.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />


And you didn't even realize it

until that chance went away.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />


"My mother is dead,

and everything is worse now."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />


Because now I know

I will never have a mother

who looks at me from across a room

and says,

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />


"BoJack Horseman, I see you."

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />


But I guess it's good to know.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />


It's good to know

that there is nobody looking out for me,

that there never was,

and there never will be.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />


No, it's good to know that I am

the only one that I can depend on.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />


And I know that now and it's good.

It's good that I know that.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />


So... it's good my mother is dead.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />


<sound noise="gulps, sighs"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />


Well. No point beating a dead horse.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />


Beatrice Horseman was born in 1938,

and she died in 2018,

and I have no idea... what she wanted.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:23" />


Unless she just wanted what we all want...

to be seen.

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:42" />


<sound noise="slurps"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:43" />


<sound noise="blows nose"/>

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:45" />


Is this Funeral Parlor B?

</line>
<line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:47" />


<sound noise="funeral music"/>
