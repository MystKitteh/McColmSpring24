    <i>What does that mean?</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:09"/> Crooshness is hard to define, but I also don't know it when I
    see it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:12"/> Oop. Pardon my reach. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:13"/> Well, I'm always trying to get more girls interested in
    agriculture. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:16"/> You might say I've got my eyes on them. Potato eyes, that is. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:21"/> -Guy? -<sound noise="Guy"/> Mm-hmm. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:22"/> Hey, girls! It's Diane, outside Idaho's largest potato
    supplier, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:26"/> -Starch Farms. -Hello! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:28"/> Let me get this straight. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:29"/> Your farm harvests five types of potatoes, two types of
    onions, and is also a front for a local sex trafficking ring? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:35"/> -<sound noise="gasps"/> -How'd you get started in sex
    trafficking? </line>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:53" sub="{\an8}" /><i>It's like the Tom Hanks</i>

    to when I have to scratch my nose? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:05"/> I thought scratching your nose was your way of saying hello to
    me. </line>
   <line>

    not huge campaign donors, ergo-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:24"/> No, the mayor didn't target that neighborhood, he was just
    that stupid when it came to water filtration. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:29"/> He was just stupid enough to think he wouldn't get caught,
    ergo-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:32"/> Say "ergo" one more time. </line>
   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:52"/> Oh, shit. Well, how many companies are there now? </line>
   <line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:02:01"/> -Huh. -I mean, this is unprofessional. One bed! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:04"/> What are we supposed to do with just one bed? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:06"/> Quite a pickle. </line>

    <i>Rehab is making me write a letter</i>

    <i>to a friend</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:19"/>


    <i>because I guess letter writing</i>

    <i>is therapeutic?</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:21"/>


    <i>I hear it did wonders</i>

    <i>for the Zodiac killer.</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:24"/>


    <i>Anyway, rehab's going fine.</i>

    <i>A lot of hikes and movie nights and yoga,</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:28"/>


    <i>and I think next week,</i>

    <i>we're doing a color war.</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:32"/>


    <i>And it's good that I'm here,</i>

    <i>and it's good that I'm not drinking</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:35"/>


    <i>or taking pills, but I keep thinking</i>

    <i>about how this isn't real life.</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:38"/>


    <i>It's summer camp. Temporary. Easy.</i>

   </line>
   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:48"/> I don't care if he doesn't wanna talk to me. I'm his father.
    No, Lady-- </line>

    Whitewhale setting up shop in your hometown. </line>
   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:09"/> I am adoring your cross-country exposition of the ugly
    underbelly of American capitalism. </line>
   <line>

   <line>

   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:32"/> What about that girl who opened up a lemonade stand to pay for
    her dad's cancer treatment? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:35"/> How is that a feel-good story? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:37"/> "Hey, America! We're the only developed nation without
    subsidized healthcare, so this child joined the workforce in a desperate bid to keep her father
    alive!" </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:44"/> Okay. How 'bout this? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:45" sub="{\an8}" />Local cameraman has a pretty good thing going, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:48" sub="{\an8}" />where he gets to travel all over the country </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:49" sub="{\an8}" />and fool around in hotel rooms with his beautiful,
    smart, feisty producer... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:53" sub="{\an8}" />and he's pretty sure this passionate, intelligent,
    warrior for truth likes it too, so maybe these two knuckleheads should swallow their pride for a
    second and make some feel-good videos. </line>
   <line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:06:11"/> Tell me about the Every Animal Girl Company. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:14"/> We are two best friends who got tired of seeing dolls
    promoting unrealistic beauty standards. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:19"/> Take Ginny here. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:20"/> Most giraffe dolls have necks one inch shorter by scale than
    the average girl giraffe. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:24"/> Not our Ginny. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:25"/> Her neck is long and proud, for all our necky gals out there. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:30"/> As a necky gal, I love that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:32"/> And is it true that all your dolls are made out of recycled
    material? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:35"/> -Uh... No. -Yes! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:36"/> -Sorry? -Well, traditionally... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:38"/> -<sound noise="overlapping dialogue"/> -The first batch, um... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:41"/> The important thing is we're two best friends. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:44"/> Okay, what's going on? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:45"/> Uh... <sound noise="giggles nervously"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:47"/> Okay. We are excited to announce that as of today, the Every
    Animal Girl Company has been purchased by Toys Galore, a subsidiary of Whitewhale Consolidated
    Interests. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:57"/> Yay! Toys Galore! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:59"/> -Uh... -Huh? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:01"/> "Yay..." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:03"/> A small, independent start-up bought out by a huge
    conglomerate. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:06"/> It must be so empowering to see your success grow. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:10"/> What a happy story for two best friends. Now, about the
    recycled materials? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:14"/> Well, it's unclear what role recycling will play in the future
    of this company. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:17"/> Right now, we're mainly focused on empowering young girls and
    closing the main Chicago factory so we can relocate overseas for cheaper labor. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:25"/> Right before the holidays! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:27"/>
    <sound noise="clears throat"/> Feel-good. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:29"/>
    <sound noise="strained"/> What an exciting, empowering time for you! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:32"/> I know. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:35"/> You think you can edit that down into something feel-goody? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:37"/> For sure. It'll have to go up late, though, because I'm having
    some friends over to watch the game tonight. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:42"/> God, I'm freezing. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:45"/> -Aw. -So, you, uh... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:47"/> -You wanna watch the game with us? -Are you asking me to meet
    your friends? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:50"/> No, I just figure, since you're staying with me anyway-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:53"/> I would be delighted. Wait, it's not the Chicago Baby Humans
    game, is it? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:56"/> It's just a mascot. </line>
