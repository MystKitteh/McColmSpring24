    <timestamp data-time="00:00:09"/> In my line of work, I meet a lot of big names. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:11"/> I'm talking the sexiest guys of the '90s: Nick Nolte. Mickey
    Rourke... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:15"/> Literally, here we are in the '90s, and these are the guys we
    think are sexy, right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:19"/> And my daughter couldn't care less. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:21"/> But when I told her I was meeting BoJack Horseman... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:24"/> Do me a favor. Make her day. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:26"/>


    <sound noise="sighs"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:27"/> Me? I didn't ask for this gig. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:29"/> Angela Diaz, head of the network, calls me, working schmuck,
    Danny Bananas, and says, "Danny, Herb Kazzaz is leavin', and I want you to run <i>Horsin'
     Around.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:39"/> So, here's me, thinking, "What an opportunity to write for the
    most finely-calibrated ensemble cast on television!" </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:44"/> It's like a bowling alley with you people. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:46"/> Setting up pins and knocking them down. I should be so lucky. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:49"/> -Uh. -I know it's no secret that you and Herb had some
    friction, and he left the show under not-great circumstances. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:55"/> Now I'm coming at this from a place of... this is your house,
    and I'm a guest, all right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:00"/> The magic of <i>Horsin' Around</i> is not Herb Kazzaz or Danny
    Bananas. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:03"/> I know why people buy the Big Mac. I'm not here to change the
    recipe. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:07"/> You're the special sauce, BoJack. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:09"/> Me? I just wanna be the bun. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:11"/> And not even the top or the bottom bun. I'm fine being the
    middle bun. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:14"/> -You already told me this story. -I did? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:16"/> Yeah. Danny. Sharona. The buns. We've been over it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:20"/> -Well, did I tell you about Gina? -Yes. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:22"/> -And Sarah Lynn? -Multiple times. Yes. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:25"/> -What about the time I sneezed on Marisa? -You've told me
    everything. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:28"/> You told me about that dream where you go to a dinner party. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:30"/> I even went down that strange detour with you about the
    three-nippled woman in the nudie magazine your uncle showed you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:35"/> -Who was she? -I think we're done here. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:38"/> -What do you mean, done? -Well, you've been here six months. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:41"/> It's time to go home. </line>

    <sound noise="Shannon"/> Oh, sorry. Uh, not this way. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:40" sub="{\an8}" />My boss is gonna kill me if I don't deliver these
    flowers to his mistress. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:44"/> Well, we're filming an episode of <i>Birthday Dad,</i> and my
    boss is gonna kill me if I let anyone through. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:50" sub="{\an8}" />Great, when they discover my remains scattered in the
    bramble of Griffith Park, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:53" sub="{\an8}" />my loved ones will take solace knowing I died </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:56" sub="{\an8}" />so they could shoot an episode of <i>Birthday Dad.</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:58"/> I'm sorry. It's a really good show! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:03" sub="{\an8}" />I know I couldn't always be there for you,
    birthday-wise, but I'd like to be. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:09" sub="{\an8}" />I'd like to be your Birthday Dad. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:11" sub="{\an8}" />You really don't get it, do you? This is the real world,
    okay? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:15" sub="{\an8}" />And I'm a career gal. I don't have time for birthdays. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:18" sub="{\an8}" />But what about the birthday spirit? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:20" sub="{\an8}" />Everyone knows there's no such thing. This is the real
    world. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:23" sub="{\an8}" />Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to drink my coffee. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:26" sub="{\an8}" />-Cut. Let's move on. -<sound noise="bell rings"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:28" sub="{\an8}" />Great take, Melodie. Chills. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:30" sub="{\an8}" />Are we Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, Kevin Kline, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:33" sub="{\an8}" />and all of the greatest Motown singles collected on
    one... </line>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:37" sub="{\an8}" />-<sound noise="chuckles"/> "Big Chills." -Hot herbal
    tea? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:39" sub="{\an8}" />-Yes, that would be-- Ooh! -Ha! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:41" sub="{\an8}" />-Oops. -<sound noise="chuckles"/> Got me again, Audrey. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:43" sub="{\an8}" />Donna, we're gonna need another scarf. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:45" sub="{\an8}" />Am I crazy, or has the crew turned on you? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:47"/> No, what they're turned onto is hating me... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:50" sub="{\an8}" />on account of I cheated on Pickles. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:52" sub="{\an8}" />Ever since the story went viral, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:53" sub="{\an8}" />the public has really mashed the thumbs down on old
    Peanurino. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:57" sub="{\an8}" />-Especially young women. -Oh, no! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:59" sub="{\an8}" />"Especially young women" is one of our show's eight
    target demos. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:02"/> We gotta juice your Q! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:04"/> Right now, the only juice I'm interested in is Pickles' juice </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:07" sub="{\an8}" />and making things kosher between us, which is a task I
    relish. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:11"/> -So, you wanna have sex with me? -Yes. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:13"/> And your fianc√© is gonna be in there watching, or... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:15"/> Oh, no. Sorry for the misunderstanding. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:17"/> This is not a fetish-based cuckolding scenario. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:20"/> He had sex with his ex, so to level the playing field now, we
    have to boink, so Mister and I can be even and everything can go back to normal. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:26"/> You understand? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:27"/> Not really, but I get to have sex with you? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:29"/> -Yeah. -Correct. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:30"/> Then, cool. I'm in. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:32"/> -But what about your reputation? -I'm not too worried about
    it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:35"/> I feel like people generally want to like me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:38"/> And if I just don't do anything, eventually, the universe will
    realign and the public will go back to loving me again. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:44"/> -<sound noise="grunts"/> -Ugh. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:48"/> -Mm, thanks for making breakfast. -Thanks for calling it
    breakfast. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:51"/> Not everyone appreciates the subtle art of the crispy oatmeal. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:54"/> -Are you starting your memoir today? -That was the plan. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:57"/> But I got these dishes now. That'll take all morning. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:59"/> And once the morning's over, basically the whole day is shot,
    you know? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:02"/> Better to start clean tomorrow. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:03"/> Look, I know it's hard to start a new thing, but the hardest
    part is starting. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:08"/> You're right. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:09"/> Also, I'm a freelance cameraman who pays child support, so I'd
    encourage you to get an advance. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:14"/> Hmm. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:15"/>


    <sound noise="indistinct chattering"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:18"/> Hey, uh, guys? Uh, excuse me, everyone? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:20"/> I just wanted to raise a non-alcoholic toast to Denise. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:24"/> -<sound noise="laughter"/> -Ha-ha! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:26"/>
    <sound noise="man"/> Ow! My gluten intolerance! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:28"/> We've all been through so much together, and it's never easy
    to say goodbye. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:32"/> -Remember when Doug left? -<sound noise="all"/> Hmm? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:34"/> -Or Jameson? -<sound noise="all muttering"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:36"/> Or sweet, sweet Bongo? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:37"/> -Sorry, who are we talking about? -To Denise! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:40"/>
    <sound noise="all"/> Denise! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:41"/>


    <sound noise="man laughs"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:43"/> I didn't realize we're the last of our original group. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:45"/> -God, we had some good times, huh? -I mean, no, mostly. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:49"/> -Yeah. But you're ready, right? -Ready or not, here I go. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:53"/> Yeah, you're ready. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:54"/> Have you given any thought to what we discussed yesterday? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:57"/> About you transitioning to a version of yourself that is no
    longer here? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:00"/> I don't know. Things are kinda working for me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:02"/> Staying out of trouble, got the fancy room, finally perfected
    my egg-white omelet order. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:06"/> The secret is egg yellows. I might do another six weeks. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:09"/>
    <sound noise="chuckles"/> You've already re-upped three times. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:11"/> This place is for people in crisis. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:13"/> In crisis of being too cool, maybe. Right, Karmen? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:16"/> -I-If I say yes, I can see my baby? -Karmen, no. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:21"/> You sold your baby to a den of leeches to pay for crack. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:23"/> -The leeches have your baby now. -Oh, yeah. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:27"/> Ah. Classic Karm. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:28"/> It's natural to be hesitant. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:30"/> When I first checked out of rehab, I was terrified. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:33"/> I knew a single drop of alcohol would send me down a ruinous
    path. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:37"/> -But I found my way. -Found your way back to rehab. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:39"/> -Ah, I'll miss our little comedy routines. -"Our"? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:42"/> A lot of people leave this place, and I think, "They're not
    gonna make it." Like Denise, for example. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:48"/> But you? You've done the work, and you're ready. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:51"/> You're a special case, BoJack. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:53"/> -I am? -Of course you are. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:58"/> Huh. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:59"/>


    <sound noise="Sharona"/>
    <i> Oh, boy,</i>

    <i>did he do a number on you.</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:04"/> He was actually very nice. You know, I want things to be easy
    on set. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:07"/> And I think Danny represents a fresh start. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:09"/> -Is that why you got Herb fired? -Hey, I'm not the one who-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:12"/> I can't do your hair if you're gonna move your head so much. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:15"/> There was nothing I could do about Herb. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:16"/> If it wasn't for me, they would've canceled the whole show. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:19"/> And then where would you go? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:20"/> Who's gonna hire a hair-and-makeup lady with shaky hands? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:22"/> -My hands only shake when I don't drink. -Be sure to put that
    on your r√©sum√©. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:26"/> You're just bitter because I'm the only person who can drink
    as much as you do. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:36"/> -<sound noise="giggles"/> -Ruthie! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:37"/> -Here comes the airplane... -<sound noise="tires screech"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:39"/> -<sound noise="car crashes"/> -Oh, a kerfuffle! </line>

    <sound noise="people clamoring"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:43"/> Hey! What's going on out there? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:45"/> An ice cream truck crashed into the root beer factory! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:48"/> Oh, sounds like a delicious disaster. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:51"/> -Five people are dead! -Oh, no! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:54"/> And there's worse to come, unless somebody can slurp up all
    that ice cream! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:59"/> Oh, I'd love to help slurp, but I just started a new nannying
    job. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:04"/> I don't care! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:06"/> Hmm... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:11"/> Wow, BoJack leaving rehab. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:14"/> -Truly the end of an era. -<sound noise="crying"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:16"/> Sobby Bobby. Gonna miss your excessive crying. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:19"/> Can't believe it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:20"/> Last time I'm gonna stop at this vending machine. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:23"/> What do you say, B-7? One more hike down Funyun Canyon? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:28"/>
    <sound noise="inhales"/> Whew. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:32"/> Oh, wow. Hello, the public. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:35"/> Didn't think I'd have to address this so quickly, but I am not
    ashamed. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:37"/> -Yes, I, BoJack Horseman, went to rehab-- -Uh, keep it moving. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:41"/> We wanna get a clean shot for when Gen Z pop superstar/fashion
    disrupter Joey Pogo shows up. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:48"/> -Joey Pogo? -Yeah, he's checking in today. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:50"/> -We heard he's gettin' the fancy room. -Fancy room? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:54"/> He's gettin' the fancy room. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:57"/> -It's time to go home. -What? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:00"/> Ready or not. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:01"/> I got the fancy room. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:04"/> He's gettin' the fancy room. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:07"/> You're a special case, BoJack. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:10"/> Stay cool, man. Have a good summer. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:13"/> What does it all mean? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:15"/> Sounds like they're kicking you out to make room for Joey
    Pogo. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:17"/> Huh? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:18"/> Sounds like they're kicking you out to make room for Joey
    Pogo. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:23"/> Oh, my God. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:24"/> I think they're kicking me out to make room for Joey Pogo. </line>
