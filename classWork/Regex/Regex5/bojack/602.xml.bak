   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:36"/> Okay, so your fiancée. Let's say her name is... Pickles. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:40"/> -Wait, uh... -She doesn't know, and she's happy not knowing. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:42"/> Wouldn't telling her now just cause additional pain? </line>
   <line>

    her? </line>

   <line>

    the best option just happens to be the one where he doesn't get in trouble! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:57"/> -Mr. Peanutbutter-- -But that's just Doug all over, isn't it? </line>

    bottle up your guilt, not burden other people with it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:30"/> -Yeah? -You think you're protecting them from your toxicity,
    you convince yourself that you're being selfless, but... it comes out in other ways and it
