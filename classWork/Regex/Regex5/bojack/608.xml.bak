   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:11"/> A hummingbird smiled at me on my walk this morning. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:15"/> In small pleasures such as this, I'm reminded of the presence
    of the Lord. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:19"/> -As you ought. -And yet... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:22"/> -No. -Out with it, Sister Marguerite. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:24"/> To hesitate is to waste time, which is a sin when time could
    be elsewise spent in prayer, or handwashing Monsignor Toscani's 1962 Alfa Romeo, which is itself
    a form of prayer, is it not? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:36"/> Of course. Yet I find myself consumed by thoughts of my past. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:41"/> You have no past. You've confessed. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:43"/> Your sins have been washed clean. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:45"/> This is like day one stuff, what are we talking about here? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:48"/> The people I've hurt, the lives I've ruined, are they washed
    clean as well? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:55"/> Your regrets are of no benefit to the Lord. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:00:57"/> Ruminating so is a solipsism unbefitting a sister of the
    cloth. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:01"/> Is it solipsism to be concerned with the fates of others? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:05"/> Perhaps one could argue cloistering oneself from the world is
    itself a form of solipsism. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:10"/>
    <sound noise="stammers"/> If one were being ungenerous. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:12"/> Remember when you first arrived here and you didn't talk for
    like two years? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:17"/> I will trouble you no further, Mother. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:01:19"/> Lord, how you challenge me with so vexing a pupil. </line>
   <line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:01:26"/> When you get to Heaven, look up Margo Martindale! </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:30" sub="{\an8}" />I wanna know what's changed since the strike. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:32"/> Are assistants treated better or have things reverted to
    business as usual? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:35" sub="{\an8}" />Yeah, give me ten inches. I also want a roast beef sub. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:38" sub="{\an8}" />-Six inches. -<sound noise="intercom beeps"/>

    <i>Paige Sinclair is on her way up.</i> -Ah, shit. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:42"/> She's the best reporter this building's ever seen, but,
    goddamn, is that woman a pain in the ass. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:46"/>
    <sound noise="Paige"/> Colleagues! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:48"/> Your eyes do not deceive! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:49"/> You may find my gown overly formal for the workplace, but that
    is because I am, as of today formerly a member of this vaulted institution. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:55"/> As I'm to be wed tonight and the newsroom is no room for a
    domesticated woman, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:02:59"/> -I bid you farewell. -<sound noise="man screams"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:01"/> Okay, goodbye. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:02"/> Yes, mine was a storied run as the star reporter for "The
    Reporter." </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:05"/> "Front Page Paige," they called me! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:07"/> -Well, we'll miss you, Paige. -Indeed. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:09"/> My shoes don't fill easy, my left foot striking a more robust
    silhouette than her starboard sister. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:13" sub="{\an8}" />But I cannot prolong my engagement. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:15" sub="{\an8}" />After all, time, as they say, is a river without banks. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:18" sub="{\an8}" />Time may not have banks, but this periodical certainly
    does. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:21"/> Maximillian Banks, at my service! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:23"/>
    <sound noise="scoffs"/> Maximilian Banks. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:25" sub="{\an8}" />I may lack your nose for news, but I've got an eyeball
    for a highball! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:29" sub="{\an8}" />Why, this man couldn't string together two clauses </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:31" sub="{\an8}" />without ending on a preposition. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:33" sub="{\an8}" />I don't know what you're referring to. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:34"/> You could fill a library with all the things you don't know. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:36"/> In fact, they do. They call them libraries. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:40"/> Guys, we're trying to work here. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:41"/> No matter, I shan't be staying. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:43"/> My sweet betrothed, Baxter Bellamy, awaits with champagne to
    chauffeur me directly to my nuptials, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:47" sub="{\an8}" />and I didn't think I'd visit long, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:48" sub="{\an8}" />so I left him in the car with the windows up. <sound
     noise="chuckles"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:51"/> Good, I've got business to attend to as well. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:53" sub="{\an8}" />I'll have you know it's almost time for my mid-morning
    confabulation </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:03:57" sub="{\an8}" />with a former stage mother to the stars, Mrs. Carol
    Himmelfarb-Richardson. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:01"/> You've been taking those phone calls?! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:03"/> Yes, she is as loony as a Canadian dollar, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:06" sub="{\an8}" />but she is a scintillating conversationalist. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:09"/> Oh? What about the conversation scintillates? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:12"/> She calls every day to see if we have any information on her
    dead daughter. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:15"/> -The answer's always no. -Sounds like a scoop. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:17"/> It's not. It's a pop star who overdosed. Open-and-shut case. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:20"/> -All the better for opening and shutting. -Why do you have
    that? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:23" sub="{\an8}" />Baxter, my boy, my dear sweet beautiful bridegroom, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:27" sub="{\an8}" />best put the champagne on ice. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:28"/> I've got a story that simply demands my attention and I just
    couldn't marry you before it's settled. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:32" sub="{\an8}" />I'd only be distracted, which isn't fair to you or me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:35" sub="{\an8}" />Oh, darling, I've already committed to being your wife. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:38"/> What, you need to hear a few measly words? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:40"/> Well, "I do." Does that satisfy? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:41"/> I do, I do, I do, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:43" sub="{\an8}" />and I do want you to wait for me to ring you again
    shortly. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:46" sub="{\an8}" /><sound noise="snorts"/> I knew you'd understand. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:49"/> Oh. Mm! <sound noise="snorts"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:51"/> Now, as to the girl. I smell beans. Spill 'em. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:54"/> The girl's name was Sharon Lynn. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:57" sub="{\an8}" />It's Sarah Lynn. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:04:59" sub="{\an8}" />Hmm... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:01"/>


    <i>♪ Don't you touch my prickly muffin ♪</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:06" sub="{\an8}" />Did you ever notice that this music video takes place in
    a planetarium, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:10" sub="{\an8}" />-and Sarah Lynn died in a planetarium? -Huh. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:13"/> -Uh... Hey, Tawnie. -<sound noise="music stops"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:15"/> Are we going to this party? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:16"/> I didn't come all the way down to Manhattan to just watch you
    watch your boyfriend be on the internet at his parents' fancy house. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:22" sub="{\an8}" />Don't parent-shame him, Hollyhock. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:24" sub="{\an8}" />It's not Trey's fault he grew up in an Upper Westside
    brownstone. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:27" sub="{\an8}" />Also, I'm not her boyfriend. We're uncomplicated like
    that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:31"/> Come on! We're missing the party. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:33" sub="{\an8}" />What? No. If we show up before 2:00, everyone's gonna
    think we're losers. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:37"/> Fine. But can't we do something else while we wait? <sound
     noise="gasps"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:41"/> Let's explore the city! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:45"/> -<sound noise="sighs"/> -<sound noise="siren wailing"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:47"/> The Big Apple. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:50"/> There she is. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:52"/> Apparently, there's a bar around here called Hartigan's. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:55"/> My cousin and his friends call it "They-Don't-Cardigan's." I
    don't get it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:05:59"/> Wow, a real New York bar. That could be cool. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:02"/> Yeah, a bar! But how often are we in New York? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:07"/> Let's go to the top of the Empire State Building, like the big
    ape in that movie, <i>Sleepless in Seattle!</i>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:12"/> All right! Big building! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:13"/>


    <sound noise="thunder rumbling"/>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:19"/> Lord, we thank You for this bounty-- Ella? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:22"/> That place you sent me didn't fix me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:24"/> Because I am not a thing to be fixed, Daddy. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:27"/> Have a seat. We're havin' bacon-blasted chicken fingers from
    Chicken-4-Dayz. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:31"/> I'm not staying. I'm going to a place where the people accept
    me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:35"/> You sit your ass in that chair, Ella, because that place is
    right here. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:39"/> Oh, Daddy! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:41"/> That's what I wish I'd said. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:42"/> I haven't seen Ella in four years, but every night I bring
    home dinner, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:46"/> I get an extra bucket of bacon-blasted chicken fingers just
    for her, so that if she ever comes home... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:50"/>


    <i>she'll know that she's welcome</i>

    <i>at our table.</i>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:53"/> Huh? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:54"/> Kelsey Jannings, our little indie film darling, </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:06:58"/> I think I speak for both of us when I say gooba, gooba, hey,
    yah, yah! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:02"/> Tears. Feel my cheeks. Damp cheeks over here. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:05"/> I do notice it's not as Chicken-4-Dayz-focused as maybe it
    seemed in the outline stage? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:10"/> Talk us through your journey there. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:11"/> What do you want? You want a close-up of the bucket? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:14"/> Ooh, I think that would make it feel like a commercial, and
    what's so innovative about this content is that it's not a commercial. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:20"/> Right, I forgot about the innovative part of it. Excuse me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:23"/> Our target demo responds poorly when they feel they're being
    advertised to, but they love stories that engage them on their level, utilizing themes of
    inclusivity, as well as dunking on the olds. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:34"/> Ah, yes, teens love dunking on olds, is there any way to get
    more of that in? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:39"/> -Well, we already shot the ad. -Not an ad. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:41"/> The immersive product placement journey. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:43"/> But maybe I can find takes that are in more of a dunking tone,
    as well as shots that highlight more prominently but do not feature the bucket of chicken-bacon
    finger-blasters. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:52"/> Thank you for letting us help you share your beautiful vision
    with the world. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:07:56"/> No. Thank you. </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:03"/> A gig's a gig. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:04"/> And Vassar doesn't accept indie cred in lieu of my daughter's
    tuition. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:07"/> I just don't believe it. You're a way better director than I
    am. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:10"/> If you'd told me that one day you'd be doing chicken
    commercials-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:14"/> -Not a commercial. -That you'd be doing sponsored content
    pre-roll for <i>Beverly Hillbillies </i>reruns on Gronkle while I'm directing another
    action-adventure blockbuster, this one set in the world of competitive ballroom dancing, working
    title, "Balls to the Wall," if you'd told me that... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:29"/> You'd be super-stoked? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:30"/> Yeah, first, I'd be really stoked, but then eventually, I
    would get around to being outraged. </line>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:38"/> It is fun that we're both working on the same lot, though. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:41"/> -Right? -Yeah. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:42"/> -<sound noise="cell phone buzzing"/> -Sorry. </line>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:47"/> Again? Okay. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:48"/> -Yeah. I'll talk to her. -<sound noise="phone beeps"/>
   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:51"/> What are these new pages? Why do I have new pages? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:54"/> You don't like the new pages? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:55"/>
    <sound noise="groans"/> The content of the pages is not the issue, Justin. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:08:58"/> -Yeah. -I spent time preparing the other pages. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:00"/> You understand? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:01"/> I rehearsed them. I studied them. That's precious time I'll
    never get back! </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:04"/> And then some person-- I don't know this person-- </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:07"/> And by the way, I don't like strange persons knocking on my
    door and then letting themselves in. The knock is so I can tell you to enter. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:13"/> If you just enter, what is the purpose of the knock? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:15"/> You're right, of course. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:16"/> My point is about the pages. Why are you throwing new things
    at me? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:20"/> The insurance guys are nixing the car chase. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:22"/> We had to think fast, so we put together a new hand-to-hand
    combat scene we're gonna throw on top of the meringue number. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:27"/> -So, it's a stunt? -I thought you'd be excited. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:29"/> I'm excited! It's more time spent on your face. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:33"/> Ever since I directed you in that episode of "FBI: Female Body
    Inspectors," </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:09:36"/> I thought... <sound noise="chuckles"/> "I gotta give this

   <line>

   <line>

    you, as a woman, to tell them their take. </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:28"/>
    <sound noise="man"/> I've been saying for years as soon as we run out of popular male characters

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:38"/> Outside is exactly where we're trying to be, in relation to
    the box. </line>
   <line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:14:52"/> Didn't I tell you this would make a great movie? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:54"/> Uh, pretty sure I told you, Nancy. I have always loved
    Fireflame. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:14:58"/> I'm sorry. I remember now, you did tell me that. </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:58"/> Sounds good. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:15:59"/> In the meantime, someone in this building might just offer the
    key that opens the gate to the garden with the tree that bears the fruit that is our scoop. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:06"/> Get someone to squeal on an AA meeting? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:07"/> I do believe one "A" of the two stands for "anonymous." </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:16:11"/> The other "A", I could not possibly fathom. </line>
   <line>

    on celebrities so as to appear swank by association. </line>
   <line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:47"/> About a month before she died. It was pretty clear she was

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:50"/> Well, how do you figure? Did she say something? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:52"/> She didn't, but her friend did. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:55"/> -Her friend? -Large fella. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:16:56"/> I think he was a horse or a bull maybe, it's hard to remember. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:00"/> Kind of like a rounder Brad Garrett type, but with a very
    forgettable face. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:04"/> He told a story, though, I remember that. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:06"/> It was about a trip he took to... New Mexico. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:10"/> -Oh? -Yeah, it was about a girl and a mother. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:13"/> Oh, this is so long ago now. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:15"/> I think he had sex with the girl, or maybe he had sex with the
    mother? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:19"/> Well, do get your story sorted, but I'd prefer it if it's
    sordid. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:23"/> And this man left with Sarah Lynn? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:25"/> Do you recall anything else about this man, his name, perhaps? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:28"/> No, but I remember the girl's name. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:30"/> Yes, Sarah Lynn, now we're all up to speed. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:33"/> No, the girl from his story. The one in New Mexico. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:37"/> He was weirdly proud of it, said her name was Penny Carson. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:41"/> Carson, eh? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:43"/> "Penny Carson," he said. "And that's her real name, you can
    look her up!" </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:47"/> I remember thinking, "Why does he want us to look her up?" </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:52"/>
    <sound noise="both"/> Hmm. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:17:55"/> So she's sexy, but don't you call her sweetheart. </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:03"/> -Stop! -What? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:04"/> -I'm sorry, I can't let you-- -Uh, excuse me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:07"/> Are you already-- Sorry. I'm sure she's got a great pitch, but
    the movie you want, it's just not realistic. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:11"/> Sure it is. Wendy Wiggum ate fire as a baby and now she holds
    the power of the Fireflame. It's all very logical. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:17"/> No, I just mean you're doing this all wrong. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:19"/> She saves the day, and everybody loves her? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:22"/> I mean, yeah, that makes sense if she's a man. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:24"/> But it's never worked like that for me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:25"/> Well, this isn't about you. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:27"/> That's right! It's about an exotic dancer who's also
    interdimensional. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:31"/> No. I mean the rules are different for women. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:18:33"/> If you're a woman and you save the day, nobody loves you. </line>

   </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:02"/> When shall I return? Well, I haven't sorted that out yet. </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:22:09"/> Well, we're here. </line>
   <line>

    "Fireflame"! </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:23"/> Yeah. So I need an actress. Someone tough, but vulnerable. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:28"/> I know you're working with Gina Cazador. What do you think of
    her? </line>

    <timestamp data-time="00:22:34"/> She's very versatile. Really talented. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:37"/> But personality-wise, what's she like? Is she good to work
    with? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:40"/> I can't risk any drama on set. There's too much riding on this
    for me. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:43"/>
    <sound noise="sighs"/> If I'm being honest, I can't recommend her. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:46"/> -No? -Especially if you have a lot of stunts. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:48"/> I mean, don't get me wrong, she's great on camera. She just... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:51"/> -Uh... She can be a little difficult. -What do you mean? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:55"/> I don't know what happened. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:22:56"/> I worked with her a couple years ago, she was great, but,
    um... </line>

   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:12"/> It's fine. You're not even supposed to like it yet. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:14"/> It tastes okay-er over time. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:16"/> Yeah, I'm kind of aspiring to be okay-er over time myself. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:20"/> You know, I actually didn't even drink for like all of
    college. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:23"/> I had some shit go down in high school, and... </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:25"/> You know, there was this girl in my town. Anyway, it's a long
    story. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:29"/> No, I wanna hear it. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:30"/> Okay. She had this man living in her house. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:35"/> You mean like more than one dad? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:37"/> No, no, she had just the one dad, but then there was this
    other guy. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:42"/> -Weird. -Totally weird, right? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:43"/> Okay. So this girl was best friends with my girlfriend. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:46"/> We all went to prom together: me, my girlfriend, the girl, and
    the man. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:51"/> Wait, the man went to prom with you? Yeesh. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:54"/> That's not even the yeesh-iest part. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:23:56"/> This guy bought us bourbon and practically forced us to drink
    it, and then when my girlfriend got alcohol poisoning, he just ditched us at the ER. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:04"/> Was your girlfriend okay? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:06"/> Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it was scary in the moment. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:09"/> We were there all night and they pumped her stomach. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:11"/> And I was pretty traumatized for a while. <sound
     noise="stammers"/> But things are good now. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:14"/> Things are good. Because at some point, I realized it wasn't
    the alcohol's fault, or Maddy's fault, or my fault. It was just some shitty dude, you know? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:24"/> Totally. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:26"/> But you know the craziest part of all? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:28"/> The guy, he's actually kind of famous. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:32"/> -Really? -Yeah, I never heard of him, but it turns out he's
    kind of a movie star. </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:37"/> Who is he? </line>
   <line>
    <timestamp data-time="00:24:39"/>
