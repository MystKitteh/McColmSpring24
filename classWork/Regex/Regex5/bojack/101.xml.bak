                    Around</i>
            </line>
            <line>

            <line>
                <timestamp data-time="00:00:29"/> The show, in which a young, bachelor horse is
                forced to reevaluate his priorities when he agrees to raise three human children,
                was initially dismissed by critics as broad and saccharine and not good, but the
                family comedy struck a chord with America and went on to air for nine seasons. </line>

                people, life is just one long, hard kick in the urethra, and sometimes when you get
                home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show
                about good, likable people who love each other, where, you know, no matter what
                happens, at the end of 30 minutes, everything's gonna turn out okay. </line>
