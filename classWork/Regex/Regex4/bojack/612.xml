{\an8}Shocking revelations today

about BoJack Horseman's involvement

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<line>
{\an8}in the overdose of Sarah Lynn,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<line>
{\an8}in an explosive new

"Hollywoo Reporter" exposé.

{\an8}Is BoJack #canceled?

<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<line>
On "Braxby Means Business

with Biscuits Braxby,"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<line>
BoJack Horseman opens up

in an exclusive interview.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
For the first time ever,

we'll hear the real story

of the last days of Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<line>
[Paige] I don't believe it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<line>
I left shoe leather

in six different states

and spun the scoop of my career

all to get sidetracked by a sit-down

with a second-rate celebrity suck-up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<line>
Relax. Your story's clearly

doing something

if they're scrambling

to do damage control so fast.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
That's just it, Patience,

my sister and lifelong confidante.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<line>
These schmoozey charlatans will pour syrup

all over this stack of Shinola

and try to tell you it's pancakes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<line>
And I'm powerless to prevent it!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<line>
Don't you have enough dirt

for a whole other story?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
You know full well

once I become Baxter's bride,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<line>
I'm trading board rooms for bedrooms,

watches for swatches

and deadlines for bedtimes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<line>
Okay, so then get married and forget

about this BoJack story.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<line>
I mean, who cares, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<line>
Patience, you cut to the core

like a classic Sinclair.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<line>
I shall miss making mincemeat

of the misdeeds of mischievous miscreants,

but I must focus on my new mission,

as I transition from miss to missus.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>
Why do you talk like that?

We're from Fresno.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:26" />

<line>
{\an8}[theme music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:23" />

<line>
Huh, they're really hyping up

this BoJack interview.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:26" />

<line>
I gotta admit I'm kinda curious.

You're gonna watch, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:29" />

<line>
No. I can't waste my energy

getting worked up about that guy, Guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:32" />

<line>
I've done enough of that.

Like, years of that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:34" />

<line>
-Yeah, but it's not like you can just--

-I need to work on my book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />

<line>
These mall-related mysteries

aren't gonna solve themselves.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:39" />

<line>
Spoken like a very emotionally

healthy woman,

productive professional writer

and super-cute girlfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:44" />

<line>
We already know what BoJack's gonna say.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<line>
He'll admit to everything in the story,

but nothing else.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:48" />

<line>
He'll trot out this sad-sack routine,

 everyone will feel bad for him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:51" />

<line>
He'll talk about his addictions.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<line>
"Showbiz is awful.

My parents were abusive."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<line>
He'll say he's changed.

That he's not that guy anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<line>
-Yeah. You sound real done with it.

-I am! I'm just saying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:59" />

<line>
They'll make you feel bad for him,

without it being too sad...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<line>
{\an8}...because too sad is a bring-down.

We wanna shoot for pensive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<line>
And this will keep you

from talking with your hands,

which can be construed as aggressive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<line>
And whatever you do, don't get defensive!

Don't deny anything, and don't argue.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<line>
{\an8}-[sighs]

-Give me a smile.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
{\an8}Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<line>
{\an8}Whoa! Am I my third favorite

Bruce Springsteen song

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<line>
{\an8}because I was not "Born in the USA"

nor am I "Tougher Than the Rest,"

but I am "Blinded By the Light"!

Nice smile, buddy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<line>
Do you need to be here right now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<line>
{\an8}Since your interview is leading

into the season finale of "Birthday Dad,"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<line>
{\an8}I wanted to officially welcome you

to the MBN Thursday Night family.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<line>
Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<line>
{\an8}And to ask if it wouldn't be

too much trouble for you

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
{\an8}to shout out "Birthday Dad"

during your interview?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<line>
{\an8}-Why would I--

-But only if the interview is going well.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<line>
{\an8}If the interview is going poorly,

please do not bring up "Birthday Dad."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<line>
-[baby cooing]

-Hey, Princess Carolyn, I-- Oh. BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<line>
-Getting ready for the interview?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh! You've got your work cut out for you,

because people hate you right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<line>
{\an8}-I'm aware, thank you.

-That story... Wow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
{\an8}Really well-written, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<line>
{\an8}Yeah, the power of the prose

was not the first thing I noticed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<line>
{\an8}Haunting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
Anyway, Princess Carolyn,

is it cool if I take tomorrow night off

for a date with Maude?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<line>
Todd, I keep hearing about

this new girlfriend of yours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
When do I meet her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
You can probably take this part

of the conversation elsewhere.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<line>
Right this way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<line>
We should go on a double date

with you and Pickles!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<line>
Pickles and I are putting our relaysh

on a brief hiate at the mo,

but as soon as she returns

from her work trip...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
-[phone buzzes]

-Uh, oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<line>
Excuse me, I'm receiving a text message

and it appears we have broken up forever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
-You're gonna be great.

-[exhales] Yeah. Where are we doing this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
I got them to take the "Philbert" set

out of storage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<line>
Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<line>
Because we want the intimacy

and vulnerability of your home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<line>
You're saying, "This is me. No more lies."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<line>
But since we're pre-taping it

in the afternoon,

we're using the set to make it look

like it's nighttime.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<line>
Makes sense.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
{\an8}[jingle playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<line>
I'm here with BoJack Horseman

in his actual house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
BoJack, a story came out this morning

about the last days of Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
How did it make you feel?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
Honestly? I felt relieved

that now I can stop lying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
-[light crashes]

-[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
-Are the allegations in the story true?

-[clears throat] They are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
Sarah Lynn was nine months sober.

I invited her on a bender.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
We spiraled together for a little over

a month and then she overdosed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<line>
On heroin you purchased for her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<line>
-Well, I didn't purchase it for her--

-There's no need to get defensive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<line>
I'm just trying to be accurate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
I-I didn't purchase it at all.

I just had it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
[Biscuits] You just had heroin?

Lying around.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
No, no, no, no, not <i>lying around.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<line>
[scoffs] You're making it sound

like I had extra heroin,

because I do so much heroin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
I had that heroin

because I wasn't doing heroin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
So, I had it. You understand?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
In your original statement to the police,

you said she called you,

you came to the planetarium and found her.

That was a lie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<line>
Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
Would you say Sarah Lynn dying

was your rock bottom?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
I don't believe in rock bottoms.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
I've had a lot of what I thought

were rock bottoms only to discover

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
-another rockier bottom underneath.

-That sounds dangerous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<line>
Eventually, I decided to stop waiting

for something to change me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<line>
I had to make the change myself.

And that's why I went to rehab.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
And I'm very proud to be one year sober

next month.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<line>
So, if I'm understanding you correctly,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
Sarah Lynn dying

was part of that decision?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
Uh, it was part of it, yes.

Uh, I've made a lot of mistakes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<line>
Can you share some of those

other mistakes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
I... I don't think

that it would be fair to the people

who were affected by those mistakes,

all of whom I've apologized to in private.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<line>
Now that you're sober,

do you think you'll stop

making these mistakes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<line>
I do. It's been a lot of work,

but I look back at that other BoJack

and I think, "Who is that?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<line>
And who was he?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<line>
I came from a broken home,

and I used to feel like my whole life

was an acting job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<line>
Just doing an impression of the people

I saw on television,

which was just the projection of a bunch

of equally screwed-up writers and actors.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<line>
I felt like a Xerox of a Xerox

of a person, you know what I mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<line>
-But not anymore?

-No. Now I feel like me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<line>
It must have been difficult

to see those same patterns

repeat themselves with Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<line>
I think that's why her death

was so scary for me,

why I didn't wanna confront it,

because she reminded me of myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
Some have accused Sarah Lynn's mother

of exploiting her death.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<line>
When you hear "All Twerk and No Play"

in a Geico commercial,

or see Sarah Lynn's face on a billboard

with the slogan "I'd die for a Pepsi,"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
-how does that make you feel?

-Sad. Angry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<line>
Honestly, it feels like

that's what killed her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
Not the heroin?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<line>
No, you're right.

It was mostly the heroin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
If you could talk to her mother now,

what would you say to her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<line>
I would say... I wish you could know...

how sorry I am.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<line>
[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
-Am I crazy or did I nail that?

-It was good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
Oh, man, when she brought up

Sarah Lynn's mother?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:49" />

<line>
She was setting me up

to throw her under the bus,

but then I said I'm sorry?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
I mean, that was a sweet move, yeah?

I felt like I could see <i>The Matrix!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<line>
You've definitely gotten

your 10,000 hours in

when it comes to apologizing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<line>
It was good, right?

People are gonna like it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
Yeah, well, we'll find out in three hours

when it airs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<line>
And that's why the band Chicago

is not one of the top ten Chicago bands

of all time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
Hmm, it's okay

if you wanna watch. All right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
He's your friend, it's a big deal for him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<line>
-You don't have to be so weird about it.

-I'm not being weird. I'm in a good place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<line>
I don't wanna get dragged back

into that other stuff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
That's great! But, you know,

it is a little weird

that one of your best friends

is a huge celebrity

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<line>
-and you never wanna talk about him.

-Roxy's really more my "best" best friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<line>
But you never talk about Roxy either!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<line>
I don't understand what her job is

and it's too late for me to ask.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<line>
And you were also married

to a huge celebrity.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<line>
And you never talk about him either.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<line>
You don't share your past life with me.

You wanna talk about weird?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
I've lived here six months

and I still haven't met your son.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<line>
[stammers] Okay. But you don't really

wanna meet Sonny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<line>
Of course I do!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<line>
All right, cool.

Let's get dinner tomorrow.

<line>
As a recovering addict myself,

I was spellbound!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<line>
Wow. I had no idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<line>
And I see no reason

why you shouldn't return to Wesleyan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<line>
Uh, small latte?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<line>
-My manager told me not to charge you.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<line>
He said he watched

your interview last night,

then turned off the TV

and went straight

to his first AA meeting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<line>
Huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<line>
No "Birthday Dad."

<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
-So, I nailed it.

-You kidding?

the best ratings we've seen in years!

of not having to sell ourselves

to a larger media company

that strips us for office furniture.

<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
I wanna strike while the iron is hot

and do a part two tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<line>
-Part two?

-There is no part two.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
It's right there in the title,

"The Last Days of Sarah Lynn."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<line>
Just sit down with Biscuits again

and tell a few more colorful anecdotes

from your years partying in Hollywoo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<line>
Then, an encore presentation

of the "Birthday Dad" finale.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<line>
Makes sense.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<line>
We got what we wanted out of this.

I don't think we should push it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<line>
We're starting a dialogue.

I'm helping people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<line>
Move over, Sad Dog.

Make room for Remorse Horse!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<line>
That's great BoJack, but--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<line>
Listen, I'm ready to move on

and go back to Connecticut,

but it does feel good to be part

of the conversation again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<line>
And if my openness and candor

about addiction is helping people,

then I'm kind of a dick

if I don't do another interview, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<line>
[Pinky] <i>I mean, I wasn't gonna say it.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<line>
{\an8}[jingle playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
Thank you so much for inviting us

into your home

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<line>
-for another night of questions.

-Are you kidding?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<line>
You couldn't keep me away!

Because this is my house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<line>
[light crashes]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<line>
I wanna start

with another Sarah Lynn question.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<line>
Oh, here we go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<line>
Speaking of addicts,

I think you're addicted to Sarah Lynn!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<line>
[chuckles] You told the police

you weren't with her when she died.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
That she called you from the planetarium.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<line>
Yes, I lied.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<line>
Weren't you afraid the police would check

the phone records?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<line>
Oh! Well, I wasn't thinking clearly.

Guess I'm not a criminal mastermind!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<line>
But the police did check

the phone records,

and your story checked out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<line>
There was a two-minute phone call

made from her phone to your phone,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
17 minutes before you called 911.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
-Oh?

-If you were with her,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>
-how do you explain the phone call?

-I, um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<line>
I called myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
After I realized what had had happened,

I took her phone and I called myself

so I could make it look like

she called me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<line>
-Why?

-I went into panic mode.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
And then what did you do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<line>
I thought we were gonna talk

about other stuff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<line>
What did you do after you called

your own phone, BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<line>
I went outside to the parking lot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<line>
And you just waited there for 17 minutes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<line>
Why are you asking about this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<line>
Biscuits Braxby.

Paige Sinclair. You've been had.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<line>
A pleasure to meet you. Had by who?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<line>
The pleasure is mine,

the pronoun is whom,

and the whom is the horse.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<line>
BoJack? I got him to spill his guts

about the worst moment of his life

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<line>
{\an8}on national television for huge ratings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<line>
Your disgusting display

of soft-pedaling sycophancy

made me wanna quit

the journalism business altogether,

two days prior to when I get married

and quit the journalism

business altogether.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<line>
But the Biscuits Braxby brand

is keeping things light.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<line>
Celebs come on my show

because I make 'em look good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
That access keeps me relevant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
But to what benefit is your relevance

if it's squandered

in the service of public relations?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
With the advent of social media,

celebs don't need you

to make them look good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<line>
And if you don't alter your strategy soon,

you'll have no career left to save.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<line>
Face it, chinchilla, you're all wet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
Well, I...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<line>
Ugh! Even if I wanted to do a hard-hitting

interview, what would I say?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<line>
I've a few ideas...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<line>
-You keep looking over to your manager.

-Well, I--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<line>
-Can we talk about your relationship?

-Princess Carolyn?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
-You dated her for seven years?

-Yes, and look! She's alive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<line>
Did it ever get complicated,

working with her while maintaining

a sexual relationship?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<line>
Well, she's always been good

at keeping her personal

and professional lives separate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<line>
-Quite an accomplished woman.

-You said it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<line>
She was an agent's assistant

when I met her

and now she's running her own company.

Plus, she's a great mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<line>
[chuckles] Oh, fish! Mom!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
-I forgot about Todd's date!

-I can watch Ruthie for a few hours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<line>
[whispers] Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<line>
What can you tell me

about Marcy Jerominek?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<line>
-Who?

-In the '90s, you had a fan club--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<line>
-How do you know all this?

-Do you know where I'm going here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<line>
[sighs] Marcy. Yes.

She was the president of my fan club.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
You slept with her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<line>
We had a lovely evening together.

We both got something out of it, and--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<line>
Did you take a high school girl

to her prom?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<line>
-That was a family friend.

-Did you help a teen mom

sneak out of rehab

and take her to a high school party?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<line>
I didn't <i>take</i> her. We went together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<line>
Is it true you once dated a woman

who'd just woken up

from a 30-year coma?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<line>
-Were you attracted to her naiveté, too?

-What does all this have to with--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<line>
You had sex with the president

of your fan club.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<line>
You had sex with your agent's assistant.

You party with underage girls.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<line>
-You don't see a pattern here?

-It's not a pattern.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<line>
-Do you enjoy having power over women?

-I don't even know what that means.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<line>
You don't know what it means

to have power over women?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<line>
I don't have power over anyone.

I barely have power over myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<line>
But you do have power over people.

And again and again, you abuse that power.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<line>
All these women that you mentioned,

I never forced myself--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<line>
Not through force,

but you understand the power differential.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<line>
So, I can't be with any woman

I might have power over?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<line>
-Who does that leave me with?

-I'm just pointing out a series of--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<line>
You think everything

is this nefarious scheme.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<line>
Most of the bad shit

that happens in this world

isn't because of wicked plots

and machinations.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<line>
It's just because we're all

a bunch of stupid, hungry,

horny little goons just grabbing at shit,

hoping it'll press that little button

in our brain that says,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<line>
"Okay, you're happy now."

That's not an "abuse of power."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<line>
Do you really believe you didn't have

the power in all of those relationships?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<line>
I... I am an addict.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<line>
One of the first things that I had

to accept was my own powerlessness.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<line>
-But that's--

-I understand what I did was wrong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<line>
I'm not denying that.

But you're trying to paint this picture.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<line>
You're making it out like I'm a bad guy,

and I'm not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
I'm not that guy you're saying I am.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<line>
-So, back to Sarah Lynn...

-No. Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<line>
You gave her the heroin...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<line>
I already told you, yes.

How many times can I say it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<line>
Breaking news! The thing I told you

yesterday is still true.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
-Did you ever give Sarah Lynn alcohol?

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<line>
The first time Sarah Lynn ever got drunk,

she was a child, and it was vodka, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
How... how do you know about that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<line>
You were bringing vodka

to the set of "Horsin' Around."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<line>
Who told you all this stuff?

Did Sharona tell you that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<line>
Doctor Champ,

thank you for returning my call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<line>
I didn't wanna say anything,

but just watching BoJack

in that interview,

talking like he's a victim in all this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

<line>
If the world only knew the things

I know...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:34" />

<line>
I understand as a therapist,

you're not at liberty to divulge

what your client told you in confidence.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<line>
But I'm not a therapist.

I'm a therapy horse.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<line>
And I can tell you everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<line>
Because Sharona was a drunk, too,

so you can't trust a thing she says.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<line>
Obviously, she has a vendetta against me.

Besides, I already apologized to her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<line>
Apologized for what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<line>
Okay, when you put it all together,

it looks bad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<line>
Do you see any connection between

those other women and Sarah Lynn?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<line>
There's no connection between anyone,

that's what I keep saying!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<line>
Sarah Lynn wasn't like those other girls.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<line>
I loved Sarah Lynn.

She was like a daughter to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<line>
I just keep seeing this story of you

taking young women...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<line>
-No.

-Grooming them...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<line>
I didn't <i>groom</i> anyone, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<line>
It's not like I got Sarah Lynn drunk

for the purpose

of taking advantage of her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<line>
She was ten! I didn't even have sex

with her until she was 30!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:20" />

<line>
-I'm sorry, what?

-No. I just mean that--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<line>
-Did you say you had sex with her?

-That was later. She was an adult.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<line>
And we were both so drunk and high,

I didn't--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<line>
We didn't know what we were doing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<line>
We were addicts,

and the thing about addicts--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<line>
-This was during your bender?

-Yeah. No! A different bender.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<line>
I took her to rehab, by the way!

I tried to get her help.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<line>
I just keep thinking

about those 17 minutes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<line>
You waiting in the parking lot

after she died.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<line>
But she wasn't actually dead yet.

She died in the hospital.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<line>
-Right, but at the time, I didn't...

-Ever wonder what would've happened

if you didn't take those 17 minutes?

Do you think she might still--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<line>
No! I... Look, obviously

when I did all that stuff, I wasn't--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<line>
So to recap, you gave Sarah Lynn alcohol

when she was a child.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<line>
She then became an addict.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<line>
Come on, there was a lot of stuff

in between--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<line>
I'm talking now. You're not talking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<line>
When she was intoxicated,

you had sex with her,

and when she was sober,

you gave her the heroin that killed her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<line>
Then in an effort to cover for yourself,

you waited to call the paramedics

that might have saved her life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:17" />

<line>
And you don't think

you have any power over women.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<line>
So, it didn't go great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<line>
The gross part is she doesn't even care.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
This is just a ratings win she can use

as leverage for her next big paycheck.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<line>
-Maybe.

-She was all over the place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<line>
I think people are gonna see

that she was just out to get me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<line>
-People are gonna see that, right?

-I guess we'll find out tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<line>
Okay, maybe she had some good points,

but she completely

undermined herself with, like...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<line>
I mean, we dated for like seven years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<line>
Do you think that I took advantage of you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<line>
-[sighs] I'm here, aren't I?

-And she kept bringing it back to women--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<line>
These "women I hurt"

because that's what's hip now, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<line>
Hurting women?

But I have also hurt a lot of men!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<line>
I told you to do just the one interview

and go back to Connecticut.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
-But it's gonna be okay, right?

-[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<line>
You wanna grab some tacos?

What do you think?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<line>
-I think you have three hours...

-[car alarm chirps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<line>
...before this interview airs

and your world changes completely.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<line>
You should think about

how you wanna spend that time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<line>
I'm going home to my daughter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<line>
[engine starts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<line>
-Sonny! It's great to finally meet you.

-Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<line>
-Sonny! Come on!

-Good evening, ma'am.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<line>
Whoa! [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<line>
What's this? You made varsity?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<line>
Yeah. Coach moved me up

for the rest of the season.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<line>
-Wow! Congratulations!

-That's amazing! Why didn't you tell me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<line>
I wanted to wait for the jacket.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<line>
I'm so proud of you, buddy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<line>
We should get Chicago-style cheese fries

to celebrate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
-Oh! I'll get--

-I'm getting cheese fries.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
-[chuckles] So... lacrosse.

-What's your deal?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<line>
-What?

-My dad has a thing for broken women.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<line>
Then he nurses them back to health,

and when they're better they leave.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
You gonna leave him?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<line>
-Does your dad think I'm gonna leave him?

-It doesn't matter, because eventually

my mom and dad

are gonna get back together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
They're still in love.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<line>
-What? No, they hate each other.

-No, they don't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<line>
-They fight all the time.

-Wha-- Really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<line>
-[cries]

-Oh! Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
-My dad hates my mom?

-Uh... No! Of course not!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
Then why would you say that?

You're so mean!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<line>
[sobs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<line>
I was gone for two minutes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<line>
Huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
Ah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
Is this anything?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<line>
"My girlfriend was upset

I gave her a CD for Christmas.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<line>
But she gave me VD for Hanukkah!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<line>
That's nothing.

And possibly anti-Semitic. Hold still.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<line>
Ugh! I am so ready

to never do stand-up again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<line>
Are you gonna put me

on your TV show or what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<line>
I'm telling you, the network loves you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<line>
They just need you to do a screen test.

It's basically a formality.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<line>
-Screen test?

-What, you're too good for it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<line>
No, it's cool! A screen test! Ha!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<line>
You wanna hit Alma's after the show?

Best tacos in LA.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
-I keep telling you it's Neptune's Net.

-Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
Malibu is for pretentious,

rich douchebags.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
That's Beverly Hills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<line>
Malibu is for pretentious

famous douchebags.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<line>
-Hold still so I can finish.

-Finish what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<line>
Look, you might never get a star

on the Walk of Fame or a wax statue.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<line>
But this way you'll always be immortalized

and undisturbed in Hollywood forever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<line>
Unless they repaint.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<line>
[Coltrane] Anybody from out of town?

It's a trick question, it's LA.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
-Everybody's from out of town.

-[audience laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<line>
Most of Los Angeles

isn't even in Los Angeles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<line>
-I mean, Azusa? Excusa?

-[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<line>
[audience laughing, applauding]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
Oh, my God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<line>
-Hey, man. I hated your show.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<line>
-"Horsin' Around." Hated it.

-Yeah, that's a hell of an opener.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<line>
But my baby brother loved it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<line>
I'd be in my bedroom, sulking

and I'd hear him laughing his ass off

in the living room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<line>
He had this great laugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<line>
Drugs took a lot from him,

but he still had that laugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<line>
Right up to the end.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<line>
Now anytime I hear anything about

that show, I hear my brother's laugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<line>
-Thanks for that.

-Well, shit. You're welcome.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<line>
Hey, do you wanna go up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<line>
Oh, man. I...

I haven't done stand-up in years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<line>
You're famous. They'll get

a kick out of it even if you suck.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<line>
[stammers] I don't think so.

Thanks, though.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<line>
[mumbles, sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<line>
[audience laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
Mm-mm. No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<line>
-Hmm. Oh, what about this show?

-Oh, what's it about?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
It's really smart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<line>
It's about New Orleans and jazz

and Hurricane Katrina

and drugs and John Goodman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<line>
-Sounds exciting.

-It's not!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<line>
[Bess] Maude? I heard a man's voice!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<line>
-Yeah, Mom, Todd's over!

-Is that a burglar?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
He's my boyfriend! We're gonna watch TV!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<line>
No shows about burglars, though!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<line>
-You got it, Mom!

-And keep the door open.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<line>
-No funny business!

-[sighs] Okay, Mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<line>
Wanna watch the second part

of the BoJack interview?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<line>
That guy was my best friend

for like five years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<line>
But not because we have anything

in common.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
I just landed at his house one night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<line>
You ever get tired of living

at the mercy of whoever happens

to let you crash on their couch?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<line>
-What do you mean?

-Why don't you get your own place?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn doesn't need

a live-in nanny anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<line>
I think I'd get lonely.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
How about this:

what if you had your own place,

but you shared it with someone?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<line>
-Like a roommate?

-Or a girlfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<line>
[chuckles] But Maude,

you're my girlfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<line>
What am I supposed to do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<line>
Get a second girlfriend

just to live with?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<line>
-No, I--

-And by the way, you're one to talk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
-You still live with your mom.

-Yeah, I--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<line>
-Why don't you get your own place?

-Right, that's actually what--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<line>
Wait. I just got an incredible idea!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<line>
Yeah? Because I just had

an incredible idea, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<line>
Okay, let's both say our ideas

at the same time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<line>
One, two, three.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<line>
-Salty gum.

-Ice cream sandwich flavored ice cream.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<line>
Also, we should move in together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<line>
[audience laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
You know what they don't tell you

about getting sober?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<line>
The hardest part, worse than the DTs

or the looking back at everything you did

or the constant fear of relapse,

the hardest part is figuring out

what the hell to drink

when you order a meal

at a nice restaurant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<line>
You expect me to order

the bucatini carbonara at Gusto

and then drink, what, an Arnold Palmer?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />

<line>
I'm not even a red wine guy, but come on!

"Here's your steak, sir.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />

<line>
Would you like an ice-cold Dr. Pepper

to go with that?" I mean...

</line>
