[voicemail] <i>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:09" />

<line>
<i>Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</i>

[beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<line>
Hey, Hollyhock.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<line>
Um, you still haven't returned

my last call, which is fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
I just... I know you're going back

to school soon,

and you should know I won't be there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
Because of... everything

you've probably heard about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
So, if you were worried

you'd have to see me, you won't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<line>
But I would love to talk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
-It's BoJack.

-[beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<line>
[man] <i>Welcome to Burritos and Mo!</i>

<i>Home of burritos and much, much mo!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<line>
-Give me a large number three.

<i>-Oh, my God. Ellie! Look at the monitor.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<line>
<i>It's fricking BoJack Horseman.</i>

<i>Don't worry, I muted it.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<line>
-[Ellie] <i>He looks like crap.</i>

<i>-Yeah. His tie is all loosened up,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<line>
<i>which is like the universal sign</i>

<i>for having a shitty day.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<line>
[Ellie] <i>Probably because he just came</i>

<i>from court. It's all over the news.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<line>
<i>He just settled with Sarah Lynn's family</i>

<i>for five million dollars.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<line>
[man] <i>Makes sense. He seemed like</i>

<i>a real psycho in that interview</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<line>
<i>-he did a few months back.</i>

-Yeah. Guys.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
[Ellie] <i>I'm surprised he'd still</i>

<i>wanna show his face in public.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<line>
-Hey!

-[man] <i>His face is everywhere.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<line>
<i>-The cover of every magazine.</i>

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
<i>Even got the number-one slot</i>

<i>for Hundred Most Hatted Men.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
-No, it--

-[Ellie] <i>Most Hatted Men? What is that?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<line>
[man] <i>List of men in hats, I guess.</i>

<i>He was wearing a fedora.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<line>
It was Most Hated Men!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<line>
-[Ellie gasps]

-[man] <i>What?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<line>
It was the Hundred Most Hated Men,

it was a newsboy cap,

and I can hear everything

you've been saying!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<line>
[Ellie] <i>Uh...</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>
-[man] <i>Get his bags, Ellie!</i>

<i>-You said you muted it!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

[BoJack grunting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<line>
-[man] Have a burrito-ful day!

-[man 2] Hey! [grunts] You suck, asshole!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<line>
-[sighs]

-[theme music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:30" />

<line>
[bleating]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:31" />

<line>
I don't think it's wise

to be burning Bridges at this juncture.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<line>
I'm sorry, just don't like Beau.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<line>
{\an8}-Greetings, strangers!

-Maude?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />

<line>
{\an8}That's what they want you to think!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm Maude's twin sister Fergus,

we have never met before,

and I'd be delighted to accept a job

at this company.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:44" />

<line>
{\an8}-[scoffs] What?

-As you know, I have 12 children.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:47" />

<line>
What sort of day care services

do you provide here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:49" />

<line>
{\an8}Has this ever happened to you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<line>
{\an8}Todd? At the office?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:53" />

<line>
Can we wrap whatever this is up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm supposed to head over

to the "Birthday Dad" set.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<line>
{\an8}I wanna run a day care at VIM!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:59" />

<line>
{\an8}I've mastered the art of looking

at one baby and I'm ready for more.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:03" />

<line>
You do have several employees

with children.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<line>
{\an8}If you employ Todd through the company,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<line>
{\an8}you could offer him a raise

and still save money on taxes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<line>
Great. It's done.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<line>
{\an8}Hooray! Corporate tax loophole!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<line>
{\an8}Plus, we can carpool to the office.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
{\an8}Which leads me to my next point.

I am moving out to live with Maude.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<line>
{\an8}It's me! It's Maude.

I don't really have a twin sister.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<line>
{\an8}Hey, that's fantastic!

Where are you moving to?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<line>
Um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<line>
-You can stay here! Live with me forever!

-[director] Cut!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<line>
{\an8}The line is,

"Thank you for the birthday pizza.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<line>
{\an8}Today, I am your dad."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<line>
-Oh, sorry!

-Let's take five?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<line>
{\an8}-Hey, champ. Everything okay?

-I'm just distracted.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<line>
{\an8}Ever since Pickles left, I've been

so lonely in that big, empty house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<line>
I've always had a wife or a girlfriend,

someone to take care of.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn,

you're perpetually alone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<line>
{\an8}-How do you manage?

-One day at a time, buddy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
I went to the doctor to see

if he could make me feel better,

he said, "You should check out

this Internet meme,

it always cheers me up: Sad Dog."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<line>
And I said, "But Doctor, I am Sad Dog."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
Guys, I'm really sorry

this keeps happening.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<line>
When I got home, I found my wife

and daughter had moved out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<line>
All they left behind was this picture.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
-Okay. Rude.

-Shh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
It's the stock photo

that came in the frame.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
My wife kept asking me to put in a picture

of our family, but I was always too drunk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<line>
But because of all of you

and my sponsor Leo,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<line>
I'm no longer just the man

who's not in this picture.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<line>
I'm a different, better man

who is also not in this picture.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
Who's next?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<line>
-Um, okay, I'll speak.

-Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<line>
Things have been pretty brutal

for me lately.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<line>
-Most people hate me...

-Mm-hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<line>
...I just lost five million dollars,

so that's not great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
Could probably use a Leo

of my own right about now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<line>
Wow, tough room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
This AA meeting is a tough room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
Hey, I'll be your sponsor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<line>
Oh! Um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
I know what you're thinking,

"Vance Waggoner?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<line>
That guy's gonna be my sponsor?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
The guy Charlie Sheen

once called 'a little much'?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
-Uh...

-"Vance Waggoner?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<line>
That guy's got more domestic assault

convictions than Sean Penn!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
And now you're thinking,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<line>
"Did Sean Penn get convicted

of domestic assault

or was it just alleged?

I gotta look that up later."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<line>
-I'm sure--

-Now you're thinking,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<line>
"Why would someone this cool

and put-together wanna sponsor me,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<line>
-dumb slob BoJack Horseman?"

-That's not--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
Wait. I've been where you've been, BoJack.

And everyone abandoned me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<line>
If you need someone to talk to,

give me a call, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<line>
My number is 555-555-8008.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
Because sometimes

life turns you upside-down,

and when you're upside-down,

my number is boobs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
[phone buzzing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<line>
-[beeps]

-Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<line>
Diane! How are the revisions going?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
Good! Usually at this stage

I hate everything I've ever written

and I feel like a worthless hack,

but this book actually isn't terrible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
Great, so when can we expect

the not-terrible sequel,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<line>
"Ivy Tran Two: A Tran for All Seasons"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<line>
I don't know, Ivy Tran was fun

but I'm a grown-up writer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<line>
<i>There are other things I wanna write.</i>

<i>Did you know Eleanor Roosevelt--</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<line>
-Interesting.

-I didn't even tell you the thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<line>
I know.

I was interested in you not telling me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
Okay, good bit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<line>
In the meantime,

if you're interested in writing books

that people actually read,

you'll get to work on "Ivy Tran Two:

Last Tran to Clarksville."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<line>
-Eleanor Roosevelt once--

<i>-Interesting!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<line>
[disconnect tone]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<line>
[audience laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<line>
[woman] <i>And those congressional</i>

<i>turd-weasels</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<line>
<i>actually called this legislation</i>

<i>the "Anti-Corruption Bill!"</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<line>
<i>That's like if BoJack Horseman</i>

<i>wore a T-shirt that said,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<line>
<i>"I am not a ginormous dick-weasel!"</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<line>
Hey, that is an unfair drive-by!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<line>
<i>Now, I know this Photoshop is not up</i>

<i>to our program's usual standards,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<line>
<i>but in our graphic department's defense,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<line>
<i>none of them could spend ten minutes</i>

<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<line>
<i>without their uteruses</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<line>
-[phone ringing, buzzing]

-Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
-[beeps]

-Yes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
BoJack, it's your very good

accountant Gaz.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<line>
-I'm here with...

-Your very good lawyer Chaz!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<line>
The good news is the Sarah Lynn settlement

isn't gonna kill us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
What's the bad news?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<line>
The bad news is you're being sued

for a hundred million dollars.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<line>
-What?

-Remember in your interview,

when you disparagingly referred

to yourself as "a Xerox of a Xerox"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
The Xerox Corporation did not appreciate

being implicated

in your untoward behavior.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
Just so I'm clear, Sarah Lynn's death

cost me five million dollars,

but saying something bad about a brand

is gonna cost me a hundred million?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<line>
When you frame it that way,

it almost seems comical!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<line>
But it is not comical,

because a hundred million dollars

is a lot of money you do not have.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
Okay, so what's the move?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
-Funny you should mention "move."

-[doorbell rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
Your accountant told me

 you wanted to sell your house?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:49" />

<line>
-Okay, I'm gonna call you back.

-So, I sold your house!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<line>
Wow-ee! It looks better than the pictures!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<line>
-You sold my house?

-Golly, are you...?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
Sylvester Stallion.

From the Rocky movies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<line>
Oh! Hey, you kids wanna go check out

the pool?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<line>
-[boy] Yeah!

-[girl] I love my new life!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<line>
You sold my house?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
I found this sweet, sweet family from Ohio

whose kid just got cast in a movie!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<line>
I wanted to make sure the ink dried

on the mortgage

before they find out the movie's

being shot in Saskatchewan. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
So, where do I go?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<line>
What do I look like, a real estate agent?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<line>
-Wait.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
Your mail came.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<line>
-Now leave. You're harshing the buzz.

-But...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
-Well, I'm all moved in.

-[sighs] Me too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<line>
Wow! Got a promotion

and my own apartment all in the same day.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
-I never realized my boyfriend was butter.

-You're right. I am on a roll!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<line>
What should I do next?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<line>
[ringing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
Chavez residence, this is Jorge.

Please state the purpose of your call

so I can most appropriately

modulate my tone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
Hey, it's Todd. Is Mom there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
Ah! Todd! Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<line>
Oh. She's resting at the moment.

Can I take a message?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<line>
I just wanted her to know that

I don't have anything to prove to her,

but I got a new job and an apartment,

so if I did have something

to prove to her,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<line>
-I'd have proven it by now.

-Well, that's wonderful, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<line>
Yes. And quite mature.

And she won't even talk to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
-Does she know I'm butter?

-I'm glad to hear you're on a roll.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<line>
We'd love to see your home

once you're settled.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<line>
What's that supposed to mean?

I'm settled! I'm a grown-ass Todd!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
-No, I just meant--

-I don't need to impress you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<line>
Why don't you come

to my fancy, sophisticated

housewarming party tomorrow night

and see for yourself!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
Consider us there. What can we bring?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

-Two chairs!

-[beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<line>
We could throw together a party, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<line>
Um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
-No.

-I need a job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<line>
There are no offers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<line>
-Can you check? Ask around?

-I'm checking. I'm asking around.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<line>
-[gasps] There are no offers.

-But I'm broke and homeless.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<line>
[scoffs] I can get you a small role

on "Birthday Dad."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<line>
Great. Have my pages delivered

to me at the Chateau Marmoset.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<line>
-You just said you're broke!

-And homeless.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<line>
You are not staying at a fancy hotel.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<line>
Who else would have me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<line>
You could stay here! Live with me forever!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<line>
-[sizzling]

-[Mr. Peanutbutter humming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<line>
And flip! Morning, sunshine!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
I hope I didn't wake you

with the delicious smell

of a well-balanced breakfast.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<line>
-Less talky. More coffee.

-You got it, roomie!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<line>
-Coffee maker, make!

-[beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<line>
Took the liberty of doing your laundry

and this letter was in your pocket.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<line>
-[gasps, screams]

-Ooh-hoo! A mysterious pen pal!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<line>
Is it a secret admirer

or the snowman killer still at large?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
It's from Hollyhock. But... [sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:48" />

<line>
I can't open it. What if she says

she never wants to hear from me again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<line>
Or maybe it says "I got rid of my TV

three months ago. What's new, BoJack?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<line>
I should just call her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
If I could talk to her,

I feel like I could explain that--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<line>
[voicemail] <i>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</i>

<i>Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<line>
-[voicemail beeps]

-Hey, Hollyhock. It's me again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<line>
And his good friend and roommate

and coworker, Mr. Peanutbutter!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
It's our first day of work together!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<line>
I got your letter

and I haven't read it yet,

but I'm going to and...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<line>
It's really great to hear your voice...

your voicemail voice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
-Just give me a call. It's BoJack.

-[beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
-Ready to go?

-What about this breakfast?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<line>
We don't have time for that!

You can feed me while I drive, let's go!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
<i>-♪ Precision... ♪</i>

-[Todd] Oh, whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>
-Easy. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop!

-[kids giggling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<line>
Hey, Judah. I need your advice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<line>
I'm trying to throw

a sophisticated adult party

to impress my parents

and I have no furniture

or sophisticated adult friends.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
I'm alarmed. Do you not consider me

a sophisticated adult or a friend?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
Judah, this is no time for one

of your famous Judah tantrums!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<line>
 Sounds like you need to throw together

a scheme in a short amount of time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<line>
In situations like this, I often think,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<line>
-"What would Todd do?"

-And?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<line>
He'd probably scour VIM's talent list

for underemployed actors,

tell them they've been hired

for a site-specific immersive

theater piece as cosmopolitan partygoers,

invite just enough real friends

to lend it an air of legitimacy

and raid the "Birthday Dad" set

for furniture.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
That's brilliant!

Todd, I've done it again!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
-Let's go, babies!

-[giggling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<line>
Uh... Babies. Come on!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<line>
-[trunk trumpets]

-[giggling continues]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<line>
War.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<line>
And for what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
-A couple trophies? A parade?

-[BoJack groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
No. Not for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<line>
Maybe I'm just a crazy,

old birthday person,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<line>
-but I think war is bad.

-[bell rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<line>
Great job, Mr. Peanutbutter.

You're changing hearts and minds.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<line>
Isn't this great? Working together?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
For the next take,

can we get Dead Body Number Four

to face away from the camera?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
-Oh! That's you!

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<line>
-Exciting!

-[grunts, groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<line>
[director] All the way away

from the camera.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<line>
[grunts, groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<line>
[muffled] I can't really breathe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<line>
That's okay. Let's run it again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<line>
-[screams]

-Cool dressing room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<line>
And great work on that scene.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<line>
You really seemed like

a hollowed-out corpse.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<line>
Once animated by the fire of life,

now consumed by horror

and regret, and for what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<line>
Great. You wanna get dinner?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
Oh, I'd love to, buddy,

but I have like five more scenes to shoot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
Oh. Of course, yeah.

I'll see you back at the house then?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<line>
Yeah. Oh! I'm probably going to head

right to Todd's fancy party after work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<line>
Todd's having a fancy party?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

we're ready for the scene

where you help an American soldier

and a Taliban insurgent

realize they both have the same birthday.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<line>
-It's Christmas.

-Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />

<line>
[line ringing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<line>
BoJack!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<line>
[Todd] Greetings, cast!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<line>
As you know,

you have been hired to play urbane,

civilized party guests.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<line>
So, if at any point tonight

a "member of the audience"

tries to talk to you,

please say one

of the three following phrases

that elegant adults say all the time:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<line>
"I'm starting to think smart phones

are actually making us less connected."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<line>
-Oh, yeah!

-"Well, that's politics for you!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<line>
Or, "Sir, you cannot remove your shoes

inside this Applebee's."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<line>
[all] Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<line>
-Hey!

-Hello.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<line>
What's that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<line>
It's a case of Ass-Jolt,

Pickles' favorite alcoholic energy drink.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<line>
I don't need them anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<line>
-Oh, fish, I forgot a gift.

-You have two options.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<line>
This sourdough starter

or a haiku I wrote on a grain of rice

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<line>
-and then suspended in a bottle.

-Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<line>
Why don't we just say

they're both from both of us?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<line>
Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<line>
-[woman gasps] Ugh.

-And you don't wanna open it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<line>
I'm not ready. As long as I don't read it,

she's still in my life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
It's good to have people that remind us

why we stay sober.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<line>
That's what my daughter is for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<line>
Here's your sandwich.

Chef made it just for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
Hmph, hmph, hmph.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<line>
Okay, do I have a horn?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
Because everybody keeps looking at me

like I'm some kind of freak.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<line>
Well, if you've got a horn,

you're the ugliest unicorn I ever saw.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<line>
You'd be kicked out of the unicorn kingdom

because you couldn't get a date

to the marshmallow cotillion.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<line>
Yeah, or because I snorted up

all the magic fairy glitter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<line>
[deep voice] "This summer:

Dumbass Unicorn."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
[chuckles] That's so stupid.

No, that's exactly what they'd do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<line>
It would be like

"Nasty Unicorn: The Unicorn Who Parties."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<line>
[normal voice] Yeah, and his horn

is like a corkscrew,

and he tries to open a bottle of wine,

but it gets stuck,

so now he's got this wine bottle

on his head,

just dripping wine down his face,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
-like... [grunting]

-[laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<line>
"Nasty Unicorn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<line>
He puts the 'U' in 'Eff you.'"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<line>
Okay, but it wouldn't be "Nasty Unicorn."

It would be "Horny Unicorn"!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<line>
Oh, shit, that's amazing.

Now we have to do it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<line>
[chuckles] What do you mean "do it"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<line>
The movie. You're the Horny Unicorn.

I'll direct. We're doing it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<line>
Yeah. I'm not really the guy

people wanna see in movies right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<line>
Yeah, they don't wanna see you

be <i>Secretariat</i> or raising orphans.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
But they will see you be a rude dude

who says all the things polite society

is too limp-dicked to say.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<line>
This is your way back in.

This is how you get that love back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<line>
"The Horny Unicorn"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<line>
Yeah, 'cause deep down, he's wounded.

He's misunderstood.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<line>
It's not his fault he's the way he is!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<line>
-And people are gonna see that!

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<line>
Yeah! He's like, "Hey, buddy!

I never asked to be the horny unicorn!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<line>
What? You think I like it that

I gotta jizz rainbows every 20 minutes

to keep my horn from going soft?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<line>
[chuckles] I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<line>
Come on. I know you need the money.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<line>
When are you gonna stop

punishing yourself?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<line>
[video game noises]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<line>
Flip it. No, you gotta... [sighs]

Flip the thing. Flip it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<line>
Hey, Sonny, do you know

where the advance copy of my book is?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<line>
Your stupid book about the mall?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<line>
Haven't seen it.

'Cause I would never even notice it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<line>
-'Cause it's for losers. Girl losers.

-[laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<line>
You can just say losers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<line>
Girls can be losers without specifying

that they're girls.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<line>
Will you let me know if you see it?

I need to get revisions to my publisher.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<line>
[chuckles] Sounds like a "you" problem.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<line>
[sniggering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<line>
Girl loser.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<line>
-[piano music playing]

-[indistinct chatter]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<line>
-Hello.

-We're here for the party?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<line>
We brought a plant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<line>
Uh, just one sec.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<line>
I'm starting to think smart phones

are actually making us less connected.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<line>
-They are!

-Well, that's politics for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<line>
-It is!

-Hey, man. Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<line>
-What's going on?

-We're here for the party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<line>
We brought a plant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<line>
Look... [sighs] BoJack,

don't make me ask you to leave.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<line>
-You don't have to--

-Come on, dude. Let us in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<line>
-This plant's heavy as tits.

-I don't want a whole thing here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
My mom is coming

and I haven't spoken to her in ten years,

and I can't risk anything happening.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<line>
What do you think is going to "happen"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<line>
I don't know, man,

but something always happens with you

and usually I've been cool because I know

you're always dealing with your own shit,

but I can't risk it tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<line>
I'm sober. Nothing is going to happen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<line>
Yeah, bro, what do you think's gonna--

Oh, shit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<line>
Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<line>
I'll see you around.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<line>
We spent like 30 bucks on that plant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<line>
Yes, I have made mistakes. So, now what?

I'm just supposed to go away forever?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<line>
I'm sorry, but that's bullshit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<line>
This is where you find out

who your real friends are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<line>
Part of being sober is leaving behind

all the people

who can't stop seeing you as the person

who pissed in the fountain

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<line>
-at my own daughter's sweet 16.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
You think you owe them something

because they tolerated you at your worst,

but these people enjoy seeing you fail

because it lets them feel superior.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<line>
They don't know how to process it

when you're no longer the huge screw-up

who hijacked a Meals On Wheels van

to bring my friends to a strip club.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />

<line>
-I don't know--

-I do. You know what else I know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<line>
You gotta go where the love is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<line>
Yeah. Maybe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
That's why we gotta make "Horny Unicorn."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<line>
Because it's gonna make a billion dollars

and drive all those assholes crazy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
It would be good to have something

to keep me busy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
See? That's what I'm talking about!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<line>
-There he is! There's my Horn-corn!

-[phone buzzing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
-Ah, shit. My daughter's in trouble.

-What is it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<line>
You mind if we swing by EWE.S.C.

real quick?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
EWE.S.C.? I'm trying to keep

a low profile.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<line>
-I don't think a college campus--

-BoJack, this is my daughter, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<line>
She's the one person I care about,

the one thing keeping me sober.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<line>
-Why do you need me to go with you?

-Unbelievable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<line>
When everyone else abandoned you,

who was there for you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<line>
When the world judged you

and ridiculed you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<line>
And now, the one time

I need something from you...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
Okay. I'm in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<line>
Or as the horny unicorn would say,

"Am I in?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<line>
Oh, you're in, baby!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<line>
[video game noises]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<line>
No. No. Come on, come on,

come on! Come on!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<line>
-What the hell, Diane?

-Ah! I'm working! I'm just taking a break.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<line>
-Oh, you found my book?

-Yeah, and it sucked. Totally unrealistic.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
-You read my book?

-I've been reading it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<line>
Obviously, I wasn't gonna say it

in front of my friends,

because it's a book for girl babies,

but anyways it didn't even make sense!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<line>
What do you mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<line>
Like, you say the book takes place

in Chicago, but Ivy lives in Schaumburg.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<line>
Schaumburg, Diane?

Schaumburg's not Chicago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
It's in the Chicago metropolitan--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<line>
Oh, my God, what's next?!

Evanston, Chicago?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
Morton Grove, Chicago?

Naperville, Chicago?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<line>
-That's what you sound like!

-Okay, it's not too late to change it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<line>
Good. And while you're at it,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<line>
-I've got some other questions.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<line>
Like, okay. When Ivy told Moose

that he wasn't her best friend anymore

and Moose said,

"You're still <i>my</i> best friend

whether you like it or not..." [sniffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<line>
-was that real?

-What do you mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<line>
Like, did that really happen,

that someone could be

someone's best friend still

even when they're disappointed in them?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
Um, yeah, Sonny, that's real.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<line>
Okay. And you know how Ivy

kept her dad's watch in her locker

because even though he wasn't around

she still knew that he loved her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<line>
-Was that real, too?

-Well, the book is fiction.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<line>
Yeah, no, I get it, I just...

parts of it felt real, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<line>
Yeah. I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<line>
It's cool that you wrote a book.

I mean, I think girls are gonna like it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<line>
Especially girls who, like,

don't have good self-esteem.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
-I hope so.

-So, when's the next one coming out?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<line>
Just in case you need me to check it

for other mistakes, you know. [sniffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<line>
Well, if I get started right away,

it should be out by next fall.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<line>
-Cool. You gotta flip it.

-Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<line>
-Jagger! Jagger!

-Shh, shh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<line>
Hey, hey, hey, keep it down maybe?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<line>
Oh, my God, Dad,

is this seriously happening?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<line>
-Why are you here?

-You knew what you were doing

when you liked

your mother's Instagram post

of her on the beach

with her new boyfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<line>
-What?

-It was a good picture!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<line>
That's why we're here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<line>
Every month,

you get five Instagram likes on my account

and five on your mother's account.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<line>
You heard what the judge mandated!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<line>
Hey, man, let's just go. Okay?

People are starting to--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<line>
-Are you BoJack Horseman?

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<line>
-Yeah, you are.

-NoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<line>
Were you trying to get my attention?

'Cause you got it now, baby!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<line>
-Dad!

-The story got picked up by TMZ!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<line>
You're ruining my life!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<line>
You're making me look like

a real cuck, Jagger.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<line>
I'm getting cucked by my own daughter!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<line>
You don't even know what that word means!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<line>
I just want you to know,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<line>
-I think you got a real bum deal.

-Oh, yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<line>
You got massively sandbagged

in that interview, bro.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<line>
-You were trying to apologize.

-Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<line>
Everything these days is all

"patriarchy" this and "male gaze" that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
And, well, I think it's cool

 you're pushing back against that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<line>
Well, no, I'm not pushing back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<line>
No, Bo, I'm saying it's cool.

You can relax here. This is a safe space.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<line>
-Okay.

-You're embarrassing me!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
Oh, yeah? How's this for embarrassing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<line>
Your last spon-con post for L'Oréal?

It came off as disingenuous!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<line>
[gasps] You know I love my wide array

of L'Oréal products!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
From game days with the gals

to cram sessions at the creamery,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<line>
L'Oréal gives me the confidence

to shine my brightest!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<line>
Do you wanna come back to Delta House?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
I think those guys

would be super-stoked to meet you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<line>
-They'd be stoked?

-Super-stoked.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<line>
All right, let's get out of here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<line>
My daughter sucks, which is surprising

because I did such a good job raising her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<line>
Let's make one more stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<line>
-Hey! Looking good!

-Well, that's politics for you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<line>
[phone buzzes, beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<line>
-Hello?

-Your mother isn't feeling well.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<line>
She's still recovering from her surgery.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<line>
Does that mean you're not coming

to my refined, upscale party

that I totally didn't just throw together

only to impress you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<line>
I'm sorry, uh, no.

But thank you for inviting us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<line>
Jorge, I'm trying to connect to her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<line>
I know. Please keep trying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<line>
[beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<line>
I'm starting to think that smart phones

are actually making us less connected.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<line>
And then I passed out in the pool.

Sploosh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
Luckily, Lindsay Lohan was there

to perform CPR.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<line>
She still credits me for being the reason

she got sober... that time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<line>
[chuckles] Wow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<line>
-Who's Lindsay Lohan?

-She's a celebrity from the olden days.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<line>
Olden days? Jesus.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />

<line>
Hey, look, buddy, I gotta go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
I'm gonna walk this co-ed back

to her room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />

<line>
'Cause, you know, there's pervs out there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<line>
Are you serious?

You're supposed to be my sponsor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<line>
So, what, I gotta hang out

with you all the time?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<line>
Relax, okay? I'll call you tomorrow,

we'll set up "Horny Unicorn."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<line>
Enjoy your people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>

<line>
-Delete that.

-Come on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<line>
Hey, no. You come on.

I'm not here to be your cool story later.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<line>
Okay, sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<line>
I shouldn't be here.
