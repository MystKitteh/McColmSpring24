[Mr. Peanutbutter]

<i>If there's one thing I've learned</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
<i>from this crazy mambo called life,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<p>
<i>it's that anyone can be a birthday father,</i>

<i>but it takes a heart full of birthdays</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<p>
<i>to be a true Birthday Dad.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
<i>-♪ Got a heart full of birthday-- ♪</i>

-[Mr. Peanutbutter] Stop! Go back!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<p>
There it is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<p>
-[snoring]

-Please tell me you guys see that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
Oh! Loo-- looks great! Uh, love it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
What's wrong with your face?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<p>
I just don't buy it,

Director Flea Daniels.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
That just doesn't look like the honest,

trustworthy face of a Birthday Dad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
This is clearly the face

of a guy who did something terrible,

like, I don't know,

cheat on his girlfriend

with his ex-wife a couple of times,

and instead of confessing

to his girlfriend, asked her to marry him,

so now they're engaged,

and she still has no idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
Can't you see he's racked with guilt?

 It's all over his very handsome face!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
Did Birthday Dad cheat on his girlfriend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<p>
No, I'm just saying he looks like he did.

We have to re-edit the scene.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<p>
No. You've been dragging this out

with your ridiculous tweaks and demands

for what is the stupidest premise

I've ever seen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
I gotta go prep my next film,

<i>The Diary of Anne Frankenstein.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<p>
-<i>Birthday Dad</i> is over.

-Huh? No, I'm over!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<p>
Over the moon about continuing to work

on this project!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
-Go home.

-[door opens]

<p>
Wha-- [sighs]

Hey, do you wanna keep hanging out?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<p>
Let's go raid a greeting-card aisle

and come up with our next project!

</p>

<p>

<i>Officer Mike Condolences,</i>

<p>
<i>President Blank Inside!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:33" />

<p>
Uh, I should probably get home to my baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<p>
Oh! Congrats on your new baby...

is another great idea for a movie!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<p>
[exhales] Yeah. Sounds like fun.

<p>
{\an8}Would you stay if I named her Renata?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<p>
{\an8}I understand you are very respected

in your field, so I ask you this:

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:14" />

<p>
{\an8}would you work for a client

who has no regard for your time,

<p>
{\an8}your personal boundaries,

and your general well-being?

Yes, that's all my clients.

<p>
{\an8}so I'll make this quick.

</p>

{\an8}I'm making a list of people

I need to apologize to.

<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
-Oh?

-<i>Yeah.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

And I don't wanna waste your time

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
How thoughtful.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
{\an8}But do you remember the name

of that assistant from, like, 20 years ago

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<p>
{\an8}who I screamed at for bringing me

a room-temp Capri Sun

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<p>
{\an8}and told to quit the business?

Whatever happened to that guy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Derek? I think he quit the business.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
{\an8}So, I gave him good advice, then?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
{\an8}Hey, what do you think of Riley

for a girl's name?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<p>
No good. I slept with a Riley once.

Didn't end well.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<p>
-How about--

-Maybe you should not ask me

about any women's names.

I need you to clear my schedule

for the day.

<p>
My number one priority

is finding a new nanny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
Uh-huh. Also, I was supposed to remind you

about the <i>Manatee Fair</i> photo shoot

for the "Hollywoo Women

Who Do It All" issue.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
Oh, yeah. When is that happening?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
-Right now.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
-I was supposed to remind you yesterday.

-[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn, why am I not looking

at your pretty kitty face

at my photo shoot, so I can decide later

which parts to retouch?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<p>
-I don't think I can make it, Amanda.

-Too bad. Vanessa Gekko's here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<p>
Gekko? Well, that's fine if Vanessa needs

to get the word out

about her struggling business,

but I'm too busy doing it all

to pose for a photo

of "Women Who Do It All."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<p>
Well, sure, I know that,

and you know that, but does the industry?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
I've got two words for you: Karen Kitada.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
[Princess Carolyn]

<i>The creator of </i>Med School Nights?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<p>
[Amanda] <i>Karen Kitada created</i>

<i>the number one show on network television</i>

<p>
<i>and its spin-off,</i>

<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
<i>Everyone wanted to work with her,</i>

<i>everyone!</i>

</p>

<p>
<i>She had more overall deal offers</i>

<i>than an OshKosh B'gosh outlet.</i>

</p>

<p>
<i>-Then a baby fell out of her!</i>

<i>-</i>[Princess Carolyn] <i>Well, that's--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
[Amanda]<i> She took three weeks off.</i>

<i>Three weeks!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
<i>And when she came back,</i>

Tumbleweeds, Crickets...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
<i>And those are just two of the projects</i>

<i>she wasn't offered</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<p>
<i>because the studios were dubious</i>

<i>about her priorities.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<p>
-Do <i>you </i>have the right priorities?

-Of course I do!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
Then prove it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>

<p>
I just think of myself as having multiple

apps running at the same time.

</p>

I have my mom app, and my career app,

and my wife app, and my yoga body app,

<p>
I haven't even had a spare minute

<p>
It's a lot of pressure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
I don't want my daughter to resent me

for the rest of her life

because I named her

something stupid like...

<p>
[stammers] Light Socket.

<p>
And what have you been working on

that's been keeping you so busy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
We just locked picture on <i>Birthday Dad</i>

with Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<p>
That sounds awfully masculine.

-Dad, mister...

-Nut?

-Pean?

-Right, but I'm producing it, so...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
Strong independent woman. Doing it all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
Oh, it sounds like you're doing-it-all

for yourself,

but the new doing it all

is doing it all for other women.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
Oh, yeah, well, the twist

about <i>Birthday Dad</i> is the women

have equal screen time to the men

in the movie,

and the same number of birthdays!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<p>
-Very subversive.

-Less man. More Leslie Mann.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
Cut out what you need to.

If it makes sense, that's a bonus.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
Gotta go!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<p>
Ladies, we have got to find time

to connect like this more often.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<p>
This is so empowering.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
We could put together

a kind of low-key salon

where women exchange ideas

and support each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
With bagels!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
I'd be more than happy to host,

and take care of the caterer, and emcee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
You know, it all!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
-I'll co-host!

-In that case, why not blow it out?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
-Let's make it an event.

-Oh, well--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn, VIM has that massive

foyer that never has anyone waiting in it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<p>
-[gasps] You could finally put it to use!

-We could.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
Move that. That's too close to the wall.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
And I happen to know the Fugees

have been looking for the right time

to do a reunion concert.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<p>
Should I call Lauryn? Hill?

I call her Lauryn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<p>
A concert? Well, that'll take some time

to put together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
Bring it on a little bit. Move it up

a quarter of an inch. Do you mind?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
Since it's on your turf,

I'll focus on the big-picture stuff

and leave all the organization

and planning to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
-I wouldn't wanna step on your toes.

-We wouldn't want that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<p>
-Thanks for stepping up, Princess Carolyn.

-Uh-huh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<p>
[photographer] Okay! Watch the birdie!

-[wearily] Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
Just wanted to give you

a super quick update

on all the dietary restrictions

for the Do-It-Al-Ball.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
It's a ball now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<p>
A ball, a gala,

whatever you wanna call it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
It was just supposed to be a bagels.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
Bagels. Balls. Is this really the Lauryn

you want to die on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
-What?

-Sorry, I meant hill. I call her Lauryn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
[giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
Maybe I should call you back

when I can write this down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<p>
-I'm--

-The Fugees are in, and they love fruit,

especially Fuji apples,

but they're not fans of Fiji water.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
Fuji for the Fugees, but no Fiji.

Got it. [shushes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
Marian is a vegetarian, Meagan is vegan,

and Carrie and a few other luminaries,

like Gerwig and Larson, won't eat dairy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<p>
Cloister the oysters,

say ta-ta to the tartare,

make sure there's no feta for Greta

or brie for Brie!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
Perfect. Is that a fussy baby I hear?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<p>
Here's a little trick I learned.

<p>
Diane, hey!

Look, now isn't really the best time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
I came up with a bunch more

great baby names

while I was interviewing

this boring senator.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
-Huh?

-Okay, but--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<p>
Jacinda, like the New Zealand

prime minister

who had a baby while in office.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
Or what about Ravital,

which is Hebrew for an abundance of dew.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
Is it weird I haven't picked a name yet?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
Ah! Don't worry about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
My parents didn't name me until I was four

and I turned out great, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
-Right?

-Listen, I gotta go. Bye!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<p>
Wait! What about Lucretia? [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
So, you were saying your wife

went missing in this wheat field?

<p>
Move the vase over there.

Those flowers are dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn, the band changed

their mind about the apples.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<p>
They'd prefer sweeter ones for this event.

But they're okay with Fiji if it's frigid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
Okay, I follow so far.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<p>
For this gala, Gala apples over Fuji

for the Bee Gees-- I mean, Fugees.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<p>
But we have to keep their Fujis frigid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
-Got it.

-No, their Fijis frigid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<p>
Right. That's what I meant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
Also, it turns out Marian is pescatarian,

and Meagan is no longer vegan,

but she is refusing to sit

next to Chrissy Teigen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<p>
And now Carrie eats just dairy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
Okay. Marian - pescatarian.

Meagan - not vegan,

but does hate Teigen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
-Carrie loves dairy. Got it.

-[phone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<p>
Gala for the gala,

but Fugees like Fiji and frigid Fuji--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
-Fiji! Fish!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

-And how's my favorite client?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<p>
It's me. I stole Mr. Peanutbutter's phone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
I had to-- Wait. Is Mr. Peanutbutter

your favorite client?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
Let's circle back on that.

What's goin' on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<p>
Your "favorite client" just showed up

at my rehab

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
-for the friends and family meeting.

-The what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<p>
Not important. But can you please

come collect your "favorite client"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<p>
-Yeah. Hang tight.

<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

-Okay.

<p>
-[shouts] What did you do to my film?

-We had to make some edits.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<p>
You mixed all the flashbacks together

with the present-day scenes,

the relationships are incomprehensible,

we don't even know how Birthday Dad dies!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<p>
Audiences are sophisticated.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
We don't need to spell everything out

for them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />

<p>
It's 42 minutes long, and it ends

in the middle of a sentence!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
-Leaving room for a sequel!

-I ain't got time for this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
I'm prepping a sensitive

coming-of-age movie

about a young girl in hiding,

built out of the reanimated corpses

of other young girls in hiding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<p>
In spite of everything, me still believe

people good, fire bad!

<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<p>
Not now, Chloë Grace.

-You can still--

-No. Deuces. I'm outta here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
As the Nazi scientists learn

in my new film that I'm just now realizing

is in possibly poor taste,

you can take something apart

<p>
-So here I am, digging a hole--

-Fiji-- Oh, excuse me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<p>
I have to pick up my Peanutbutter

at Pastiches

and get back to Fiji for the Bee Gees--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<p>
I mean Fuji for the Mujis.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
Your arm looks pretty ripped up.

Is that all from needles?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<p>
Yeah, my baby's needles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<p>
Uh, listen, we're about to go

have some chamomile tea

and do a little guided meditation.

Why don't you join us?

<p>
Keep up the good work

with all those charming memes!

</p>

I love the one where the boyfriend

is looking at the other lady

and his girlfriend turns to him

with this expression of tremendous pain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<p>
How could this man, who claims

to love her, betray her so flagrantly?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<p>
That is a very sad meme.

<p>
-Uh... okay. Bye, Pickle Pack!

-[phone beeps]

<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<p>
-What is going on?

-What do you mean?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<p>
You've been acting different.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<p>
I first noticed it the night

of the <i>Philbert</i> premiere,

when you came home late

smelling like Diane,

and then after a while,

things went back to normal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<p>
But then you got real weird again

right around that time

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
BoJack went to rehab.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
Right before you proposed that day,

you also smelled like Diane. [sniffs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
-Oh, my God. I get what's happening.

-Pickles--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
-You feel guilty.

-You're right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
-I feel so guilty because I chea--

-Because your good friend's in rehab.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<p>
Chiefly feel guilty because

my good friend's in rehab, like you said.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
Why don't you go visit him

if this is the thing

that's been weighing on you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
It is. The one thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<p>
-BoJack Horseman...

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<p>
-...and Mr. Peanutbutter in the same room?

-Oh, God, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<p>
-This can't be happening. Um...

-What is this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
Hello! Are you here

for the friends and family meeting?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<p>
-No--

-You're the first friend

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<p>
-that BoJack's invited.

-I don't even remember getting invited.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<p>
-I did not invite--

-I'm proud of you, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<p>
-Hey, I'm Doctor Champ.

-Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<p>
-[BoJack groans]

-Hey! Your name's Mister?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<p>
-My name's Doctor!

-How about that!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
Wait, is Doctor Champ just your name?

Are you not a doctor?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
Five-minute warning everyone.

Five minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<p>
Come on, BoJack,

let's get some good seats!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<p>
-[chuckles]

-We're sitting in a circle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
They're all good seats.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
How can I make up for all the lies,

the stealing, the cheating?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
She says we can make a fresh start,

but is that even possible?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<p>
-Hmm...

-[indistinct chattering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<p>
I'm sorry, can we go back to the cheating?

Did you tell her about that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<p>
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter, we don't interrupt

when others are sharing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<p>
Just looking for a little context.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
Why don't you go looking in your car?

Maybe you left it there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<p>
BoJack, don't interrupt

Mr. Peanutbutter, he's sharing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<p>
-No. But he--

-But, but, but. Butts are for cigarettes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<p>
Thank you, Doctor Champ.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<p>
As I was saying, I think Doug

needs to be honest with his wife

before they can move forward.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<p>
-[all] Mmm.

-You're right. I need to tell her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<p>
But on the other hand,

maybe that's just your guilt talking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<p>
Isn't it sometimes better to let

sleeping dogs lie?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:32" />

<p>
I-I assume your fiancée is a dog?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
She's my wife, and she's human.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<p>
Okay, so your fiancée.

Let's say her name is... Pickles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
-Wait, uh...

-She doesn't know,

and she's happy not knowing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
Wouldn't telling her now

just cause additional pain?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<p>
-[all] Uh-huh.

-So, it's better not to tell her?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<p>
Oh, well, that's really convenient

for you, Doug!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
-No, I didn't--

-Hey, everyone, look at "Doug"

deciding that the best option

just happens to be the one

where he doesn't get in trouble!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<p>
-Mr. Peanutbutter--

-But that's just Doug all over, isn't it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<p>
Classic, stupid, selfish,

inconsiderate Doug!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<p>
[indistinct chattering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<p>
Wow. Those are harsh words.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<p>
But I needed to hear them. Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
Look, I don't know

what's going on with you,

although I'm pretty sure either you

or Doug cheated on Pickles,

but I understand that feeling of needing

to bottle up your guilt,

not burden other people with it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<p>
-Yeah?

-You think you're protecting them

from your toxicity, you convince yourself

that you're being selfless, but...

it comes out in other ways

and it infects everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
I could use a drink.

Is there a bar in here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<p>
So, then I said, "No. It's rehab."

And then he left. That was two days ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
Two days ago? Oh, my God, the gala!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<p>
Yeah, and you're probably worried

about your baby, too, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<p>
Oh, my God, my baby!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<p>
[line ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
Come on, Todd.

Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
Hey! I was wondering if I'd hear

from you Todd-day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<p>
Yes-Todd-Day, I thought,

"Maybe I'll hear from her Todd-morrow!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<p>
Is Untitled Princess Carolyn Project okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<p>
-She sure is.

-Oh, thank God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<p>
<i>Wait, you're talking about</i>

<i>Untitled Princess Carolyn Project,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<p>
<i>the baby, right?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<p>
Who else would I be talking about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
Well...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
-Mr. Knickerbocker will see you now.

-Great!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<p>
[phone ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<p>
Oh, hold on one second.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
-[phone beeps]

-Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
Todd, I have to go to a photo shoot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
I need you to take the baby

for an hour or so.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<p>
Well, you know how much I love hanging out

with Untitled Princess Carolyn Project,

but I can't Todd-day

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
-because of all these meetings I have.

-[snores]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
But if my schedule weren't so busy,

I'd say...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<p>
-[pop]

-"Sure, I'd be happy to."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<p>
-Great. I'll see you at VIM in 15 minutes.

-[baby crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
-Um... okay?

-[phone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<p>
I'll be right back.

[pants] Sorry about that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<p>
[phone rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<p>
-Hello?

-Todd, change of plans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
Bring the baby over to me

at SmashFox Studios.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
Okay, he had to cancel another meeting

but he will see you now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
-I'll be right back.

-[baby cries]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<p>
I'm going to level with you, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<p>
You making me wait made me angry,

and that made me respect you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<p>
Sorry, things have just been a little

hectic since I've been helping out

with Untitled Princess Carolyn Project.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<p>
"Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"?

I'm intrigued.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<p>
-You think the project has legs?

-Yeah, she has legs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
I'm thrilled to meet you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<p>
The whole town is buzzing

about "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
Weird, but okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<p>
We need something big.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
Is "Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"

the kind of thing

that makes a lot of noise?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<p>
She sure does!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
I'm in. Name your price.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
Jonathan?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
We took a big swing

with Dick Wolf's Milwaukee shows.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
Turns out audiences are not interested

in a whole night of Milwaukee,

so now we've got some slots to fill.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
Do you think

"Untitled Princess Carolyn Project"

could live for several seasons?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<p>
I don't see how those things are related,

but I certainly hope so!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
-Well, how can I help?

-You wanna help?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
Let's start with a two-season pick up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
Yeah, sure, pick-up, drop-off,

whatever works best for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<p>
-That would be great.

-Great!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
[baby giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
Well, here she is.

What time do you want me to pick her up?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
Wait, it's a baby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
-And she has legs!

-[coos]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<p>
I already canceled

<i>Milwaukee Waste Management.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<p>
I told the shareholders

this was gonna save the network!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
{\an8}-We designed the poster!

-[coos]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
Todd, we need a show. We can't air a baby!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<p>
[blows raspberry]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
So, long story short,

Pinky canceled the baby,

but now we owe him a TV show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
So, the show is called <i>Birthday Dad.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
The pilot was directed by Flea Daniels,

and the show will be run by Karen Kitada.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
The creator of <i>Med School Nights?</i>

And <i>Med School Nights: The New Class,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
<i>Med School Nights Goes to Law School?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<p>
-Uh...

-This show's about a dad

who died on his birthday,

and every episode,

his spirit visits a different

intersectionally representative person

on their birthday

to help them work

through their own issues.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
But how are all these characters related?

When does the show take place?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
How does Birthday Dad die?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
Those are mysteries we'll tease

all season!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
-Uh-huh.

<i>-Birthday Dad,</i> you'll laugh, you'll cry,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<p>
-you'll Birthday Dad!

-What do you think?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
Yeah, like I said, we'll take anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
[phone ringing, beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
-Yeah?

<i>-</i>[BoJack] <i>Hey.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<p>
Um, so, I don't wanna waste any more

of your time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
I just wanted to say that I know

you're really busy

and I'm sorry for making your life

more difficult this week and also always.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<p>
Also, I know that my apologies

are pretty much meaningless at this point,

and I'm sorry for that, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
Why didn't you tell me

about the <i>Friends and Family Meetings?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
I don't know. You got so much goin' on,

I didn't wanna bother you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
I would have come.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
Okay. Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
[elevator dings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<p>
[pants] Did I miss it?

Is the Do-It-All-Ball all done?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
Yes. We did it all.

Good of you to show up, by the way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<p>
Oh, yeah? Well, it's good of you to, uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<p>
Shut up!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
Are you okay?

You're not your usual medium-clever self.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<p>
Can I ask you something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<p>
So, there's work, right?

I mean, work makes sense to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
And I'm good at it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<p>
I don't feel that way about my baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
I don't think

I'm feeling what I'm supposed to feel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<p>
What I thought I would feel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<p>
I mean, I love her, of course I do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<p>
Of course I love my daughter.

But... [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<p>
But I don't know if I <i>love </i>her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<p>
I know I'm a terrible person

for even thinking it,

but... what if it never happens?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<p>
Do you love all your clients' projects?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<p>
-Of course.

-No, you don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<p>
But you take care of them

and you keep them alive

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
-because that's your job, right?

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<p>
So, now you've got a new job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<p>
And it is a ruthless one,

and I mean ruthless.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<p>
You don't have time to waste

second-guessing how you feel about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<p>
You just have to do it

the best that you can,

and know that that's the best you can do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<p>
You know,

[scoffs] we have so much in common.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:17" />

<p>
I don't know why we've spent

so many years hating each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:20" />

<p>
I never hated you. Did you hate me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:23" />

<p>
Uh... no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<p>
[cries]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<p>
Hey. [shushes] Hey. Please. Listen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<p>
-Did you get the Fijis for the Fugees?

-[giggling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:34" />

<p>
Yeah. Is that silly?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:37" />

<p>
The Fugees were egregious

when they got interviewed by Regis.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:41" />

<p>
[both giggling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:44" />

<p>
Isn't that right...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:46" />

<p>
-Ruthie?
