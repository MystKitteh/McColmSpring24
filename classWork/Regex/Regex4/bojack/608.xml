-[waves crashing]

-[bell tolling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<line>
A hummingbird smiled at me

on my walk this morning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
In small pleasures such as this,

I'm reminded of the presence of the Lord.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<line>
-As you ought.

-And yet...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<line>
-No.

-Out with it, Sister Marguerite.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
To hesitate is to waste time,

which is a sin when time

could be elsewise spent in prayer,

or handwashing Monsignor Toscani's

1962 Alfa Romeo,

which is itself a form of prayer,

is it not?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<line>
Of course. Yet I find myself consumed

by thoughts of my past.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<line>
You have no past. You've confessed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<line>
Your sins have been washed clean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<line>
This is like day one stuff,

what are we talking about here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<line>
The people I've hurt,

the lives I've ruined,

are they washed clean as well?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<line>
Your regrets are of no benefit

to the Lord.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<line>
Ruminating so is a solipsism unbefitting

a sister of the cloth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<line>
Is it solipsism to be concerned

with the fates of others?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<line>
Perhaps one could argue

cloistering oneself from the world

is itself a form of solipsism.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<line>
[stammers] If one were being ungenerous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<line>
Remember when you first arrived here

and you didn't talk for like two years?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<line>
I will trouble you no further, Mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<line>
Lord, how you challenge me

with so vexing a pupil.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<line>
-[car engine starts]

-Hmm?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<line>
[shouts] What dereliction is this?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:26" />

<line>
When you get to Heaven,

look up Margo Martindale!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<line>
I won't be there, but my movies will!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:33" />

{\an8}[theme music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:30" />

<line>
{\an8}I wanna know what's changed

since the strike.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:32" />

<line>
Are assistants treated better or have

things reverted to business as usual?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<line>
{\an8}Yeah, give me ten inches.

I also want a roast beef sub.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<line>
{\an8}-Six inches.

-[woman] <i>Paige Sinclair is on her way up.</i>

-Ah, shit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:42" />

<line>
She's the best reporter

this building's ever seen,

but, goddamn,

is that woman a pain in the ass.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<line>
[Paige] Colleagues!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:48" />

<line>
Your eyes do not deceive!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:49" />

<line>
You may find my gown overly formal

for the workplace,

but that is because I am, as of today

formerly a member

of this vaulted institution.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<line>
As I'm to be wed tonight

and the newsroom is no room

for a domesticated woman,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:59" />

<line>
-I bid you farewell.

-[man screams]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<line>
Okay, goodbye.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<line>
Yes, mine was a storied run

as the star reporter for "The Reporter."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<line>
"Front Page Paige," they called me!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<line>
-Well, we'll miss you, Paige.

-Indeed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<line>
My shoes don't fill easy,

my left foot striking a more robust

silhouette than her starboard sister.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<line>
{\an8}But I cannot prolong my engagement.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
{\an8}After all, time, as they say,

is a river without banks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<line>
{\an8}Time may not have banks,

but this periodical certainly does.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<line>
Maximillian Banks, at my service!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<line>
[scoffs] Maximilian Banks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<line>
{\an8}I may lack your nose for news,

but I've got an eyeball for a highball!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<line>
{\an8}Why, this man couldn't

string together two clauses

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<line>
{\an8}without ending on a preposition.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<line>
{\an8}I don't know what you're referring to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<line>
You could fill a library

with all the things you don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<line>
In fact, they do.

They call them libraries.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<line>
Guys, we're trying to work here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<line>
No matter, I shan't be staying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<line>
My sweet betrothed, Baxter Bellamy,

awaits with champagne

to chauffeur me directly to my nuptials,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<line>
{\an8}and I didn't think I'd visit long,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<line>
{\an8}so I left him in the car

with the windows up. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
Good, I've got business

to attend to as well.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
{\an8}I'll have you know it's almost time

for my mid-morning confabulation

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
{\an8}with a former stage mother to the stars,

Mrs. Carol Himmelfarb-Richardson.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
You've been taking those phone calls?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<line>
Yes, she is as loony as a Canadian dollar,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<line>
{\an8}but she is a scintillating

conversationalist.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<line>
Oh? What about the conversation 

scintillates?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
She calls every day to see if we have

any information on her dead daughter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
-The answer's always no.

-Sounds like a scoop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<line>
It's not. It's a pop star who overdosed.

Open-and-shut case.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<line>
-All the better for opening and shutting.

-Why do you have that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
{\an8}Baxter, my boy,

my dear sweet beautiful bridegroom,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<line>
{\an8}best put the champagne on ice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<line>
I've got a story that simply demands

my attention

and I just couldn't marry you

before it's settled.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<line>
{\an8}I'd only be distracted,

which isn't fair to you or me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, darling, I've already committed

to being your wife.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<line>
What, you need to hear a few measly words?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<line>
Well, "I do." Does that satisfy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<line>
I do, I do, I do,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<line>
{\an8}and I do want you

to wait for me to ring you again shortly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<line>
{\an8}[snorts] I knew you'd understand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
Oh. Mm! [snorts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
Now, as to the girl.

I smell beans. Spill 'em.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<line>
The girl's name was Sharon Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<line>
{\an8}It's Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<line>
{\an8}Hmm...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
<i>♪ Don't you touch my prickly muffin ♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<line>
{\an8}Did you ever notice that this music video

takes place in a planetarium,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<line>
{\an8}-and Sarah Lynn died in a planetarium?

-Huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<line>
-Uh... Hey, Tawnie.

-[music stops]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<line>
Are we going to this party?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
I didn't come all the way down

to Manhattan

to just watch you watch your boyfriend

be on the internet

at his parents' fancy house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<line>
{\an8}Don't parent-shame him, Hollyhock.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
{\an8}It's not Trey's fault he grew up

in an Upper Westside brownstone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<line>
{\an8}Also, I'm not her boyfriend.

We're uncomplicated like that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<line>
Come on! We're missing the party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<line>
{\an8}What? No. If we show up before 2:00,

everyone's gonna think we're losers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
Fine. But can't we do something else

while we wait? [gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<line>
Let's explore the city!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
-[sighs]

-[siren wailing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
The Big Apple.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
There she is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
Apparently, there's a bar around here

called Hartigan's.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
My cousin and his friends call it

"They-Don't-Cardigan's." I don't get it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<line>
Wow, a real New York bar.

That could be cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
Yeah, a bar! But how often are we

in New York?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<line>
Let's go to the top

of the Empire State Building,

like the big ape

in that movie, <i>Sleepless in Seattle!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
All right! Big building!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<line>
[thunder rumbling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
Lord, we thank You for this bounty-- Ella?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<line>
That place you sent me didn't fix me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<line>
Because I am not a thing to be fixed,

Daddy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<line>
Have a seat. We're havin' bacon-blasted

chicken fingers from Chicken-4-Dayz.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<line>
I'm not staying. I'm going to a place

where the people accept me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<line>
You sit your ass in that chair, Ella,

because that place is right here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<line>
Oh, Daddy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<line>
That's what I wish I'd said.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<line>
I haven't seen Ella in four years,

but every night I bring home dinner,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<line>
I get an extra bucket of bacon-blasted

chicken fingers just for her,

so that if she ever comes home...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<line>
<i>she'll know that she's welcome</i>

<i>at our table.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<line>
Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
Kelsey Jannings,

our little indie film darling,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<line>
I think I speak for both of us

when I say gooba, gooba, hey, yah, yah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<line>
Tears. Feel my cheeks.

Damp cheeks over here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
I do notice it's not

as Chicken-4-Dayz-focused

as maybe it seemed in the outline stage?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
Talk us through your journey there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<line>
What do you want?

You want a close-up of the bucket?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
Ooh, I think that would make it

feel like a commercial,

and what's so innovative

about this content

is that it's not a commercial.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
Right, I forgot about the innovative part

of it. Excuse me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<line>
Our target demo responds poorly

when they feel

they're being advertised to,

but they love stories that engage them

on their level,

utilizing themes of inclusivity,

as well as dunking on the olds.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<line>
Ah, yes, teens love dunking on olds,

is there any way to get more of that in?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<line>
-Well, we already shot the ad.

-Not an ad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
The immersive product placement journey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
But maybe I can find takes

that are in more of a dunking tone,

as well as shots

that highlight more prominently

but do not feature the bucket

of chicken-bacon finger-blasters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<line>
Thank you for letting us help you share

your beautiful vision with the world.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
No. Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<line>
[bicycle bell rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<line>
[scoffs] I'm sorry, it's bullshit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
A gig's a gig.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<line>
And Vassar doesn't accept indie cred

in lieu of my daughter's tuition.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<line>
I just don't believe it.

You're a way better director than I am.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<line>
If you'd told me that one day

you'd be doing chicken commercials--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<line>
-Not a commercial.

-That you'd be doing

sponsored content pre-roll

for <i>Beverly Hillbillies </i>reruns on Gronkle

while I'm directing another

action-adventure blockbuster,

this one set in the world

of competitive ballroom dancing,

working title, "Balls to the Wall,"

if you'd told me that...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:29" />

<line>
You'd be super-stoked?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<line>
Yeah, first, I'd be really stoked,

but then eventually,

I would get around to being outraged.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<line>
-[coughing]

-[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<line>
It is fun that we're both working

on the same lot, though.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<line>
-Right?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<line>
-[cell phone buzzing]

-Sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<line>
-What now?

-[man speaking indistinctly]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<line>
Again? Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<line>
-Yeah. I'll talk to her.

-[phone beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<line>
What are these new pages?

Why do I have new pages?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
You don't like the new pages?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<line>
[groans] The content of the pages

is not the issue, Justin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
-Yeah.

-I spent time preparing the other pages.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<line>
You understand?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
I rehearsed them. I studied them.

That's precious time I'll never get back!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
And then some person--

I don't know this person--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
And by the way, I don't like strange

persons knocking on my door

and then letting themselves in.

The knock is so I can tell you to enter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
If you just enter,

 what is the purpose of the knock?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<line>
You're right, of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<line>
My point is about the pages.

Why are you throwing new things at me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<line>
The insurance guys are nixing

the car chase.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<line>
We had to think fast, so we put together

a new hand-to-hand combat scene

we're gonna throw on top

of the meringue number.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<line>
-So, it's a stunt?

-I thought you'd be excited.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
I'm excited!

It's more time spent on your face.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
Ever since I directed you in that episode

of "FBI: Female Body Inspectors,"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<line>
I thought... [chuckles]

"I gotta give this woman her close-up."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<line>
Don't produce me, Justin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
[sighs] Is there choreography?

When am I learning this stunt?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<line>
April's gonna be on set.

She'll make sure you understand the stunt.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
-And it's gonna be safe?

-We are taking every precaution.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<line>
And we are not gonna shoot

until you are 100 percent comfortable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<line>
Thank you.

I didn't mean to bite your head off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<line>
-I just don't like being surprised, okay?

-Totally my fault.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<line>
I should've warned you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<line>
Is there something else going on

that I should know about?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
I'm fine. I'm actually being

really cool here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<line>
I'm not some kind of monster

just because I don't like surprises.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<line>
I'm number one on the call sheet.

I'm entitled to a little respect.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<line>
No, you're right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<line>
I mean, I've worked on projects

where the number one on the call sheet

was like an actual crazy person,

so I think I'm being really cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<line>
-You are being so cool.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<line>
[Gina] Can you wait

until you're out of earshot

to make your exasperated sighs, please?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<line>
Yes, sorry!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<line>
[jazz music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<line>
[all] Huh? [dogs panting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
[chuckles] Kelsey! You can't

compare yourself to Justin Kenyon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<line>
-What's the difference?

-The difference is he has a great agent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
[chuckles] That was a joke,

but I see you're in no mood.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
I'm a good director.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:48" />

<line>
Yes, but Justin's movies

make actual money.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<line>
The last big movie you were on,

you got fired off of.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<line>
Explain this to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<line>
I didn't break

into the Nixon Library alone

and yet I'm the only one

whose career has suffered.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<line>
Why do you think that is?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<line>
Kelse, I don't know by what fancy

the fates push us about

in their great cosmic dance.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
-I am but an agent.

-What about these stories I keep hearing

about how people wanna hire

more female directors?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<line>
Oh, they want to, they want to so bad.

Just not for this particular project.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
Which particular project?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
Anyone. I mean, you name it.

Whatever Paul Feig's doing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<line>
You need to get me out of director jail.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
Even Roman Polanski works more than I do,

and he should be in actual jail.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
[laughs] Yeah, for his last

couple of movies, at least, right? Woof!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
No. Not for his last couple of movies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<line>
Carol, be a doll and tell this dame

what you told me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<line>
I just don't understand

why my daughter would start using again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<line>
She was sober.

She was going to AA meetings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<line>
You suspect foul play?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
Listen to this,

the last voicemail I ever got from her,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<line>
-a month before she died.

-[beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<line>
[Sarah Lynn] <i>Hey, Mommy.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<line>
I got out of a meeting

and we're making amends,

so I just wanted to say I'm sorry

I'm such a disappointment. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<line>
I'm sorry my platinum records clashed

with the chic minimalism

of your new sun room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
And I'm sorry I didn't introduce you

as my older sister

when we met David Hasselhoff

at the Kids' Choice Awards.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<line>
And I'm sorry I've never been

enough for you, Mommy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
What an angel.

She just wanted me to be happy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<line>
What is the "we"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<line>
-What?

-Yeah! At the beginning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<line>
She says, "We're making amends."

Who's this "we"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
[camera shutter clicking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<line>
You know, we don't have to go

to this party if you don't want to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
What? I'm the one who keeps saying,

"Let's go to the party."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<line>
The only reason I came down here was so

we could go to this party and get drunk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<line>
Come on. I've gone to like

a hundred parties with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<line>
You always say you're gonna drink,

and you never do, which is fine,

by the way!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<line>
No one's ever offered me a drink.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
I keep waiting

for this famous peer pressure

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<line>
I've heard so much about

and it never happens!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<line>
You wanna go have a drink? Here I am,

your peer, pressuring you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<line>
[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<line>
I'm nervous about losing control,

you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<line>
I think drinking alcohol

might not be for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
But I don't wanna be scared of something

that's supposed to be fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<line>
That's why I wanna go to that party

with a bunch of strangers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<line>
Because if I'm gonna lose control, I don't

want it to be in front of people I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
-Okay, weirdo.

-[chuckles] You're a weirdo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<line>
Because I am not a thing to be fixed,

Daddy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<line>
Do you think we should ADR her saying

"Daddy-o"? Is "Daddy-o" more of a dunk?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<line>
-[groans]

-[cell phone rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<line>
-Hello?

-Um, hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<line>
Am I speaking

to the future director of "Fireflame"?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<line>
-What's that?

-"Fireflame"! It's a superhero movie!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<line>
Ugh. Another one?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<line>
Yes, but the difference is this one's

about a lady superhero,

which means this one you could

actually get hired on!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<line>
I don't want them to hire me

just because I'm a woman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<line>
Ugh. You think Justin Kenyon says,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<line>
"I don't want them to hire me

just because I'm a man"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<line>
Of course not! He says, "Money,

money, money. Nom, nom, nom."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<line>
I have heard him say that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<line>
Besides, they don't want this

to be just another superhero movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<line>
They're looking for someone who can make

a superhero movie with a twist!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<line>
So, what, they want me to pitch the twist?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<line>
-No, the twist is that it's a woman.

-Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<line>
But they do wanna hear your take,

by which I mean they want you,

as a woman, to tell them their take.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<line>
Hmm...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<line>
[man] I've been saying for years

as soon as we run out

of popular male characters

and we've given them each two sequels,

we have to make a movie about Fireflame!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<line>
I think that's really edgy

and outside the box.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:38" />

<line>
Outside is exactly where we're trying

to be, in relation to the box.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<line>
We really think Fireflame can connect

with today's Yas Queen culture.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<line>
Yeah, I got a real Yas Queen vibe

from her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
She comes in, she saves the day,

everyone loves her!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<line>
-Wow.

-Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<line>
Didn't I tell you this would make

a great movie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
Uh, pretty sure I told you, Nancy.

I have always loved Fireflame.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<line>
I'm sorry. I remember now,

you did tell me that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<line>
Well, uh, thanks for coming in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<line>
We're obviously gonna hear a lot of takes,

but it seems like you have

a special connection to the material.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<line>
I do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
[elevator dings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<line>
[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<line>
[Paige snorting] Aw. Aha!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<line>
I'm famished. Let's find a place where

I can get a glass with an olive in it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<line>
Try to stay on task, won't you, Maxy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
If Sarah Lynn was going to meetings here,

someone must have seen her,

and if someone saw something,

then I wanna know it,

particularly as it pertains--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:34" />

<line>
What crime have I committed

to deserve so long a sentence?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<line>
I've got a point.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<line>
Once you arrived at it,

send me a postcard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<line>
The starlet was alone

when she died, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<line>
But there was someone else

with her while she was blotto.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<line>
Who was that person? What'd they see?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<line>
And why weren't they mentioned

in the police report?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
There's your who, what and why.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
Get a when and a where in there,

and we've got ourselves a story.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<line>
Bully for you, you're almost caught up

to where I was an hour ago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<line>
Let's chat again in an hour

when you've gotten to where I'm at now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<line>
Sounds good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<line>
In the meantime, someone in this building

might just offer the key

that opens the gate to the garden

with the tree that bears the fruit

that is our scoop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<line>
Get someone to squeal on an AA meeting?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<line>
I do believe one "A"

of the two stands for "anonymous."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<line>
The other "A",

I could not possibly fathom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<line>
I envy your faith in the honor

and discretion of other people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<line>
Let's see how that honor stacks up

against the desire

to dish on celebrities

so as to appear swank by association.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<line>
Excuse me, kind stranger.

I'm writing a story

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<line>
-on the efficacy of your program.

-Uh-huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<line>
I understand one of the pillars

is anonymity, but if you could...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<line>
I once saw Craig Ferguson here!

I don't know why I said that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<line>
[gasps] Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<line>
I really shouldn't say. It's anonymous,

but I have seen Robert Downey, Jr.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<line>
Jamie Lee Curtis winked at me once.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<line>
Colin Farrell, Russell Brand,

the Ikea Monkey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<line>
-Sarah Lynn, I've seen.

-Really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<line>
About a month before she died.

It was pretty clear she was using.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<line>
Well, how do you figure?

Did she say something?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<line>
She didn't, but her friend did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<line>
-Her friend?

-Large fella.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<line>
I think he was a horse

or a bull maybe, it's hard to remember.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<line>
Kind of like a rounder Brad Garrett type,

but with a very forgettable face.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<line>
He told a story, though, I remember that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<line>
It was about a trip he took to...

New Mexico.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<line>
-Oh?

-Yeah, it was about a girl and a mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:13" />

<line>
Oh, this is so long ago now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<line>
I think he had sex with the girl,

or maybe he had sex with the mother?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<line>
Well, do get your story sorted,

but I'd prefer it if it's sordid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<line>
And this man left with Sarah Lynn?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<line>
Do you recall anything else

about this man, his name, perhaps?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
No, but I remember the girl's name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<line>
Yes, Sarah Lynn,

now we're all up to speed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<line>
No, the girl from his story.

The one in New Mexico.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<line>
He was weirdly proud of it,

said her name was Penny Carson.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<line>
Carson, eh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<line>
"Penny Carson," he said. "And that's

her real name, you can look her up!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<line>
I remember thinking,

"Why does he want us to look her up?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:52" />

<line>
[both] Hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<line>
So she's sexy,

but don't you call her sweetheart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<line>
-[laughs] Boy.

-Oh, that is so Fireflame.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<line>
-[yelps]

-Oh, wow!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<line>
-Stop!

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<line>
-I'm sorry, I can't let you--

-Uh, excuse me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:07" />

<line>
Are you already-- Sorry.

I'm sure she's got a great pitch,

but the movie you want,

it's just not realistic.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<line>
Sure it is.

Wendy Wiggum ate fire as a baby

and now she holds the power

of the Fireflame. It's all very logical.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<line>
No, I just mean you're doing this

all wrong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
She saves the day,

and everybody loves her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<line>
I mean, yeah, that makes sense

if she's a man.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<line>
But it's never worked like that for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<line>
Well, this isn't about you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<line>
That's right! It's about an exotic dancer

who's also interdimensional.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<line>
No. I mean the rules are different

for women.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />

<line>
If you're a woman

and you save the day, nobody loves you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<line>
People take you for granted,

or worse, they resent you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<line>
They punish you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
The more powerful you are,

the more they'll take your power away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<line>
And I just think if your movie is smart,

you'll acknowledge that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
-Ooh, yeah, sounds like a bummer.

-Yeah, it's a bummer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<line>
Being a superhero is hard.

Otherwise, everyone would do it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<line>
Okay, well, thank you for--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
Maybe that is a bad superhero movie.

Not aspirational enough, I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
But it's real. And it's different.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<line>
Also, in my version, she's gay. Okay, bye!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>

You're not bad for a beginner.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<line>
Wrong on both counts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

I'm no beginner. And I'm very bad.

Ow! What the hell?

<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

-Cut! Is everyone okay?

-I don't know. Do I have a concussion?

<line>
-You fell like a foot.

-[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<line>
-Why did you drop me?

-Why'd you scream at me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
-Hey, guys--

-I didn't know he was gonna dip me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<line>
-That's not what we rehearsed!

-You said to have fun with it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<line>
I meant fun energy.

I didn't mean change the choreography.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<line>
I can't do this. I am number one

on the call sheet...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<line>
-[overlapping dialogue]

-...and all I ask for is a modicum

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<line>
-Breaking news! She's number one!

-of respect and professionalism.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<line>
Okay, let's everybody cool down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
Do not tell me to cool down

like I'm the crazy person here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<line>
I'm just trying to have

a safe workplace environ--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<line>
I had you.

What the fuck is wrong with you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<line>
-I'm... I'm going home.

-Gina, we need to get this sequence,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<line>
-and we are already behind.

-Not my problem.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<line>
I get that you're mad, and you're

totally right, but everybody else here--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<line>
<i>Not </i>my problem.

<line>
-[man] Oh! What do you see?

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<line>
You're having an anxiety attack, so look

around the room and tell me what you see.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<line>
I-I see people partying and passing out!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<line>
What else do you see?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<line>
Um, books. Pizza boxes.

I see light fixtures.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<line>
I see an odd amount of floor poofs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<line>
-Okay, now say your name.

-Hollyhock.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<line>
-Last name too.

-No, we'll be here all night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
-You feel any calmer?

-Yeah, actually. A little bit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
It's a trick my psychiatrist taught me.

It's supposed to help you ground yourself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
-Thanks.

-Except for the saying your name part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<line>
That's not really part of it.

I just wanted to know your name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<line>
Oh. Okay, cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<line>
I-I'm Peter, by the way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<line>
Just so you don't have to wait for me

to have an anxiety attack too. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<line>
-Hollyhock.

-Yeah, I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<line>
Oh. [chuckles] Right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<line>
So, this party's kind of crowded.

You wanna go get some air?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<line>
Yeah. But it's pretty cold out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<line>
-Oh, yeah, that's true.

-But we're wearing jackets!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
Also true.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<line>
Darling, you must keep the cake cold

and the flowers fresh

for just a moment longer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<line>
This story has revealed itself

to be thornier than a rose bush

and just as sweet. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<line>
When shall I return?

Well, I haven't sorted that out yet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<line>
It seems I've gone

to New Mexico for a spell.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
-[wind howls]

-Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<line>
Well, we're here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<line>
So I wanted to talk to you because

I'm directing a new movie: "Fireflame"!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
"Fireflame"? Get that money.

Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom, nom!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<line>
Yeah. So I need an actress.

Someone tough, but vulnerable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<line>
I know you're working with Gina Cazador.

What do you think of her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
[stammers] Look, if you've seen her work,

you know what she can do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<line>
She's very versatile. Really talented.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
But personality-wise, what's she like?

Is she good to work with?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<line>
I can't risk any drama on set.

There's too much riding on this for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<line>
[sighs] If I'm being honest,

I can't recommend her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<line>
-No?

-Especially if you have a lot of stunts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<line>
I mean, don't get me wrong,

she's great on camera. She just...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
-Uh... She can be a little difficult.

-What do you mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<line>
I don't know what happened.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<line>
I worked with her a couple years ago,

she was great, but, um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<line>
[inhales sharply]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<line>
Oh, you know who'd be perfect?

Courtney Portnoy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<line>
Oh! I love her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
I've heard nothing but good things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<line>
[gulping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<line>
[coughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<line>
It's fine.

You're not even supposed to like it yet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<line>
It tastes okay-er over time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
Yeah, I'm kind of aspiring to be okay-er

over time myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
You know, I actually didn't even drink

for like all of college.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<line>
I had some shit go down

in high school, and...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<line>
You know, there was this girl in my town.

Anyway, it's a long story.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<line>
No, I wanna hear it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<line>
Okay. She had this man

living in her house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
You mean like more than one dad?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<line>
No, no, she had just the one dad,

but then there was this other guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<line>
-Weird.

-Totally weird, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<line>
Okay. So this girl was best friends

with my girlfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<line>
We all went to prom together:

me, my girlfriend, the girl, and the man.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<line>
Wait, the man went to prom with you?

Yeesh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<line>
That's not even the yeesh-iest part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<line>
This guy bought us bourbon

and practically forced us to drink it,

and then when my girlfriend

got alcohol poisoning,

he just ditched us at the ER.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<line>
Was your girlfriend okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<line>
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I mean, it was scary in the moment.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<line>
We were there all night

and they pumped her stomach.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:11" />

<line>
And I was pretty traumatized for a while.

[stammers] But things are good now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<line>
Things are good. Because at some point,

I realized it wasn't the alcohol's fault,

or Maddy's fault, or my fault.

It was just some shitty dude, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<line>
Totally.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<line>
But you know the craziest part of all?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
The guy, he's actually kind of famous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<line>
-Really?

-Yeah, I never heard of him,

but it turns out

he's kind of a movie star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:37" />

<line>
Who is he?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:39" />

<line>
[exhales] Um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:45" />

<line>
Who is he?
