<i>[polite applause]</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:06" />

<p>
<i>[male TV host] When we booked you</i>

<i>for this show,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:08" />

<p>
<i>you'd just won the Triple Crown,</i>

<i>but then just this week,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<p>
<i>I open up the newspaper,</i>

<i>and look at this...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<p>
"Secretariat

Under Investigation."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<p>
What am I supposed to do

with that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
Maybe it's

a different Secretariat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<p>
Ha ha ha ha. No,

but seriously, folks,

there is no truth

to these allegations.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
I have never bet on

horse racing,

and I certainly did not bet on

my own races.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<p>
Although I did bet the network's

gonna give your show

back to Joey Bishop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
O-- ho ho-- kay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
We get letters here on the show,

and one particular letter,

for you, actually, struck

a chord with our producers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<p>
This is from BoJack H.

BoJack is nine years old.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
BoJack writes,

"Dear Secretariat,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
I am a horse just like you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<p>
I like to watch racing,

and you are my favorite racer."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
Smart kid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
"When I grow up,

I want to be just like you,

and I think

I'm on the right track.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<p>
Get it? Track,

because horses run on tracks,

and you are a horse,

and I am a horse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<p>
Do you get it? Do you

get my joke about the track?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<p>
Okay, there's

a whole page of this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<p>
Should I write him back

and tell him I get it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
He goes on,

"My question for you is,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<p>
I am a good kid,

and I like to play,

and I like to go to school,

but sometimes I get sad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<p>
What do you do

when you get sad?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
How do you not be sad?

Sincerely, BoJack."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
That's a great letter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<p>
BoJack, when I was your age,

I got sad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<p>
A lot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<p>
I didn't come from

such a great home,

but one day, I started running,

and that seemed to make sense,

so then I just kept running.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<p>
BoJack, when you get sad,

you run straight ahead

and you keep running forward,

no matter what.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<p>
There are people in your life

who are gonna try to

hold you back, slow you down,

but you don't let them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:47" />

<p>
Don't you stop running and

don't you ever look behind you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

<p>
There's nothing for you

behind you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:51" />

<p>
All that exists is what's ahead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<p>
[woman] This is a first win

for BoJack Horseman

and his first appearance

at the Globe ceremony

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<p>
{\an8}since his forced removal

in 1992

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
{\an8}after he exchanged blows

with Sir Paul McCartney.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<p>
{\an8}Wow, what an honor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
I have to thank

the Hollywoo Foreign Press.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<p>
{\an8}I feel like I should mention

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
{\an8}that my book

was not a comedy or a musical.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<p>
{\an8}Do you guys actually watch

the movies you give awards to?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
'Cause I kind of

get the sense that--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
Also, my book was not a movie.

You do know that, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
We're friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
{\an8}Anyway, the response to this

book has been incredible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<p>
{\an8}These last three months

have been really amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
{\an8}You know, a lot of people

said to me,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
"You sure you want to

publish this book?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<p>
It's pretty personal."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
{\an8}And I said, "If I can make

just one person out there

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
{\an8}feel a little less alone,

then it's all worth it."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<p>
{\an8}And they said,

"That's really brave."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
{\an8}And I said, "Well, I'm not one

to call myself brave,

but since you said it,

yeah, I am."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
- After-party at my restaurant!

- [cheering, applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
Why did I say after-party

at my restaurant?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<p>
I do not want to throw a party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<p>
{\an8}It did seem unlike you. I'm

gonna go get some cotton candy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
{\an8}- You want some?

- No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<p>
{\an8}- Yes.

- There he is, man of the hour.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<p>
{\an8}- Hello, other grown up.

- Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<p>
Oh, cheer up, dummy.

Your book is a huge success.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
Everybody loves you.

You just won a Golden Globe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<p>
If you can't be happy tonight,

maybe you'll

never be happy again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<p>
I'm sorry, is that

supposed to be encouraging?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<p>
- Because it's super-bleak.

- Vincent Adultman...

how are things

at the old nine to five?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<p>
Good. I went to

the stock market today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<p>
I did a business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
I keep telling him

he works too hard.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<p>
Come on, Vincent, let's get away

from the rat race.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<p>
Take a cruise someplace

wet and Latin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<p>
I mean, can you imagine

this body in a swimsuit?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<p>
- I literally cannot.

- Vincent, let's do a lap.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
Have you met Brendan Fraser?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
I feel like you two

would love each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<p>
Whoa. Easy, easy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
I got to hand it to Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<p>
This book has been everything

she said it would be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
Yeah, she knows

what she's doing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<p>
How is Diane? I haven't

seen her since...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
Well, I haven't seen her

in a while.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
Oh, well, the book's

been huge for her, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<p>
She's practically as famous

as I am now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<p>
- We're like the Brangelinas.

- Well, I'm happy she's happy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
- And how are you?

- Well, it's been really hard--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<p>
Erica, is that you? Who

let you out of the burn ward?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<p>
- Get over here, you.

- Uhh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
Excuse me. I just have to tell

you how much I love your book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<p>
It's so naked and honest

and revealing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<p>
It is? Uh-oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<p>
I love the part about

how you became famous

so you could be constantly

surrounded by distraction

and wouldn't have to be

alone with yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<p>
I thought that was

a really profound observation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
Oh, yeah, definitely.

So profound.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<p>
- Do you want to get out of here?

- What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
Come back to my place,

maybe get a little more naked,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
- honest and revealing?

- Oh, no. No, thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
- What about you?

- Yeah, okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<p>
- Oh-- Whoa.

- [screams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<p>
Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
- Hey, Diane.

- You still friends with BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<p>
Heard you two

were on the outs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
You gonna write another book

about it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
Oh, you looking at

some oranges?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
You gonna write a book

about those oranges, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<p>
[cell phone vibrates]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
- Hello.

<i>- Diane.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
Sebastian St. Claire here,

famed billionaire

philanthropist/adventurer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
Please, hold your applause.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<p>
- Okay.

- You can applaud a little.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
I got your number

from Pinky Penguin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
I'm looking for a journalist

to follow me around

for a few months

and document my daring exploits

aiding ravaged communities

and displaced people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<p>
- Ssss.

- Wow, that sounds amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
But that's not usually

the kind of thing I write about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
Diane, if you can make people

care about BoJack Horseman,

surely you can make them

care about emaciated orphans

with missing limbs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<p>
We need to wake people up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
Well, I am a morning person.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<p>
I hope you mean mourning

with a "u,"

because, Diane,

this is deadly serious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
Oh, yes, of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<p>
You want to spend

three months in Sudan?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
Not just there. We're also

going to Haiti and Thailand

and Uganda and Chechnya.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<p>
Can't you do all that in L.A.?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<p>
I want to do something

important.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<p>
I want to help people

and do good work

and sleep on the ground

and poop in a bucket.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<p>
Honey, nobody wants to

poop in a bucket.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<p>
Maybe I do. Maybe

I want to poop in a bucket.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<p>
If you want to poop in a

bucket, we can get you a bucket.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
You don't have to go all the way

the Chechnylavakia.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
Am I saying that right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
It's not just

the pooping in a bucket.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
I think it might be good for me

to get out of L.A.

for a little bit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<p>
Sweetie, you know I support

you, whatever you want to do,

but you're not gonna find

what you're looking for

in these awful made-up places.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
The universe

is a cruel, uncaring void.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<p>
The key to being happy

isn't a search for meaning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<p>
It's to just keep yourself busy

with unimportant nonsense,

and eventually, you'll be dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
Well, I guess

I can keep my options open.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
Great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<p>
[whistles gleefully]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<p>
Hey, can I ask you something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
Did Vincent seem extra weird

to you last night?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<p>
Well, he's still three kids

in a trench coat, so, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<p>
We're going through a rough

patch. It's hard, you know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
He's works a full time job

at the business factory,

so when he gets home,

he just wants to unwind

by watching R-rated movies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
Ahh, I thought I was ready

for a real adult relationship,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
- but--

- [snores]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
Enough about me.

BoJack, you are on fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
Oh, are we talking

about me again?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
We have an offer on the table

for you to play the bad guy

in the new James Bond.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<p>
- Ehh.

- I agree. Total garbage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
But this, it's a new drama

from the Coen Brothers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<p>
A western about a one-horse town

and you're the horse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<p>
Hello, Oscar. What do you think?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<p>
I think now's the time

to finally make "Secretariat."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
Really? Now? Aren't you

a little, um, very too old?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<p>
You asked me what I wanted

to do. That's what I want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
That's all I've ever wanted,

and if I can't get it now,

then all of this

has been for nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<p>
Oh, fish. Of course!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
Why would you ever

make things easy for me

when instead you could make

things incredibly difficult?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
Laura, clear out

the rest of my day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<p>
I have to push a boulder

up a hill,

and then have it roll over me

time and time again

with no regard

for my well-being.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
Attagirl.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
All right, Todd. PB Livin'

needs a new project.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snacks

has been an enormous success,

but I got into this game

to make movies,

so let's make a movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
Well, I got a stack

of great scripts here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
Any one of them

would make a wonderful movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
Fantastic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<p>
But I also have this other

non-movie-related idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
Ooh, let's hear

the other idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<p>
Okay. I was

heading down Wilshire,

and I saw this empty

store front, and I thought,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<p>
"You know what

this world needs?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<p>
Edge of my seat over here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
A store where people can buy

Halloween stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<p>
Halloween store.

Feel like that's been done.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<p>
Yeah, in October,

but how come your never see

a Halloween store in January?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
- It's an untapped market.

- Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
A Halloween store

that's open year-round.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
- No, no. Just January.

- Brilliant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
That's the kind of idea

that wins Golden Globes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
I actually think the time

is right for "Secretariat,"

so what do you want to play,

like, Secretariat's dad

or his grandfather, maybe like

an elderly witch doctor

who puts a curse on him

or something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
Lenny, look, I know

I'm a little long in the tooth,

but I think that you

more than anyone

would know

not to count out an old pro.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
Don't play the ageism card

with me, kid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
I've laid farts that lasted

longer than your entire career.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
But Secretariat was dead at 27,

so who we kidding here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<p>
Just set the project up

and give me an audition.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
- That's all I ask.

- All right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
You got yourself

a "go" picture, kid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
And by you, I mean me.

And by "go" picture,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<p>
I mean I'll make some phone

calls, we'll see what I can do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<p>
And by kid,

I mean middle-aged adult.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<p>
[whispers] Shh. No, no, no.

Put it here. Put it here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<p>
- [whispers] Okay, I'll do it.

- Ahem.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
- Has this ever happened to you?

- Has what ever happened to me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<p>
- Todd?

- Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
What's going on?

Why are you talking like that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<p>
Todd, I just got

a phenomenal idea

for a Halloween costume.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<p>
Why don't you and I dash over

to the store right quick

and spend some hard-earned

American money?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<p>
Oh, but, Mr. Peanutbutter,

didn't you hear?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<p>
It's January, and

the Halloween store won't open

for another nine months.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
But I want satisfaction now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<p>
Has this ever happened to you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
Not to anyone ever

at any time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<p>
Ahem. We give you

Halloween in January,

a truly immersive

Halloween experience

for the rest of us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<p>
Halloween in January?

Please elaborate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
Okay, but before I do,

tell the audience.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
- Have we ever met before?

- Never.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
Well, according to facts,

there's more suicides in January

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
- than any other month.

- I'm getting pretty close over here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<p>
Also, there's less

Halloween stores. Coincidence?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
Wow, I'm convinced.

This store could save lives.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<p>
Unbelievable.

When your powers combine...

you are somehow even more stupid

than the sum of your stupids.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<p>
- Thank you.

- Go on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
You stop encouraging him

and you stop encouraging him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<p>
The two of you

are playing with fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
A fire called

Having a Good Idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
Or maybe

a fire called Friendship.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<p>
- Fires aren't called things.

- What about the Chicago fire?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<p>
Or Fire Island.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<p>
- Or Gabe.

- Who's Gabe?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
Just a fire I met once.

Named him Gabe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
- He sounds delightful.

- He was. Good guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
Business, business, business.

Is that all you ever think about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<p>
I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<p>
What's under that coat,

Vincent?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
- You need to let me in.

- Not right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<p>
I have to call

the guy at the office

and take the car to the place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<p>
It's always guys in places

with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<p>
You know, I thought

I wanted to date a real adult,

but I'm actually

young at heart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
I need to feel the grass

between my toes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
I want to wear jeans.

I want to dance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
- That's baby stuff.

- No, Vincent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
There's more to being an adult

than just work and business

and the tall-person rides at

Disneyland. I want to have fun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<p>
There has to be a difference

between monogamy and monotony.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<p>
What's mahumanunny?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<p>
Well, clearly we had

a different understanding

of what this was.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<p>
I'd like to be an adult about

this, but frankly, I'm hurt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<p>
I think you should just go,

just git. Get out of my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
Could I have another soda?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
BoJack, you know

Kelsey Jannings, our director.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
I really appreciate you

giving me this opportunity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
Secretariat

was kind of my hero as a kid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
Yeah, he was

a lot of people's hero.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<p>
Well, you know, here was a guy

who had everything--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<p>
Yeah, I know the story.

I'm the director.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<p>
Kelsey, be nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
She's just cranky because

she's already seen 30 people

read for this today,

and we are all so goddamn sick

of seeing auditions,

so whenever you're ready.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
Just jump right in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<p>
Great. Let's get to it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
[stilted] Hey,

ain't you that horse

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<p>
- that won all them races?

- Not today, ma'am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
Today I'm just a customer

who wants a warm slice of pie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<p>
Can I ask you a question?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
When you're out there

on that there racetrack,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<p>
- what are you running from?

- You want to know the truth?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
Nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<p>
Everyone's running

from something, sugar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>
No, I'm running from nothing.

I'm terrified of nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<p>
People come up to me,

they want my autograph,

they want my picture.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<p>
They think they recognize

something in me,

and I want to be that person

they think I am, but I'm not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<p>
They see a greatness in me, and

they mistake it for goodness,

but I... I know

there's nothing there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
As fast as I run,

I can't get way from that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
- Oh.

- Wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<p>
BoJack, I think I speak

for everyone when I say--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<p>
Oh, my God,

Andrew Garfield said yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<p>
- We have our Secretariat.

- We got Andrew Garfield?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<p>
Oh, my God,

it's the best day of my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<p>
[Lenny] You don't say no

to Spider-Man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<p>
[Kelsey] This movie

is gonna be amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<p>
Andrew...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<p>
Garfield!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<p>
Now, the pills

will give you nightmares--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<p>
I mean, just horrifying--

but the malaria

will give you death,

so you're going to want to

take the pills, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<p>
- Uh-huh.

- Hold on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<p>
A mosquito got into my tent.

What do you want?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<p>
- [cell phone vibrates]

- Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<p>
Diane, it's Princess Carolyn,

BoJack's agent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<p>
Yeah, I know who you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<p>
I'm the pink cat, the one

who used to date BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
We've met a lot of times.

You came to my wedding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<p>
<i>Listen,</i>

<i>the Turteltaub Company</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
<i>is making a movie</i>

<i>about Secretariat.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
And since you're such an expert,

they want to bring you on board

as a character consultant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<p>
What does that mean?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<p>
Oh, it's the cushiest job

in the world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<p>
You sit in a fancy chair

and eat pastries all day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<p>
And then once a week, you say,

"Secretariat wouldn't do that."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<p>
I don't know. I've already

been offered this other thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<p>
And did you know

there are orphans in Sudan--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
You take this job, you can buy

all the orphans you want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<p>
No, I don't want to buy them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<p>
Look, if you really

want to help people,

it doesn't hurt to have

a little money in your pocket.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<p>
Take the job now,

help the orphans later.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
- There's always later.

- Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<p>
Okay, talk it over

with your husband.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
I got to go

get my whiskers trimmed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
I run into walls for days,

but I look hot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<p>
- How's the pie here?

- Not good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
Well, I'll take all you got.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
Screw it. Throw it in a bowl

with some bourbon

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<p>
- and bring me a ladle.

- Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
BoJack, we notice you've been

pretty down in the dumps lately,

but we have something that we

think is going to cheer you up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:29" />

<p>
It's an exciting

new business venture

that's equal parts

new and exciting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<p>
Another one? What happened

to your Halloween store?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<p>
- What now?

- Oh, right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
The Halloween store.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<p>
We took the floor out

because Mr. Peanutbutter

kept scratching up the hardwood,

and then-- Did we ever get

the new floor installed?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<p>
Halloween? In January?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<p>
What a great ide-- Aah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<p>
[thud]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
Anyway, now we're

all about smoodies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<p>
- What?

- Smoodies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<p>
You're saying smoothies,

right? Smoothies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<p>
No. Smoodies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />

<p>
It's a mood that you drink

like a smoothie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<p>
I don't understand it.

How do you drink a mood?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<p>
- Like a smoothie.

- So it is a smoothie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:11" />

<p>
No, it's a smoodie--

A mood that you drink.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<p>
- How do you drink a mood?

- Like a smoothie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<p>
But do you buy it in a store?

What're the physical attributes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
We haven't worked out

all the kinks yet,

but the important thing is

we've gone public,

and we want you to get in on

the ground floor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
See, that's the problem

with all your ideas--

they don't have ground floors.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:32" />

<p>
Finally, a Halloween store

for the rest of-- Aah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<p>
[thud]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<p>
[man] Hello.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<p>
Anyway,

our launch party's tonight,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
- and we'd love it if you came.

- We spared no expense...

that's how confident we are

in our product.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<p>
- Your product-- Smoodies.

- Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<p>
Wait, did you say smoodies

or smoothies?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
Because we only make--

Which one do we make?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
I'd like to think

the smoodies make us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
Ahh, I can tell by your tone

that that was something smart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<p>
[hip-hop music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<p>
- Smoodie keychain?

- Smoodie cozy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<p>
-Smoodie bottle opener?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:07" />

<p>
It's a mood that you drink

like a smoothie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<p>
Todd, it is all happening.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<p>
Hooray. And you know I don't

throw that word around lightly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
All right. Now we just got to

make sure we focus

and actually follow through

on this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
I'd feel awful

if this great idea fell apart

because we got distracted

by something else,

as we are often wont to do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<p>
Wait, did you say

you feel awful or falafel?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<p>
I said, "Feel awful,"

but tell me more

about this falafel idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<p>
Falafel or fawaffle?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<p>
[dance music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<p>
BoJack, isn't this exciting?

Smoodies, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<p>
Do you even know

what a smoodie is?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<p>
I think it's some kind of

an adult onesie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
Whatever it is,

I'm trying new things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<p>
I'm single again,

and I'm loving it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<p>
- Let me repeat--

- Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
Vincent. Well, you've got

some nerve showing your face.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<p>
- I've got half a mind to--

- No, let me talk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<p>
I had a attitude problem,

but then I took a timeout,

and I thought about what I did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<p>
I wanted to be a big man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
But sometimes the biggest thing

a man can do is tell the truth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
And the truth about me is,

I... I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
- Okay, here we go.

- I love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<p>
- What?

- Oh, Vincent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
Let's go feel grass

between our toes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
- What?

- All right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
You're a better man

than I could ever be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
I wish my boyfriend

was that mature.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
- [groans]

- [cell phone vibrates]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<p>
- Hello?

- BoJack, it's Kelsey Jannings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
I got some news

about "Secretariat."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
- What's up?

<i>- Garfield's out.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
He got into

some sort of accident.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<p>
An All Hallows' Eve store

in January?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
How fiendishly droll.

Aah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<p>
[thud]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<p>
Oh, bother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
The clumsy bastard

broke every bone in his body,

and now we got to find

a new lead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<p>
Studio wants to go young,

but I was thinking we'd get

someone a little more

BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<p>
What? Are you serious?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<p>
You're the only one with

enough grit to play the part,

and we can age you down in post,

but I'm gonna tell you now,

not gonna put up with

any woe-is-me bullshit

or diva histrionics.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
I get enough of that

from my ex-wife

along with newspaper clippings

about gluten.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
God, we get it, Marla.

Gluten.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<p>
But if you want to make a movie,

and you're ready to work...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<p>
I am. I will.

I can. I do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<p>
Great. You got one month

to get in shape.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
You need to lose 50 pounds

and then gain back 20.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
- And, BoJack...

- Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
Don't ever call this number.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
If I want to talk,

I'll call you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<p>
[cell phone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
- Hey.

- Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
Not big on parties, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
Nah. I never know what to do

with my hands.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<p>
I think I just got cast

in <i>Secretariat.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
- That's amazing.

- It's everything I ever wanted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
- Yeah, you seem super-jazzed.

- What do I do now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
Well, that's the problem

with life, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<p>
Either you know what you want,

and you don't get what you want,

or get what you want, and then

you don't know what you want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
- Well, that's stupid.

- Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
I don't know if this makes you

more or less excited,

but I actually decided to take

a job on the <i>Secretariat</i> movie

as a character consultant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
Wow, so we're gonna be

working together again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
Yeah. I hope

you don't get sick of me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<p>
I don't think

that's gonna happen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
- Is it weird I took this job?

- Why would it be weird?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<p>
You literally wrote the book

on Secretariat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
Yeah, I know. I just--

When I first moved to L.A...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<p>
I thought I was gonna be doing

really important work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<p>
You know, writing stuff

that makes a difference.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
But then you kind of fall into

one thing and then another...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<p>
Well, you've got time.

There's always later, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
Yeah, I guess

there's always later.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
Do you remember

the last time I saw you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<p>
You asked me if I thought you

were a good person deep down?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
Do I remember that?

Yeah, vaguely.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
You caught me off guard.

I didn't know what to say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<p>
Well, do you think

I'm a good person... deep down?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
That's the thing. I don't

think I believe in deep down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
I kind of think all you are

is just the things that you do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
- Well, that's depressing.

- [laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
For what it's worth,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
I think your writing

does make a difference.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<p>
Thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<p>
I really wanted you

to like me, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />
