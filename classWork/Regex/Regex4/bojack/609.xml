<p>
Acting is about leaving everything behind,

and... [clicks tongue, sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
And becoming something completely new.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
What is acting? Anyone?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
Acting is about

leaving everything behind, and...

becoming something completely new.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
Becoming something completely new. [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
[both] Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<p>
[exhales] Hey-o!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<p>
[chuckles nervously] Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
What is acting?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
Anyone?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<p>
Anyone?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<p>
Acting is about leaving everything behind

and becoming something completely new.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<p>
Nailed it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<p>
And that's a Sharpie.

[clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:30" />

<p>
{\an8}Good morning,

my name is Professor Horseman,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:32" />

<p>
{\an8}which will remain

on that whiteboard forever,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:34" />

<p>
{\an8}and this is Intermediate Scene Study.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:36" />

<p>
{\an8}What is acting? Anyone?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<p>
-[all] Ooh!

-Oh! Okay. You.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<p>
{\an8}According to Stanislothski,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:42" />

<p>
{\an8}acting is the desire

to create inside of oneself

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<p>
{\an8}another, deeper, more interesting life

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:47" />

<p>
{\an8}than the one

that actually surrounds him...

or her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<p>
-Oh, okay, yes, but also... Yes?

-[girl] Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:53" />

<p>
{\an8}Meisner would say, "Acting is behaving

truthfully under imaginary circumstances."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<p>
Acting is behaving truthfully

under imaginary circumstances.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<p>
Uh, okay, wow. So, that's acting.

But what is--?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:03" />

<p>
{\an8}Guys, I'm concerned this class

is getting very theory-qua-theory...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<p>
 I was about to say that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:08" />

<p>
{\an8}...when technique should be a means

toward a more engaging art.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<p>
-Well, quite astute.

-Sorry, horse professor. What's acting?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:14" />

<p>
{\an8}Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
{\an8}Acting is the, um... [grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<p>
Acting is...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
{\an8}I don't know what acting is.

I don't know what I'm doing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<p>
I shouldn't be here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<p>
-[boy] Wow.

-[girl] Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
{\an8}No, I don't want to quit.

I'm acting! That's acting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<p>
Class dismissed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
But we still have

an hour and 20 minutes left.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<p>
Yes. Again, I was acting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<p>
You sounded serious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
Instead of judging my acting,

how about you act and I judge you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
{\an8}-For real?

-Yeah. Good point.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
{\an8}We could show you the scenes

we were working on last semester.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<p>
Uh, sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
{\an8}-This is from "Kablammo, Mother."

-Whenever you're ready.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
{\an8}Mama, where's Daddy's old World War II

grenade with the pin still in it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
[in British accent] Why would you want

an old thing like that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
Tonight, I intend to explode myself.

Where are the extra towels?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
-Okay, okay. Stop, stop.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
{\an8}-Does this play take place in England?

-[normal voice] No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
{\an8}So why are you talking

with an English accent?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<p>
I'm acting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
Just as an exercise,

maybe use your normal voice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<p>
{\an8}And Tawnie, when you're telling

your mother you're gonna kill yourself,

the next line is,

"Where are the extra towels," right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<p>
And the character's being very casual,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
{\an8}so maybe she should also be casual

when she says she's gonna kill herself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
{\an8}Like it's a big deal,

but it's not a big deal for her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
-Like that's the irony of the scene.

-Whoa! That's really smart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<p>
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
Okay, let's see it again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<p>
So, darling, what fun and games

shall we play?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<p>
Shall we play Scattergories?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
[raspy voice] I detest Scattergories!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<p>
Whatever the prompt,

you always answer in vague allusions

to the baby we never had!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<p>
Stop. You're both talking to the audience.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<p>
I want you to talk to each other,

you're having a conversation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
-Hey! Who's you?

-Who's me? Screw you is who's me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
I got the leads.

The Gooba Gooberry Falls leads.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
Mm! Them's them good leads.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<p>
-Hubba hubba, I'm horny for leads!

-Okay, here's my question for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<p>
Does your character

know he's horny for leads,

or is he discovering it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<p>
Who's next? Great. What's the scene?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
The scene is I'm late for my next class.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
We were supposed to get out

20 minutes ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<p>
Oh, shit. Sorry. See you Wednesday.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<p>
Great work today. Way to go, team.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<p>
We did it. That was great, huh?

How good was I?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
-[sighs]

-[door closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
Whitfield, we've been here six weeks.

How do you think this is going?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<p>
-I think I'm crushing it.

-Wow, okay. Well, I admire the confidence.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
I know you're an acting major.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<p>
And I guess I just-- I wanted to make sure

that you're taking other classes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
Like, Economics,

or maybe a plumbing course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<p>
Or rental car cashier class? I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
What would you want to do

if the acting thing doesn't work out?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
Hold up, do you think

I'm not a good actor?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<p>
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
You said "Not a good actor."

But now that you've said it...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<p>
Some would say there are no bad actors,

only bad teachers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
What about Jason Segel?

He was a bad actor in <i>Bad Teacher.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
I am a wonderful actor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
You'll see.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<p>
-[door closes]

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<p>
She knew I was drunk,

but she still let me drive off

with Jonathan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
Whoa, oh! I'm a drunk!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<p>
Jesus, I had no idea, I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
Booze has taken everything from me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
-My job as an airline pilot, my wife.

-Huh? What the--?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<p>
Those two things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
[sighs] Okay. I see what's happening.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
Sorry, everybody.

This is one of my acting students.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
-He's trying to, um--

-Who's Whitfield?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<p>
-Nobody said "Whitfield."

-My name is Whip Whitaker.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<p>
-Did you follow me here?

-I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<p>
Drove the plane upside-downsy.

Yeah, I'm drunk now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<p>
-Wow.

-No, don't--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
We've all been there, man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
He hasn't been there.

That's the plot of the movie <i>Flight.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
Glug, glug, glug.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<p>
-That wet the ol' whistle.

-So sorry, everyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<p>
Now I'm completely over the 0.8 percent

blood alcohol level.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
-I'm in trouble. I am wasted.

-This is very disrespectful.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
-Hammered...

-We work hard to create a safe space here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<p>
-...tanked, blitzed...

-So sorry about that. I recognize that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
-...Irish, canned, smashed...

-I value this room, just know that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<p>
-...annihilated, laced, faded.

-Really sorry about all of this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
-So sorry.

-In conclusion, I am a drunk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<p>
The big D.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
-Fine. Shut up. You're a drunk.

-Aha! Wrong, I was acting!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
It appears the student

has become the student-er.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<p>
[sighing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<p>
Wow, an actor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<p>
-Uh... [grunts]

-[crowd cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
[both grunt]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<p>
Foul! That fowl fouled, ref!

Where's the whistle?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<p>
-Ugh!

-There are women tossing women everywhere!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
What is this, the Running of the Brides

at Filene's Basement?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<p>
Who's with me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<p>
[slurps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<p>
-Um, they're allowed to do that in rugby.

-What? Really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
Also, nobody knows

what Filene's Basement is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<p>
That's a shame. You definitely paid

too much for that coat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<p>
-[whistle trills]

-Oh, is it over? Did we win?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
[exhales] Hey, you're really good.

I think.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<p>
Don't feel like you have to come

to these things if it's not your thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<p>
No, I liked it. Look at us. Doing college.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
I'm just saying you have your things

and I have my things. It's okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
-You wanna get something to eat?

-I-I can't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<p>
When we win,

we all go to Conspiracy to celebrate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
-Sounds fun. Can I join you?

-I don't think you should.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<p>
It's a bar,

and there will be alcohol there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
-That's okay.

-And young girls.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<p>
-What's that have to do with anything?

-Nothing. Just stating a fact.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<p>
-Okay. Well, then, I guess I'll see you.

-Wouldn't wanna be you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
But I would. You're cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<p>
Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<p>
Yes, good. Keep doing what they're doing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
[sighs] Tawnie,

you're Hollyhock's best friend...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<p>
-We're actually in a fight right now.

-Again?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
Our fights are like Adele songs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
All kind of the same one,

but with different specifics.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
-Well, do you understand this rugby thing?

-Uh, honestly? No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<p>
She came back from winter break

super aggro, but that's Hollyhock, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<p>
Suddenly, she decides,

"This is what I'm all about now,

and everyone else

just has to get on board."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
What are we supposed to do with that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
-Whoa!

-I guess... get on board.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<p>
[whistle trills]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
Get it out, get it-- Yes, nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
Nice run! Very nice!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
Touchdown! That's my sister!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
Good try!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<p>
Try? She did it. She scored.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<p>
It's called a try.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
Try to keep up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
-Hey! Hey!

-[sighing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<p>
-Yeah!

-Yes, Cardinals!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<p>
-All right!

-All right!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<p>
[both grunt]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<p>
The two teams applaud each other,

and then the referees.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
As is customary. See footnote.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
We know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<p>
What's up, rugger?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
Two tries, two conversions,

and a drop goal?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
Jonah Lomu over here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
-Great game, Hock.

-Oh, Hock.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
I like it.

Can I get a nickname too, Regina?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
How about, "Professor Horseman,

adult faculty member"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:16" />

<p>
-We have to go.

-Yeah, go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
Go. See you.

See you on the scrumming pitch.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
[whistle trills]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<p>
W-E-S-leyan!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<p>
We will rock and maul and win!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
Wait. Where's Hollyhock?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
You mean Hollyhock

Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
Hey. What the hell? You quit rugby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
God. You sound like three of my dads.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
-The other five were relieved.

-You were good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
I need to focus on my studies.

I'm not just here to get my ya-yas out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
Yeah, but rugby's our thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:48" />

<p>
Okay, then I guess we'll just--

We'll find a new thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
How about my thing is reading

<i>Gender Trouble </i>by Judith Butler,

and your thing is being a teacher?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
Are you okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<p>
[sighs] I'm just busy with school stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
You got your showcase in a couple weeks?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
"An Evening of Modern American Scenes"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<p>
Yeah. I'll-- I'll go to that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
-Great. I'll see you then.

-Yeah, see you then.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<p>
Not if I see you first--!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
[phone ringing, beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
-Hello?

-Hey, listen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<p>
-It's your very good accountant, Gaz.

-Hey, Gaz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<p>
I just noticed you spent

a lot of money last year.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<p>
-Did you go to rehab? Like, a lot?

-You just noticed that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<p>
I've got a ton of clients, okay?

And this was a big cocaine year for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<p>
But we're fine. Just make another movie,

and you'll be fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<p>
-You're working on a movie?

<i>-No.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
Actually, I'm a college professor now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
[sputters] What, do you hate money?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<p>
-<i>Gaz...</i>

-Ah, no, no, no, it's fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
Basically, we're fine.

As I told my wife before she left me,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<p>
I'm not worried,

and you shouldn't be either.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
We may need to unload some assets, though.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<p>
-You still own that restaurant?

-Elefante?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
I'd love to dump that money pit,

but what idiot would buy it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<p>
-Sold! On this arrangement.

-Of course you're sold. It was your idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
Explain it to me one more time?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<p>
Okay. You'll spend a lot of time

with international superstar

sex symbol, Joey Pogo,

building a close emotional bond.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<p>
After you've established that connection,

you'll share one magical evening

of intimate sexual congress,

after which, we'll finally be even.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
You'll marry me, and the two of you

will never see each other again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
-Well, I guess it's worth a try.

-♪ <i>Who's that dog? ♪</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
<i>-♪ Mr. Peanutbutter ♪</i>

-Excuse me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<p>
-[phone beeps]

-Hello? No?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<p>
Really? Wow, hold on a sec.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
Pickles, should I buy Elefante?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<p>
Ooh! Then you'd be my husband and my boss.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<p>
Like Ike and Tina Turn-- No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<p>
-Well, I'm sure there are good examples.

-There must be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<p>
But buying a restaurant's

a big commitment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
What if I went in on it with you?

I like food.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
Great idea, Joey Pogo. I'm in!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
On you being in. On it. With me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
I've got big ideas for this place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<p>
One word-- lazy Susans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<p>
Hold on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<p>
Before we make any rash decisions,

should we maybe consider the long-term...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
[stammers] Pickles, this guy on the phone

is waiting, and I don't want to be rude.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
Sorry. Of course.

Finish your conversation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
-Sold!

-[phone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<p>
-Now, you were saying?

-...ramifications.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<p>
Lazy Susans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
[raspy voice] Oh, Heidi,

you'll never bag a man

with all your talk of feminism,

and your grandfather in Switzerland,

and all your little goat friends--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>
Stop. Terry, this character is 28.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<p>
Is that what you think

a 28-year-old sounds like?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<p>
[normal voice] I mean, yes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<p>
You do the same old-man voice

for every character.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
Gotta have a gimmick if I'm gonna make it

in the show business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
In "the show business,"

when they have old man characters,

they cast real old men.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<p>
-I'll show you.

-Please don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<p>
You'll see.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
We still have 20 minutes of class left.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<p>
I'd driven across that bridge drunk

hundreds of times, but never on black ice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
-[door opens]

-[Terry in raspy voice] Back in my day,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
-we called that "the hidden slipperies."

-Oh, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<p>
But we didn't go to meetings

and talk about our problems.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<p>
-No, we made moonshine in bathtubs.

-Please leave. Now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<p>
-Who's Terry?

-Nobody said Terry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
Mind if I sit a spell?

These old bones need a rest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<p>
Sure, take it easy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<p>
Everyone, this is another one

of my students.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<p>
I'm very sorry, I have no idea

why they think this is gonna impress me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
I just relieved myself in my adult diaper.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<p>
Terry...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
Here I am, in the twilight of my years,

having drunk it all away.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<p>
-My job as an airline pilot...

-Wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<p>
-My son...

-You don't have a son.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<p>
Not anymore I don't,

because I abandoned him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<p>
I abandoned my boy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>
-[Whitfield] Papa?

-My boy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<p>
-Oh, my God.

-Papa? Is that you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<p>
I've gone blind, me has,

from working in the distillery!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
Oh, my sweet child!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<p>
Todd, why don't you and Ruthie

go for a stroll

while I talk to these acting students?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<p>
She's just a baby, and I don't want

to expose her to too much desperation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<p>
-You got it, boss.

-[Ruthie giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
Today, we have a very special guest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
This is my friend, Princess Carolyn,

who was nice enough to come here

to talk about the business of acting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<p>
So, please do not embarrass me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<p>
Oh, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<p>
How many months

until people get discovered, usually?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<p>
One? Two? [gasps] Three?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<p>
This is more of a comment than a question,

but I've seen every Robert Altman movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<p>
What's the best diner to be discovered in

drinking a milkshake?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<p>
What if I want to do nudity?

Do I still have to sign a waiver?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
Huh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
[yawns]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<p>
Whoo!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<p>
Hey, who's the kid

that didn't ask a question?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<p>
-The brooding kid in the back.

-Oh, that's Stan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<p>
That kid's got it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
The look, the sauce,

the power to make me feel

like a 13-year-old girl,

and to make a 13-year-old girl

feel like a woman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<p>
I wanna cast him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<p>
-You haven't even seen him act.

-Is he good?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<p>
[sighs] He's the best actor I got.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<p>
I had my doubts

when he did the scene from <i>Proof,</i>

but when he did the scene from <i>Doubt,</i>

I thought, "There's the proof."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<p>
-I have to sign him.

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<p>
Stan needs to finish school.

He's a sophomore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<p>
Great! A legal adult but he looks young.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
He can play all the roles that other

young, impressionable actors can't

because they keep ODing,

or going to prison, or going to rehab,

or killing themselves.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<p>
-No, he's not ready.

-Why don't we let Stan decide?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<p>
I want to be your manager.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
And I can get you Brooding Birthday Boy

on "Birthday Dad" right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<p>
Stan, LA's not going anywhere.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
But you need an education,

something to keep you grounded.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
Stan, look at me.

You have an opportunity now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<p>
What do you need, a piece of paper?

You're done with this place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
Stan? Stan. Stan, Stan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<p>
One day, you're gonna look back

and realize these days on campus,

they were the last days

you were truly free.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<p>
You want "free"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
Check out the Smirnoff Ice gifting suite

at the <i>Emmy Awards</i> after-party!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<p>
My whole career, all I wanted

was to get to a place like this,

and I didn't even know it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<p>
Out there, there's nothing to protect you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<p>
No, but there's a Patagonia jacket

that says "Birthday Dad" on it

that you get from being on "Birthday Dad."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<p>
We're safe here, Stan.

Please, don't make the mistake I did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
Come on, you'll get your own chair

with your name on it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
-[sighs] Damn it.

-Oh, good boy. Yes, he's a good boy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<p>
Okay, first thing,

we're gonna get these teeth fixed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<p>
[air horns blaring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<p>
[vocalizing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<p>
Marshmallow?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<p>
Thanks! [munching]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<p>
That was for the child.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
Oh, should've specified.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<p>
If she can abstain from eating

the marshmallow for 15 minutes,

she'll receive an even bigger reward.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
An even bigger reward than a marshmallow?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
Remember these times, Ruthie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
[phone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<p>
[phone buzzes, beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<p>
-Go Todd for Maude!

-You're sitting in front of a marshmallow,

and if you don't eat it,

you get a bigger reward in 15 minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
-What do you do?

-Don't be a sucker, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<p>
Eat the marshmallow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<p>
Who knows what the world's gonna be like

in 15 minutes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<p>
That's all I needed to hear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<p>
-Thanks, Maude.

-[phone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:52" />

<p>
[Ruthie giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<p>
Oh, no! What have I done?

We've got to find another marshmallow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<p>
-[phone buzzes, beeps]

-Hey, Todd. You've got the Maude Squad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<p>
Just kidding, it's just Maude.

I don't have a squad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<p>
Maude? I didn't go to college.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<p>
-Where can I get a marshmallow?

-The dining hall?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<p>
Dining hall?

This is Wesleyan, not Hogwarts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<p>
What's in a marshmallow anyway?

Maybe I can make one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<p>
I think they're mostly chemicals.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<p>
To the chemistry lab!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
-[grunts] You! Make me a marshmallow!

-[Ruthie giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>
I'm trying to cure brain cancer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<p>
That's not important right now!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<p>
If I don't get a new marshmallow,

some psychiatrist

is gonna get mad at this baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<p>
A psychiatrist?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<p>
I am so sick of the soft sciences

wagging the dog

in conversations

of behavioral development.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<p>
Let's teach them a lesson!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<p>
-I'm sorry, but the experiment's over.

-What? Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
Because you ate the marshmallow.

Good day, sir.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<p>
Doctor?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
You did it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<p>
Hello, my name is Willie Wesleyan,

and you've won the school, my boy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<p>
Wesleyan University is yours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<p>
What? Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<p>
Somebody needs to keep

that stuffy old board of trustees in check

once I've shed this mortal skin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<p>
-Oh...

-Sorry about that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
We're doing LSD research

in the room next door.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<p>
-Come on, Mr. Phillips. Time to go.

-[laughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<p>
The frozzleberries

taste like banozzleberries!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
Yes, Mr. Phillips,

everything tastes like something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
So this is college.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
[drum roll]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
[knocks on door]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
-You wanted to see me?

-Amy, yeah. Um, have a seat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
So we're nearing

the end of the semester here,

and I'm putting together the cast sheet

for the student showcase.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<p>
-Uh-huh.

-This showcase is a big deal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<p>
This might sound crazy coming from

famous television star, BoJack Horseman,

but in some ways,

this showcase means even more to me

than the very popular TV shows

that, again, I was the star of.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
-It means a lot to me, too.

-Does it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
'Cause you've been missing

a lot of classes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<p>
And forgetting your lines.

You seem tired all the time, and...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<p>
I can be better. I'll prove it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<p>
As the water rose, I remember

fumbling through the glove compartment,

just praying

that I could find a pin hammer

so I could shatter the window.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<p>
-Uh, excuse me, is this...

-No. Nope, no, no, no. Get out of here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<p>
-This has to stop.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
This is a place for people who are serious

about making a change,

not for desperate acting students

pretending to have problems, Amy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
I was just trying to get help!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
-Oof!

-[crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
Oh! Oops! That was...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
Oops.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<p>
-Hey, do you know what this show's about?

-I think it's about to start.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
So keep your rugby voice

on the field, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
It turns out my hypothesis was correct.

Kids love marshmallows.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<p>
You don't say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
You still working on that memoir?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
Well, funny story about that...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
Oh, I love when stories start like that!

Ooh! You should put this one in your book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
Where the hell is she?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<p>
Horse professor, we're ready when you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
Lights.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<p>
-[applause]

-Hello.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
Thank you. Oh, wow, thank you.

That's very nice, thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<p>
Welcome to

"An Evening of Modern American Scenes."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<p>
The students are very excited

to perform for you tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
They've come such a long way

over the course of the semester.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<p>
Like, a really-- a really long way.

They were very bad before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<p>
But now...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
Well, I mean,

you'll see for yourself, uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
But, um, I'm proud of them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
Anyway, first up is a scene

from Sam German-Shepherd's "Real America."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
[crowd whooping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
You think real America's

all about cowboys?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<p>
[line ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
Well, I say real America's about business!

And capitalism!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
-[voicemail] <i>Hey, it's Hollyhock.</i>

-Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<p>
<i>-Leave a message, if you're a hundred.</i>

-God damn it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<p>
I'm starting to think the real America

is me kicking your ass!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
[all gasp]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<p>
BoJack? Oh, shit, your showcase!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<p>
Tawnie's gonna be so pissed!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<p>
Forget Tawnie. I'm pissed!

And it's happening right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
I'm sorry. I forgot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
I know your students just have to do

a scene, but I have multiple final papers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<p>
If you're implying

acting is a bullshit major, you're right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<p>
But people came all the way

from California to see my showcase.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
From Chicago.

You can't even walk across campus?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<p>
Okay, let me put some pants on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
-You've been avoiding me all semester.

-I just have a lot going on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<p>
I go to school here.

I'm a college student.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
-I thought I'd see you more.

-This was mine before you got here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<p>
This was my life, my world,

and you just, like, live here now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<p>
And you could have asked me, by the way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
Okay, I'm sorry.

I guess I thought my sister...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
No, don't say that.

Like it means something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<p>
-It does mean something.

-We don't know each other, really.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<p>
-What?

-No, I'm just saying it's fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<p>
I had a life before I met you,

and you had a life before you met me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
I don't want that life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<p>
That life, that person?

That's not who I am, I...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<p>
I'm sorry I came here

without asking you first.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
That was selfish.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<p>
Okay. Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<p>
If this is too weird for you,

I don't have to come back next semester.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
I can get a job somewhere else.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<p>
Tawnie says you're a really good teacher.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
She did? Huh.

I thought you were in a fight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
Yeah, but I still love her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<p>
Are we in a fight?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<p>
Yeah, but... [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<p>
Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<p>
I should get back to the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<p>
If you want to come back in the fall,

that could be cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
-Yeah?

-Just...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<p>
We need to take things slow, you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
Yeah. I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<p>
Thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<p>
[Terry in raspy voice] <i>And in that moment,</i>

-[panting]

I'm just a 15-year-old boy

living in Brighton Beach.

<p>
-Come on. Get up here.

-No, no, no.

<p>
-Get up here.

-No, no, no. Come on.

</p>

<timestamp data-time="00:24:54" />

<p>
-You need to stop this.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:57" />

<p>
The reporters who keep trying

to get Penny to tell her story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:00" />

<p>
What-- What reporters?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:01" />

<p>
Whatever they're doing,

I don't want to be included, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:04" />

<p>
I don't want my daughter to be included.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:07" />

<p>
Charlotte, I swear, I don't know

what you're talking about.

</p>
