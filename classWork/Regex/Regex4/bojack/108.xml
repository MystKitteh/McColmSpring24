<p>
[BoJack] <i>Oh, right.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:06" />

<p>
<i>Well, just tell whoever,</i>

<i>then.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:08" />

<p>
- Haaah!

- [tires screech]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:09" />

<p>
Ooh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<p>
[honks horn]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<p>
- Asshole!

- [tires squeal]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<p>
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu

to see Herb Kazzaz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<p>
He has cancer, which,

as you know, is a whole thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
Plus, he hates me,

so I could really use

some good news

at the end of the day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
Oh, my God.

You're going to see Herb?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<p>
You must be really--

Nope.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<p>
- Don't care. Not interested.

- [phone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
Okay, Good talk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
- Ready for this?

- Listen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
I want to make sure

I don't spend

any time alone with Herb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
I'm bringing you

along as my buffer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<p>
And your memoirist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<p>
I should meet

your old best friend

before he dies of cancer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
Fine, I guess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
Just don't abandon me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<p>
No bathroom breaks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
And don't slip out

of the room

to text your fiancé

a bunch of winky smileys

with hearts next to them--

Gross.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
Congratulations on

the whole being engaged thing,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<p>
- by the way.

- Thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
It's just starting

to hit me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<p>
I'm getting married.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
Thank God I don't

have to die alone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
- No offense.

- None taken.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<p>
Till you said, "No offense."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<p>
So what's the deal with you

and this guy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
You never talk about him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<p>
Well, I kind of, maybe

stabbed him in the back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<p>
Yeah, it's a bit of a story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<p>
A story of power, betrayal,

and ambitious hairstyles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<p>
The year?

198--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<p>
- Movie's over.

- Watch the next one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<p>
Aw, I'm tired

of watching movies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<p>
- Do you want to play a game?

- Sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<p>
I spy with my little eye

someone who needs

to shut the hell up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<p>
- Is it me?

- It's always you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<p>
- Now, where was I?

- You were about to tell

a story about you being

a shitty friend,

but then, we got interrupted

by you yelling at Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<p>
Oh, yeah.

Shut up, Todd.

</p>

Why do we need

a kitchen and a bathroom?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<p>
Pipes are pipes, people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<p>
{\an8}Do we really need

a toilet and a sink

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<p>
{\an8}and a bathtub and--

Wait, hold on--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:03" />

<p>
{\an8}A whole 'nother room

with another sink?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<p>
{\an8}They're all just holes

to the ocean, lady.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<p>
{\an8}I mean, come on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:08" />

<p>
{\an8}[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<p>
{\an8}BoJack, you're late.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<p>
Here. I got you a beer.

It's on the house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<p>
Don't tell my boss.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
Thanks, Charlotte,

but one beer gets me tipsy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
I got to be clear-headed

for my set.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<p>
Looks like Herb's killing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<p>
Yeah, and the suits

from ABC are here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
[laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<p>
Look. They're nodding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<p>
That's the executive version

of laughing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<p>
Wow. They must be serious

about Herb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
That's Angela Diaz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<p>
She's the woman who made

pantsuits a thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
Oh, before I forget.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<p>
Herb and I are gonna see

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
<i>Back to the Future </i>again

this weekend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
- Want to come?

- I'm in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<p>
That movie was amazing,

except for all

the lame time period jokes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<p>
We get it.

The '50s were different.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
I'll have

a New Coke, please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
Listen, you guys don't need

to include me on your dates.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<p>
{\an8}Sometimes, it makes me feel

like a third wheel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
BoJack, stop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
Without the third wheel,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
{\an8}how would you ride

a tricycle?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<p>
{\an8}Wouldn't that make it

a bicycle?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
Herb Kazzaz,

ladies and gentlemen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<p>
[applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
- Hey-ooh!

- Great set, man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
It's like everything

you said was something

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
I've thought before but never

had the balls to say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<p>
Thanks, BJ.

I set 'em up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
Now, you knock 'em down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
{\an8}Let's give it up

for BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
{\an8}- [applause]

- Well, thank you, Bubbles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
{\an8}I love L.A.

Don't you guys?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<p>
The prettiest girls in

the world flock to this city,

and they end up

with total knobs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<p>
Take this couple,

for example.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
[laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<p>
Excuse me, miss.

Is that your date?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<p>
He's my husband.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<p>
That's your husband?

You can do better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
Give me a call

after the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<p>
{\an8}- [laughter]

- I'm just kidding around.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
[whispers]

I'm not kidding around.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
[laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
{\an8}Maker's Manhattan?

2:00 P.M.?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<p>
{\an8}Not judging.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<p>
{\an8}That guy tipped me a quarter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<p>
{\an8}That's barely enough money

to buy three gallons of gas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<p>
{\an8}- You want a slug?

- No, I got to stay sharp.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
{\an8}I got another audition

this afternoon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<p>
{\an8}God, I can't wait till

I'm finally up

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<p>
{\an8}for real jobs instead

of these dumb commercials.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<p>
{\an8}"Here's the thing about

most long-distance plans."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<p>
Ugh. I hate

when people say that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<p>
- "Here's the thing."

- It's so stupid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<p>
Just say the thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
You don't need to introduce

the concept

that there's going

to be a thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
I don't expect to

be offered <i>Secretariat</i>

right away,

but when am I gonna be up

for real roles?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
We'll get there, BJ.

We both will.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<p>
In fact, if I play

my cards right,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
I might get there real soon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
Wait.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<p>
- Did the guys from ABC call?

- Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
They invited me

to some hotshot event

at LACMA this weekend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<p>
I'm gonna pitch 'em a TV show

while they're drunk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
An off-the-clock,

non-work-related social event?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<p>
That's the perfect time

to pitch a TV show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
You're brilliant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<p>
These people are so fancy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<p>
Look, look, look.

Hey, hey, look.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<p>
That's Joyce DeWitt,

isn't it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
That's Joyce DeWitt.

And that's Angela Diaz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
And that's Ubu,

the guy who sits.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
- He<i> </i>is<i> </i>a good dog.

- [Ubu barks]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
Guys, don't take

your eyes off the prize.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<p>
We need to fill Charlotte's bag

with these mini quiches.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<p>
This is our breakfast

for June.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
- Herb Kazzaz.

- Shit, we're busted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<p>
- [plate shatters]

- Pretend you don't speak English.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
<i>Buongiorno. </i>Bon Jovi.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
Salutations.

Crap, that's English.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<p>
Hey, you mind if I steal

this superstar for a second?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
Okay, yeah.

I'll catch you two later.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
Stay out of trouble.

Oh, ho.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
Well, there he goes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<p>
Herb's about to hit

the big time,

and I'm just gonna be

a small-fry

doing tiny commercials

and eating mini quiches.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
You're dead wrong.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<p>
You're gonna be

a big success.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<p>
Herb says that to me

all the time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<p>
- He thinks the world of you.

- He does?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<p>
Yeah, I'm not worried about

if you'll become a star.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
I'm more worried about how

you'll change when it happens.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
Like, you think I'll get fat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<p>
No, that's not

what I'm talking about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<p>
So you're saying

I definitely

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
- won't get fat?

- No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<p>
Well, make up your mind,

lady.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
Look over there.

See those tar pits?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
Hollywood's a real pretty town

that's smack on top

of all that black tar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
By the time you realize

you're sinking,

it's too late.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
Wait, is this

a science lesson?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
No, BoJack,

it's a metaphor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<p>
- Ugh, that's worse.

- BoJack, I'm moving to Maine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<p>
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
- Does Herb know?

- Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
I don't think I'm the person

Herb's looking for.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
I'm going to miss you,

Charlotte.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
Hey, do you ever wonder

what would have happened

if you'd met me

before Herb did?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
Would you have made

a move on me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<p>
- Charlotte--

- I don't think you would have.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<p>
You know why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<p>
I think you're a coward.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
Now go stuff some prosciutto

in your pants

before that Webster kid

takes it all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
[upbeat music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
[Herb] I love this town.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
Why did you bring me

to Griffith Park?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<p>
Are we gonna get in

a knife fight

like in

<i>Rebel Without a Cause?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
- I hate that title.

- He had several causes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<p>
I wanted to give you this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<p>
Look out at that city.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<p>
What do you see?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<p>
Wow, I didn't realize

there were

so many day hookers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
I see a city

that you and I

will run someday,

and when we're both famous

and have everything

we've ever wanted,

we'll come back here together

and high five.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
I'm not fully on board

with this new high five thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<p>
What ever happened

to the low five?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
Give me some skin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
BJ, listen.

I got a call from ABC today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
They bought my TV pitch.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<p>
What?

That's amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
- What's the show?

- It's called <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
Well, good luck

on your rocket ship

to the top without me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<p>
No, BoJack,

the show's about a horse,

and I told those suits

if they want my show,

then that horse is gonna

be BJ Goddamn Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<p>
- Oh, my God.

- And they said, "No."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<p>
- Oh.

- And I said, "Please?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<p>
And they said, "Okay."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
So, what do you say?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
- Want to be my star?

- Seriously?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
Of course I do.

Of course, Herb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
Jesus Christ, thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<p>
Mm-hmm--

Whoa, whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
I think you got

the wrong idea here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
- Yeah, no, man. Whoa.

- Herb, I'm not--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<p>
Me either.

No, I just-- You know,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
- I caught up in the moment.

- Yeah, no, I gotcha.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<p>
BJ, can you believe it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
We're gonna make

an actual TV show!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:29" />

<p>
One that takes

an unflinching look

at the gritty reality

of the American family.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

Why would I say,

"You'll never get me

in that sweater"

in this scene

and then,

in the very next scene,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<p>
I'm wearing the sweater?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
Did my character suddenly forget

that he didn't want to wear

the sweater?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<p>
No, see,

that's actually the joke.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
Don't explain the joke to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
I just don't understand

how it's a joke.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<p>
So you do want me

to explain it to you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
I want you to add

a scene showing

how I changed my

mind about the sweater

so the goddamn episode

makes sense.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
Look at me,

doing your job for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
Way to go, Shakespeare.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
BJ, you're doing

the scene as written.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<p>
What happened

to the stories I requested?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
Where's my rap?

You said you'd write me a rap.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
We're working on it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<p>
We just need a rhyme for

"and I'm here to say."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<p>
Well, what about giving me

Rollerblades?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<p>
How are people gonna know

that my character is hip

if he doesn't roll the blade?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
Just get out there

and do your job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
Every one of your ideas

is stupid or racist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
That was one pitch,

and I didn't say

they're all thieves.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<p>
But if you're too scared

to start

a national dialogue,

maybe I'll take my ideas home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
Good luck making <i>Horsin' Around</i>

without the horse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<p>
BoJack, hon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<p>
That audience out there

traveled from all over

the country just

to taste some of your magic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<p>
Do you really want

to disappoint them?

Okay, Sharona.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

this limp script

<p>
Ha-ha.

She is attractive.

<p>
<i>Secretariat!</i>

<p>
It's happening,

to you and Val Kilmer

<p>
That's amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<p>
Hey, you know I wouldn't

ask if I didn't need it.

</p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<p>
That's great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<p>
We just gotta make sure

that we work in the phrase

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
"toothbrush rap" early,

so they know I'm rapping.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<p>
BoJack,

can we chat for a second?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
Ugh. Here we go.

It's the big one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<p>
I'm not gonna waste

your time with small talk

because you work for me,

and your time is my time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
We're letting Herb go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
- You can't do that.

- "I can't do that."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
I'm not asking you.

It's nothing personal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
I like Herb.

I think he's a good guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
But this is a business,

and every day

we don't fire him,

we're flushing money

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
- down the crapper.

- Well, if he goes, I go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<p>
"Well, if he goes, you go."

I wouldn't do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<p>
BoJack, I think you're a star,

and sometimes being a star

means making tough choices.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
You can storm out,

make a big show out of

what a "good" friend

you are,

or you could be

the guy who does his job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<p>
- Angela--

- I'll tell you when

it's your turn

to talk again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<p>
Look, you're a star,

but this is really just

the beginning of

the BoJack Horseman story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<p>
You can choose

whatever path you want,

but I'll tell you right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<p>
You don't win awards

and you don't

get to be on the covers

of magazines

and you don't get

to play the lead role

in the <i>Secretariat </i>movie

by being a good friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
What's that old expression

about how the show must go on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<p>
Oh, right.

It's "Don't be an idiot."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<p>
So what do you think, BoJack?

That's a courtesy question.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<p>
I already know what you think

because I have conversations

like this one five times a day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
I know who you are,

and I know

you've already

made your decision.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<p>
But if you want

to surprise me,

now's the time to do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<p>
That's what I thought.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
You're doing the right thing.

I know it's hard.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
But if Herb's really your

friend, he'll understand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<p>
Now, you've got

a show to put on,

so I'll let you get ready.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
This was a good conversation.

Productive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<p>
If you're lucky,

I'll never talk to you again.

</p>

<p>

with <i>Secretariat?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<p>
Went into turnaround.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<p>
I don't totally know

what "turnaround" means,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<p>
- but they never made the movie.

- Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
This house is way bigger

than yours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<p>
Herb's done really well

for a guy you dicked over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
- Oh, no. Ah.

- That's enough out of you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<p>

and turn this car around

in case we need to leave

in a hurry.

<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<p>
Have you been eating your guilt

this whole time?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
[all laugh]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<p>
Yeah, you don't look

so hot yourself, Herb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<p>
I have cancer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
And hello.

Who's this stunning creature?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<p>
And what string

of bad decisions

has placed you

in BoJack's orbit?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<p>
- Uh--

- This is Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
She's writing a book

about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
Pleasure to meet you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<p>
Is your book called,

<i>Portrait of an Asshole?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<p>
[laughs]

I kid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
It's funny,

because he ruined my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
I joke.

It's what I do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:20" />

<p>
Please, come in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
You're letting out

all the cancer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<p>
[forced laugh]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<p>
Ha ha...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<p>
Almost.

Ah...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<p>
Almost there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
Come on... ah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

- [bear growls]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<p>
BoJack, how are

your utensils?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
- Uh, they're fine.

- Are you sure?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<p>
Because if that knife

ain't sharp enough,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<p>
I got another that you left

in my back 20 years ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
- [laughs]

- Could have seen that coming.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
Who asks about utensils?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
I'm gonna go

to the bathroom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<p>
Nope. No, you are not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
Uh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
Oh. Ow. Almost.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<p>
[exciting music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<p>
- Drive, drive, drive!

- Oh. Oh, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
I can't turn

the car around.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<p>
I've been trying to do this

three-point turn forever.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<p>
I mean, it's more

like a 300-point turn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<p>
- Am I right, huh?

- Hee hee hee hee!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<p>
Hey, we've got two sacks

of Kardashian swag

and the fuzz on our heels.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<p>
You think this is Driver's Ed,

you hat-wearing pussy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
Drive the goddamn car!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<p>
[coughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<p>
Hey, Herb,

is that your Vitamix?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<p>
BoJack has one, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<p>
I wonder if you guys have

strong opinions about it

one way or the other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
Well, the stupid thing

was like 600 bucks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<p>
I have used mine

a grand total of zero times.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
I got it a month before

I was diagnosed with cancer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
I don't give a shit

about being healthy anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<p>
I don't even have cancer,

and I don't use it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
- So who's it for?

- Exactly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<p>
What is so great

about liquids?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<p>
Every article I read now is

"juice this" and "juice that."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
You know why?

Juice controls the media.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<p>
- Hey-ooh.

- [both laugh]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<p>
Can't this thing

go any faster?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
Uh, I'm going

as fast as I can.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<p>
[tires squealing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
Do you want me to get out?

Try to guide you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<p>
No, I think

I'm almost there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<p>
You're doing a great job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>
Kenzie, stop talking to him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<p>
Why? He's being nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<p>
Remember

the number one rule

of the Celebrity Stealing Club--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
- "No falling in love."

- Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<p>
That's your rule

for every club.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<p>
It's a good rule.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<p>
Whoa. Whoa, guys.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:16" />

<p>
I'm sensing a lot

of hostility here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
Maybe we should take

our masks off and actually talk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>
You want me to take

my mask off? Fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<p>
Happy?

I took my mask off.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<p>
Did you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<p>
Because I think

you're still wearing a mask.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<p>
[both] Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<p>
Oh, my God, Herb,

you met President Clinton?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<p>
Oh, yeah. Many times.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
Did you think that

I spent the last 20 years

on my couch just feeling

sorry for myself?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<p>
I mean, I did do that,

but I also started...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<p>
[coughs] a charity

to bring clean water

to millions of children

in Sub-Saharan Africa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<p>
Oh, wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<p>
I presented at

the Teen Choice Awards.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
Wait, is that Charlotte?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<p>
Yeah, yeah.

We kept in touch.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
You should actually

give her a call.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<p>
I'm sure she'd

love to hear from you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<p>
She looks good

for someone so old.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
She's three years younger

than you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<p>
- Exactly!

- [laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
- [coughs]

- Er?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<p>
Well, guys,

I'm pretty beat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<p>
I think I need to

head off to bed,

and I hope

I actually wake up later.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<p>
[coughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<p>
And it was actually nice

to see you, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<p>
You can see yourselves out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<p>
[chuckling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<p>
"Juice controls the media."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<p>
[chuckling]

I love it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<p>
So I guess in a sense

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
I'm running away

from the cops,

but I feel like in another,

truer sense,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
I'm running away from myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
- Truth. Truth.

- Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
Kenzie, do you have

anything to share?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
Just how amazing it feels

to finally

be honest for once.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
I could live a million lives,

and I'd never forget

this one afternoon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
Word.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
You know, I act all cool

and sophisticated

on the outside,

but on the inside,

I'm just Todd, you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<p>
But thanks to you guys,

I think I'm finally

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<p>
- ready to let my guard down.

- Do you hear that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<p>
- He's letting his guard down.

- Let's get him!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<p>
- [grunts]

- Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<p>
[both] Celebrity stealing club

strikes again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<p>
[upbeat music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
This-- This just doesn't

feel right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<p>
I should have brought

a bottle of wine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<p>
That's what adults do.

BoJack, damn it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
Is that what's bothering you,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<p>
- that you didn't bring wine?

- You're right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
I just would have drunk it

on the way here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<p>
This isn't about wine,

BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
If you have something

you need to say to someone,

you should do it

while you have the chance

because before you know it,

it'll be too late.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<p>
Is this one of those things

where we're talking

about Herb but we're actually

talking about something else?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<p>
- No, I was talking about Herb.

- Okay, good. Yeah, me, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
[cheerfully]

Hey, buddy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
You come back

for that Vitamix, you--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
[coughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<p>
Ooh, you should get that

looked at.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
Yeah. I've been meaning

to see a doctor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
Hey, I wanted to talk

to you about... you know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
I feel bad about

what happened.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
So you're apologizing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
Yes. I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
Okay.

I don't forgive you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
Herb, I said I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
Yeah,

and I do not forgive you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<p>
Uh... not sure you get

what's happening here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:09" />

<p>
This could be

the last time that you--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
No. I'm not gonna

give you closure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
You don't get that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
[coughs]

You have to live

with the shitty thing

you did

for the rest of your life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
You have to know that

it's never,

ever going to be okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<p>
I really think that

we'd both

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<p>
- feel better if we just--

- I'm dying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
I'm not gonna feel better,

and I'm not gonna be your prop

so you can feel better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
You have to believe me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
- I did everything I could.

- Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<p>
Then why didn't you call me?

Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
20 years--

You didn't call me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<p>
Look, I-- I wanted to,

but I didn't think--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
You know what

it was like for me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<p>
I had nobody.

Everybody left.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<p>
I knew all those showbiz phonies

would turn on me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
Sure. But you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
It's not my fault

you got fired.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
I don't care about the job!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<p>
I did fine.

I had a good life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<p>
But what I needed then

was a friend,

and you abandoned me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
And I will never forgive you

for that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
Now, get the fuck

out of my house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<p>
Hey, this is a dumb question,

but the gay thing

and the rectal cancer thing

aren't related, are they?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
- Get out of here!

- Never mind.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<p>
Stupid question.

Forget I brought it up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
- Huh.

- Hey, BJ.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
- Put that back, asshole!

- No, you gave this to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
- [growls]

- No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<p>
[both grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
[Diane] BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<p>
What are you doing?

Get off him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<p>
The show was never the same

after I left. Admit it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<p>
Some people prefer

the later years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
- [growling]

- BoJack. Come on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<p>
- [panting]

- Thank you for inviting us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
You have a lovely home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<p>
You know what

your problem is?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
You want to think of yourself

as the good guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
Well, I know you better

than anyone,

and I can tell you

that you're not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
In fact, you'd probably sleep

a lot better at night

if you just admitted

to yourself

that you're a selfish

goddamn coward

who takes whatever he wants

and doesn't give a shit

about who he hurts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<p>
That's you.

That's BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<p>
I don't know why I came here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
Yeah. You do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
[engine revs, tires screech]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
[Princess Carolyn]

<i>You said you wanted a job.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<p>
It doesn't matter.

Nothing matters.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<p>
Wow.

What happened in Malibu?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
- I gotta go.

- [phone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
Hey, bright side.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
At least now you have

a good story to tell

at his funeral.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<p>
Ugh, God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<p>
I'm not trying

to kill the vibe here,

but I've had to pee

for, like, three hours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<p>
Look, I won't put

what happened today

in the book

if you don't want me to.
