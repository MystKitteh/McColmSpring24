[woman] Yeah, you'll never

guess who's here.

Think '90s.

<line>
No, BoJack Horseman

from <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
No, I mean,

he got a little fatter,

but it's definitely him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<line>
He looks really sad.

It's hilarious.

BoJack,

it's your favorite agent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<line>
Yeah, some agent,

you couldn't even get me

in the room for <i>War Horse.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<line>
There were, like,

ten horses in that movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<line>
I didn't need

to be the warhorse.

Listen, dummy, I want

to make sure you're all set

for your first day

with Diane tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
Is she gonna ask me

a bunch of personal questions?

<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<line>
The woman we're paying

to ghostwrite your memoir?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<line>
Yeah, probably.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<line>
Okay, all right,

there's no need to get--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<line>
What, catty?

Are you gonna say catty?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<line>
- I was not gonna say catty.

- Oh, what were you gonna say?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<line>
I was gonna say catty

because you're a cat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>
Goodbye, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

Laura, I know you're

listening. You got it, right?

<line>
Laura, do not respond to him.

Goodbye, BoJack.

</line>

She got it.

<line>
Take another one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<line>
Excuse me,

I just wanted you to know

that you ruined

someone else's night tonight,

and I hope

you have enough decency

to at least feel

a little bit crappy about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<line>
Excuse me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<line>
I was actually

already in a bad mood,

but I thought maybe

for one night,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:55" />

<line>
I could go out to a bar

and try to forget about myself,

but now because of you

and your friends,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<line>
I feel more self-conscious

than ever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<line>
If we were bothering you

so much,

why didn't you just leave?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:05" />

<line>
Because I didn't think

of that, and now I feel stupid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<line>
Look, I have a right

to be here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:09" />

<line>
No!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<line>
Maybe because you're skinny

and maybe 'cause you're pretty,

you're used to getting away

with things,

but I want you to know

that your actions

have an effect on others,

and I hate you,

and you are a horrible person,

and you not understanding

that you're a horrible person

doesn't make you

less of a horrible person.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:29" />

<line>
You think I'm pretty?

No, but I was

going to buy them.

That's the last box,

<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<line>
Yeah, dibs.

<line>
Look, I don't even

want the muffins.

if you put muffins down,

they're not your muffins.

<line>
So what, I was supposed

to take them

into the bathroom with me?

You didn't even

put the muffins in a cart.

I want the muffins.

<line>
Okay, let's get to work.

Let's start

at the beginning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<line>
What was your childhood like?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
- Normal.

- Normal?

normal childhood stuff.

<line>
Here's your omelet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<line>
I'm sorry it's not as good

as the omelets

your secretary makes,

but then you're not married

to your secretary, are you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
Well, maybe if my secretary

also refused to get an abortion,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
I would be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<line>
Mommy,

can I have an omelet?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
You're the birthday boy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
Normal childhood,

and then just get right

into the big, famous part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<line>
Look, if you're not

ready to talk, we can wait.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
I am ready to talk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<line>
Why wouldn't I want

to talk about my parents?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<line>
They're so normal.

That's crazy.

<line>
Is that what you want to hear?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
Neal, was it

a small container of muffins,

like two to four muffins?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
No, Tom, there were

a good deal more than that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
Can you remember exactly how

many muffins were in the box?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<line>
Yeah, there were exactly 12!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
I ate 12 muffins,

and I didn't even want one!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

If I want to be alone,

I have to go to the roof

because it's the only place they

don't have insurance to film.

<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
You go on the roof?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

I used to climb onto the roof

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<line>
That's some shoddy

craftsmanship, son.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
- I tried my best.

- No, you didn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<line>
You slacked off

and took the easy way out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
In this world,

you can either

do things the easy way

or the right way.

<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<line>
- What?

- What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

I asked if you were close

with your father,

and you sat here in silence

for five minutes

and then said, "Uneventful."

You know what, this is

a really good conversation,

<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<line>
<i>Uh, nope.</i>

[tires screech]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<line>
So where are we going?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<line>
Don't worry,

I've got a plan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<line>
[tires screech]

Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<line>
Jeez.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<line>
Ayako, hey, I need you to get

me three tickets to Kyoto.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<line>
<i>[speaking Japanese]</i>

<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<line>
You told me you were

an obscenely rich

American entrepreneur.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:17" />

<line>
You had eighty dollars

in your bank account.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<line>
Eighty!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<line>
Hey, I meant I was rich

because I have friends

like George Bailey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<line>
[speaking Japanese]

Who the shit is George Bailey?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
Do you have any idea how much

work went into scamming you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<line>
<i>George Bailey!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:32" />

<line>
Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<line>
Well, I'm out of ideas.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<line>
We can hide out at my place

while we make a plan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<line>
Yeah, great, just get me away

from the cameras.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<line>
Do we really need

to be filming this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<line>
It's for my reality show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<line>
You never know

when gold's gonna strike.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:52" />

<line>
Yeah, gold doesn't strike.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<line>
That's why you never know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<line>
BoJack, be nice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<line>
Just pretend

they're not there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<line>
Okay. Well, I--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
Could you speak up, please?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<line>
- I'd like to--

- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<line>
That's too loud.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<line>
I want to fix this

as quickly as possible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<line>
I don't care who was right

about the muffins anymore,

even though I was

definitely right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<line>
I just want my privacy back,

so I can finish writing

my tell-all memoir, so everyone

will pay attention to me again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<line>
I've already reached out

to the McBeal camp.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
He's willing to publicly forgive

you if you publicly apologize

and present to him

a box of muffins as a symbol

of your great admiration

for the American military

and everything they do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<line>
But I ate the muffins.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<line>
I know.

We got another box.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<line>
It's in the cupboard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<line>
Oh, you were saving those?

I ate those too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<line>
We've been here

for ten minutes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<line>
It's okay,

we'll get more muffins.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<line>
I'll get the muffins,

and they're on me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
I just found out

I got 80 bucks in the bank.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<line>
I'm helping!

Hooray!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
So where are

we gonna do this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<line>
Do I have to go on MSNBSea?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<line>
No, we should do it somewhere

people will actually see it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<line>
Oh, why don't you do it

on <i>Peanutbutter and Jelly</i>?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<line>
You can't call a show

<i>Peanutbutter and Jelly</i>

if there's no jelly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<line>
It's a pun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<line>
It's not a pun

if it only works one way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<line>
Is this

a necessary conversation

to be having right now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<line>
Look, I know

tempers are high,

but let's not take it out

on the great title

for my reality show,

which we all agree

is really clever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
We can edit this to make me

look smart, right?

<line>
- Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<line>
Well, here I am, hanging out

with my good friend

BoJack Horseman,

enjoying

each other's company,

as we often do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<line>
Yes, this is all

very authentic and natural.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<line>
[doorbell rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
Oh, someone's at the door!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<line>
I will see who it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<line>
Wow, this is a surprise.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<line>
Neal McBeal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<line>
Hello, sir.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<line>
Thank you for inviting me

into your home. It is lovely.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
BoJack, is there anything

you'd like to give Neal McBeal?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<line>
Ahem.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
Oh, yeah, Todd?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<line>
What the hell is this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<line>
I tried to buy the muffins,

but my bank card got declined

for some reason.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<line>
But don't worry,

I still saved the day

because I found this bag

of stale hamburger buns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<line>
I'm sorry?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<line>
Yeah, they're just giving them

away behind In-N-Out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<line>
Why does anybody

pay for anything?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<line>
Ow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<line>
Uh, Neal, as a token

of my admiration,

please accept this bag

of stale hamburger buns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
- What?

- Yes, hamburger buns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<line>
It's a symbol

for how we throw our veterans

in the trash, sadly,

far too often.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<line>
I'm listening.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<line>
We send

our muffins overseas,

and they come back

as stale hamburger buns,

but that doesn't mean

we should love them any less,

because in their own way,

aren't stale hamburger buns

just as good?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
Mmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<line>
American made.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<line>
So what you're saying is,

you think I'm a hero.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
Well, I don't know if I--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
Say it, BoJack.

Say I'm a hero.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<line>
You're a hero.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<line>
The troops are all heroes,

every single one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:09" />

<line>
Great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<line>
And I don't believe

saying that cheapens the word

and actually disrespects

those we mean to honor

by turning real people

into political pawns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<line>
Okay, you can let go

of the bag now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<line>
Also, I am not

deeply ambivalent

about a seemingly mandated

celebration of our military

by a nation

that claims to value peace

telling our children that

violence is never the answer

while refusing to hold our own

government to the same standard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<line>
Yeah, me neither.

I think we're in agreement here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<line>
Furthermore, I do not find

it unbelievably appropriate

that this conversation is taking

place on reality television,

a genre which thrives on

chopping the complexities

of our era

into easily digestible chunks

of empty catchphrases.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<line>
And finally, I don't--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<line>
Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbutter

got a bucket stuck on his head.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<line>
Guys, guys, where am I?

Can someone tell me where I am?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<line>
Hey, where'd he get

that bucket from?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<line>
Who gave him a bucket?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<line>
[laughter]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<line>
Uh, actually, I had

another point I wanted to make.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<line>
Yeah, but who doesn't love

a dog with a bucket on his head?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<line>
Come on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<line>
Bucket! Bucket!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<line>
[crowd] Bucket!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
Bucket! Bucket!

Bucket! Bucket!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<line>
Hey, can anyone

find a handle?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<line>
[howls]

[all cheer]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<line>
Oh, thank you, my friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<line>
You're a real hero.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<line>
Unbelievable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<line>
What's your name, young lady?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<line>
Well, my real name's Angela,

but my friends call me Jelly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
What?

Oh, my God, did we get that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<line>
Please tell me we got that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<line>
[chuffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<line>
You want

a day-old hamburger bun?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<line>
I'm all right.

How'd it go down there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<line>
You know what the problem is

with everybody?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<line>
They all just want to hear

what they already believe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<line>
No one ever wants

to hear the truth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<line>
I want to hear the truth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<line>
I don't know if you want

to tell it, though.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
What do you mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<line>
Mr. Normal Childhood,

Mr. Uneventful Father?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<line>
Look, I can write you

the standard

empty-calorie celebrity

tell-some,

if that's what

you're looking for,

but I thought you

might want more than that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
I do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<line>
Well, then you're going

to have to open up

and give me something real.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<line>
What, you think

I can't open up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
Well, I don't know

if you can or not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<line>
You certainly haven't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<line>
Okay, from now on,

full truth, warts and all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<line>
You're not gonna make me look

like an asshole, are you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<line>
I don't know,

are you an asshole?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<line>
Okay, full truth,

here we go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<line>
You want to know

about my parents?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<line>
They drank a lot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<line>
My father was

a failed novelist.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<line>
My mother was the heiress to the

Sugarman sugar cubes fortune,

and my dad

resented her for it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<line>
He used to make me cry

with him

while listening

to Cole Porter records.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<line>
He made me build

my own tree house,

and then he tore it down

while I was at summer camp

because instead of

hearty, Christian nails,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<line>
I used screws,

which he called fancy Jew nails.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<line>
Like I said, totally normal.
