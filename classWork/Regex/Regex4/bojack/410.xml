Nothing gets by me, Tina.

Uno what I'm thinking?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<line>
-[mutters]

-I don't think you have any blues.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
I think you put the wild card down,

and chose blue,

because you want us

to think you have blues.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<line>
-Just go already!

-Uh, excuse me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<line>
I am employing

a little something called "strategy."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<line>
I am taking my time because

I enjoy being the center of attention.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<line>
Until I put a card down,

you have to listen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<line>
It's been your turn

for ten minutes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<line>
Well, since you're being so impatient,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<line>
I'm gonna put my thing down,

flip it and reverse it back to Tina.

Henrietta, don't use a foreign language

She'll get ideas.

-It's your turn, Beatrice.

-Ah, ah, ah, ah!

<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<line>
-You okay, Hollyhock?

-Yeah, I'm-- I'm awesome.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<line>
I feel really good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<line>
I just-- I need a glass of water.

<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<line>
Oh! Beatrice, trying to slip

a nine on a six.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
You think I've never seen

an old niner-sixer before?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<line>
-Ah! Ow!

-Whoa, are-- are you okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<line>
I'm fine! I just-- Ow!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<line>
Did you cut yourself?

It's okay. I know what to do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
You need some alcohol, ice,

a squeeze of lemon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<line>
-You'll forget all about your cut.

-I'll be right back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

One.

{\an8}<i>Before Woodchuck,</i>

<i>the hands belonged to one</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>Ernest Contralto, a criminal.</i>

<i>The man was a pedophile murderer.</i>

<line>
<i>Well, if you gotta murder somebody...</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<line>
<i>No, Tom. Not a pedophile-dash-murderer.</i>

<i>A pedophile-slash-murderer!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
<i>Oh, no! The way you said "slash"</i>

<i>was very scary!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<line>
<i>At first I didn't like him,</i>

<i>on account, uh... he didn't have hands?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<line>
<i>But then he got new hands,</i>

<i>so I liked him again?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
<i>But then I found out those hands are bad!</i>

<i>Can't trust politicians.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
She's killing us on this hands thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<line>
{\an8}Much like Ernest Contralto

killed those innocent children

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<line>
{\an8}after he pedophiled them,

with those very hands.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
Not helping!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<line>
Your hands are being

really aggressive right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<line>
-[groans]

-Watch out! They're attacking your face!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<line>
Hey, girl, whatcha working on?

Getting some clicks?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
Get them clicks, girl.

Get. Them. Clicks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm working on another big piece

about how Jessica Biel is owned

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<line>
{\an8}by private prison lobbyists, who want--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<line>
Oh, my Gaia, Diane, nobody cares.

I care and I don't even care.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
So imagine how little

someone who doesn't care cares.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<line>
-Well...

-What if you had lunch with her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<line>
{\an8}-Why would--

-You could write about

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
{\an8}what she smells like,

how she makes her face pretty.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<line>
{\an8}These are things people will want

to know about our first female governor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<line>
{\an8}Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
[screeching]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
I'll have the avocado toast.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<line>
{\an8}But instead of the avocado part,

I want fresh sea air,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<line>
{\an8}and instead of the toast,

I'll have a single grain of rice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
{\an8}-And for you?

-Grilled cheese?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<line>
Thank you for meeting me here, Diane.

I just wanted to tell you,

you can keep writing

whatever you want about me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
Obviously, it has no effect on the polls,

because the only thing voters care about

is stupid bullshit, so knock yourself out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<line>
Well, today I just want to know

what you smell like.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<line>
It's actually my new fragrance:

"Bielist," by Jessica Biel.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
-Your perfume's called "B"-list?

-"Bielist."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
"B"-list. Like a "B"-list celebrity.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<line>
-No, "Bielist" like Jessica Biel.

-I think we're saying the same thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
{\an8}Do you want some?

I got a whole trunk of this stuff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
{\an8}-No, thanks.

-You sure?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
{\an8}Mr. Peanutbutter always loved

the way I smelled.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<line>
{\an8}Well, I wouldn't flatter

yourself too much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<line>
{\an8}He's very enthusiastic

about smelling in general.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<line>
{\an8}He's enthusiastic about everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
Oh, my God. Does he still have

that dumb magic eye poster?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
What? No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
When we were married,

he was obsessed with it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<line>
And he would make me

stare at it for hours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<line>
Yeah, I bet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
But then, all of a sudden, I saw it.

And it was incredible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<line>
And I was so happy

that I had waited long enough

to experience this beautiful thing,

and I felt so...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<line>
Why is this disgusting avocado

on my plate?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<line>
-Oh, I...

-I feel personally attacked right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<line>
-Oh, so sorry.

-[retches]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<line>
Anyway,

as I was saying about the poster,

it's funny how something so stupid

could have this tremendous power.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<line>
You know what I mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
Yeah. I think I do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
Yeah, who'da thunk it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
Who knew?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
I knew. I put the avocado thing

in the story on purpose,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<line>
I knew people wouldn't like it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<line>
So just for the record, I "thunk" it.

Even though it doesn't matter.

I don't need credit.

But it does, if I didn't do that,

it wouldn't have happened.

It would be funnier

if your name was Betty Buenaventura

Well, I'm sorry you don't find

my name sufficiently comical,

but this is actually

a very serious matter.

<line>
-Oh.

-We've received complaints

from several concerned parents.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<line>
It seems that many

of your clown dentists

aren't actually licensed

to practice medicine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<line>
Isn't laughter the <i>best</i> medicine?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<line>
No. It is the worst medicine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<line>
If you can even call it medicine,

which, legally, you cannot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<line>
Well, what if I said my business

was for entertainment purposes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<line>
That would require your employees

to be entertaining.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<line>
According to your reviews on Yelp,

your clown dentists are, quote,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
"A cotton candy nightmare of Freudian

invention that shakes one to the core."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
Ah, everyone's a critic.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<line>
On Yelp? Yes, that is the idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<line>
It appears your business provides

no service but to terrify children

and the adults who accompany them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<line>
If this were October,

you could market your venture

as some sort of spooky

Halloween experience,

but since this is January,

a month which, to my knowledge,

contains no Halloweens,

I have no choice but to--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<line>
Wait! Wait.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<line>
What if my clown dentists

put on a show?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<line>
A delightful, whimsical,

non-terrifying clown-stravaganza?

<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<line>
You would have to agree

we were a legitimate

business then, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<line>
-Go on.

-Give us a week. We'll put on a show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
If you don't laugh,

I'll dissolve the business

and release all my clown dentists

into the woods,

where they'll never bother anyone again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
All right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<line>
You have one week to create a show

that delights and astonishes me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
But I should warn you,

I am a very tough crowd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
I once met Paul Rudd at a cocktail party

and I did not find him charming.

<line>
-Get outta my way.

-Like, hooked in a funny way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<line>
You call that funny?

That's not funny. It's sad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<line>
Well, some would argue

that sad and funny

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
-are two sides of the same coin.

-[cries out]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<line>
Uh, no! Abraham Lincoln

and some weird flat house

are two sides of the same coin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>
-Take five, Picarello.

-[bell ringing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:16" />

<line>
[groans] I've got a week

to whip these dentists into clowns.

</line>

<line>
Why not? I got no baby or boyfriend.

Might as well get blotto, right? [hiccups]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<line>
-Um, shouldn't you be at work?

-I'm recal-bibrating.

</line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<line>

-Ohh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<line>
Hey, maybe you should--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
-[phone buzzing]

-Judah, look at my phone! Judah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:48" />

<line>
-You have a meeting with Flip McVicker.

-[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<line>
Tell his gal I'm running ten minutes late.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<line>
What gal?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<line>
-So, you're a writer?

-Oh, actually that's a typo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<line>
It should say "Waiter."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<line>
-But I'm an aspiring writer.

-Uh-huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<line>
Sorry, that was a joke.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
That's the kind of witty repartee

you can expect from--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<line>
Yeah, yeah.

Thanks for the business card.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
Wait, ya know,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<line>
-I have this idea for a TV show.

-Oh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<line>
It's a grizzled former detective

who gets sucked back in--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
This sounds fabulous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
Why don't you write a script,

we'll go from there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<line>
-I already wrote it. Boom.

-Oh, you brought it with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<line>
I don't trust email.

You know, the government.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
Yeah. Look, Flip, before I even read this,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<line>
I should tell you

that this town's a total crapshoot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
Odds of the right person

finding your material

and connecting with it

are a million to... one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<line>
I just know I have this great potential

inside me. I know I can do it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<line>
Even if no one else understands

or believes in me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<line>
I'm sure that sounds pretty stupid but...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<line>
It's not stupid. I believe in you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<line>
I don't know how else to describe it

other than this feeling

of supreme warmth came over me,

like this is what I've been waiting for

my whole life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<line>
That's amazing!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<line>
Todd, the world is dark and scary

and full of creepy clown dentists...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<line>
They're working very hard

to be less creepy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<line>
But when I hold this script in my hands,

I have hope.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<line>
I gotta get this made.

What do I always say?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<line>
"What's the difference

between an agent and a manager?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<line>
Uh, managers are always

talking about the differences

between agents and managers

and agents don't as much?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
No! Managers can produce!

This script is a sign.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<line>
I gotta get off my ass

and produce this baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
Todd? [hiccups]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<line>
Get me a meeting with Turtletaub.

Set something up with his gal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
Who is this gal?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
Okay. Clentists, assemble!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<line>
[clowns clamoring]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
Wipe those serious looks

off your faces and listen up!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<line>
We gotta help Princess Carolyn,

but also we gotta prep

for our big show next week.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<line>
If only there was a way

to do both at once.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<line>
What a ludicrous notion!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<line>
Doctor Picarello,

we might make a clown out of you yet!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<line>
Oh, joy!

This next part is critical. Remain wacky.

This is a highly frivolous situation!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
-What's in the package?

-It's a hand delivery item.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<line>
Hey!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<line>
-Now, Doctor Boing Boing!

-I am in position.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<line>
[straining]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<line>
All right, Princess Carolyn, sit tight.

<line>
-[grunts]

-Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<line>
-Princess Carolyn!

-Lenny, thanks for making time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<line>
Didn't realize I had.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<line>
[sniffing] Are you drunk?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<line>
You smell like somebody

tried to put out a fire

at the booze factory with more booze.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<line>
Uh, new perfume, "Sealist," by Seal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<line>
Now let's get to brass stacks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<line>
So it's a hot young writer.

It's TV. It's me producing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<line>
-"TV?"

-Just look at this script.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<line>
I know it's gonna knock your socks off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<line>
Eh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<line>
Know that website,

"What-time-is-it-right-now-dot-com,"

you go to when you want

to know what time it is?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<line>
Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<line>
They look to make a play

in the gritty prestige streaming world,

and it could make a big splash

with a huge ad buy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<line>
Plus, you got the built-in audience

who don't know what time it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<line>
That's huge! That's so many people!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<line>
Yeah, yeah, this could be perfect

as their first series,

but we'd have to get in fast.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<line>
They wanna premiere

before Daylight Savings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

Let's set the pitch for next week.

<timestamp data-time="00:14:38" />

<line>
<i>Philbert?</i> Who's Philbert?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<line>
He's this grizzled

but very good-looking detective

who gets sucked back in to something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<line>
No, I mean who <i>is </i>he?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<line>
-You got a star attached?

-Not yet, but...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
Eh, we can't go in without a big name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<line>
TV pitching is like the Israeli flag,

it's nothing without a big star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:53" />

<line>
Sorry, Princess Carolyn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<line>
No! Fish!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<line>
Oh, whoa... ooh, spinny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<line>
Uh-oh! She is out like sauerkraut.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<line>
[mimics static] Don't let Turtletaub

get back to his office.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

for the "Waltz of the Rubber Chicken"!

You gotta be kidding me.

<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

<line>
Okay, okay, how about Aaron Eckhart?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<line>
He owes me a favor

and he can disappear into any role.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

Yeah, he can disappear so good,

the audience disappears with him.

And then you get him playing

now there's a show that screams,

But if we're going to convince Yolanda

Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />

<line>
Here we go, baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<line>
Oh, man!

You are not finding what you need!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<line>
The deck is a harsh mistress, Tina.

Hollyhock, you gotta get in here!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<line>
Tina is drawing so many cards.

It's amazing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
Hollyhock! Hollyhock?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<line>
-[body thuds in distance]

-Hollyhock?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
[woman] That's her name?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<line>
Yes, for the third time,

her name is "Hollyhock."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<line>
And her last name?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
Manheim-Mannheim, uh, Steamroller...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<line>
Is there more?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<line>
I think there's a Lopez

in the mix somewhere?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
A Chung maybe?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<line>
I'm sorry, sir, I can't help you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<line>
Okay, just... any information

you can give me

on the 17-year-old horse girl

who came here by ambulance

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
15 minutes ago would be

of interest to my friend,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<line>
Mr. Franklin's... friend, Mr. Hamilton.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<line>
If you can't prove you're

her parent or legal guardian,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<line>
I can't release any information to you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<line>
-Guerrero!

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<line>
Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...

Robinson...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<line>
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack.

That's her name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<line>
And she's about five-eight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<line>
And she's 17,

her birthday is in September.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<line>
And... she looks like me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
And she loves apples

but hates apple sauce.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<line>
And she's funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
But she isn't mean.

Which is pretty remarkable,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<line>
'cause a lot of 17-year-olds think

you have to be mean to be funny,

but Hollyhock is very sweet,

even if she can be sarcastic.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<line>
But she has this smile with...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<line>
Does that help?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
No, man.

Are you her legal guardian?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
I'm not leaving here

until I get to see her.

</line>

<line>
We have to think

what's best for Hollyhock.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<line>
-Hollyhock is going to be okay.

-Excuse me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<line>
Jose Guerrero.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
Hello, yes! Yeah. Thank God you're here.

I'm BoJack Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<line>
Yeah, we know.

I'm her dad, Steve Mannheim.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<line>
I'm the wrong Mannheim to mess with.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<line>
I'm Dashawn Manheim.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<line>
I'm probably

the right Manheim to mess with,

unless we're talking about

a dance battle, in which case...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<line>
Five, six, seven, eight. Ha!

</line>

-You've been warned.

-Okay. Yep.

I think you're just ghastly,

and I was against

this whole caper from the bell.

</line>

<line>
-Okay.

-Otto Zilberschlag.

-I'm Gregory Hsung.

That's my deal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
And I'm Quackers!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<line>
-Quack, quack, quack!

-Easy, Quackers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<line>
How's Hollyhock?

They wouldn't give me information.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<line>
-Why would they? You're not her dad.

-No, I know. I just... Is she okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<line>
She will be.

The doctor said she's lucky to be alive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<line>
What happened?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
-She overdosed.

-What? No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
How could you let this happen?

Quack, quack!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
-Quackers! Settle down.

-What was she on? I had no idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<line>
You had no idea?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
Have you looked at her?

She's as thin as a pole.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<line>
You know I don't care

for your Polish jokes, Dashawn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<line>
She told us you were

taking care of her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<line>
-I was.

-I knew she was too young

to be on her own like this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<line>
She's a child!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<line>
She called Pedro Almodóvar's

<i>I'm So Excited</i> "excessively kitsch."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<line>
-Kitsch <i>is</i> excessive! That's the point!

-Can I see her? Can I talk to her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<line>
-You're lucky we don't call the police!

-Quack, quack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<line>
Our kid got hooked on amphetamines

because of you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<line>
-No, I didn't...

-Quack, quack, quack, quack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<line>
Okay, I feel like there's a lot

of male energy right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<line>
Why don't I come back in a couple hours?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
Give Hollyhock a chance to rest

before I talk to her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
Are you insane?

You are never seeing Hollyhock again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

-Never.

Where did I put her?

<line>
Oh, Henrietta,

would you help me pack this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<line>
-I want to bring it to my son.

-Thanks, Mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<line>
-It's for my son.

-Right. How did I not see it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
All this time, I thought

you were a terrible parent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<line>
And you were.

But I blew it even worse.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<line>
It turns out being a parent is impossible,

so I guess I can't be that mad at you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
Mad at me? No, Henrietta,

this is the right thing. You'll see.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<line>
Maybe we deserve each other.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

Where is the girl?

I made the girl coffee.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<line>

-This whole time.

<line>
Just until she learned to take it herself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<line>
-Of course it was you.

-Henrietta!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />

<line>
No. All this "I-don't-know-where-I-am

or-who-my-son-stuff" is,

is officially not cute anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<line>
You ruined the one good thing I had.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<line>
The one thing I didn't ruin myself,

but of course I did

because I thought it was a good idea

to give you one more chance.
