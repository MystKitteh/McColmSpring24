<p>
[BoJack] <i>Sarah Lynn.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:07" />

<p>
<i>Sarah Lynn?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<p>
[stammers] <i>I don't have a lot to tell.</i>

<i>She called me.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
<i>She sounded a little off. I... </i>[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
<i>So, I drove to the planetarium,</i>

<i>and I found her passed out.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
<i>I called 911 right away,</i>

<i>but it was too late.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
{\an8}[crickets chirping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<p>
-I'm so sorry.

-[cries]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
I did everything I could.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
It's my fault. I'm a terrible mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<p>
-No. It's no one's fault.

-[sobs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<p>
So, you don't know

where Sarah Lynn got the heroin from?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
-I have no idea.

-Alrighty then.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<p>
That's the only question I had.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<p>
I mean, of course I knew

she was doing a lot of drugs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
But that's who she was. Who I was.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
It felt like we could keep

partying forever

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
-and it wouldn't catch up with us.

-Got it. Don't need any more information.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
I was in a bad way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<p>
And Sarah Lynn followed me down

because she thought I was a safe place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<p>
What have I done?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
Just to be clear, the case is closed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
You can stop rambling.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<p>
[whistles tune]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<p>
I gotta make some changes in my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
Starting now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

{\an8}[bell dinging]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<p>
-I need help. Hello? Ah!

-Checking in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<p>
-Welcome to Pastiches Malibu!

-Great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<p>
I see you have the six-week package, so...

a hundred thousand dollars, please!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:48" />

<p>
{\an8}A hundred thou-- Jesus!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<p>
{\an8}Does every room come

with a free bag full of $90,000?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:53" />

<p>
{\an8}-Can't put a price on clean living.

-And yet somehow you found a way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:57" />

<p>
{\an8}Before I take you to your room,

could we get a selfie?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:59" />

<p>
{\an8}What? No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<p>
Every client that comes here

takes a picture with me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />

<p>
{\an8}Goes on the wall. Kind of a tradition...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm not in the mood.

I look awful, first of all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<p>
Johnny Depp did it, and he looked

just as puffy and ghoulish as you do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<p>
{\an8}Hey, groundhog. I said no.

Why don't you go see your own shadow

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<p>
{\an8}so I can get six more weeks

of "Leave Me the Hell Alone"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:19" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm so sorry, sir.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:21" />

<p>
{\an8}Thank you.

Now if you'll kindly direct me to my room,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:23" />

<p>
{\an8}I would like to begin

the process of healing,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:26" />

<p>
{\an8}so I can finally stop hurting

the people around me, dipshit!

<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
So, when I went to the country club

for Sheila's luncheon...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
Yes. Let it out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
{\an8}I had to wear the same suit

I had just worn to Sandra's tea party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
{\an8}-Yeah.

-[woman] Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
{\an8}I think of that as my rock bottom. [sobs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<p>
Denise, thank you

for sharing your story. So brave.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<p>
Denise, we are powerless

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<p>
-over our addictions

-Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
{\an8}We have a saying in rehab,

"Everyone takes a different road

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
{\an8}to get to the same city,

Soberopolis, USA."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<p>
Hold on a sec. What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<p>
{\an8}BoJack, maybe you could tell us

when was the first time you drank?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
When wasn't the first time I drank?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
{\an8}-Am I right?

-[all laugh]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
Your last day's tomorrow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
You think you're ready

to go back into the world?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<p>
I do. I feel good, I feel clear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<p>
You know, just because you cleaned

the tobacco out of your teeth

don't mean it's your wedding day,

pardon the expression.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
I don't believe that is an expression.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<p>
I notice you tend to deflect

whenever I ask you

about the source of your addiction.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<p>
I don't deflect.

Hey, is that a new tie? Because I love it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<p>
You understand a joke about deflection

is still a deflection, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
I came here to take responsibility

for myself,

and all I keep hearing is,

"It's not your fault,

you are powerless over your addiction."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
-That is the first step.

-And while we're at it, why 12 steps?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<p>
That is way too many.

Nobody wants to do 12 of anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<p>
Did you see <i>12 Years a Slave</i>

and think, "Twelve. That's a short number

of years to be a slave"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
-You're deflecting again.

-I'm here because I made choices.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
Nobody made me drink.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<p>
My addiction didn't pull a knife on me

and say, "Hey, bub! Drink this alcohol,

or I'm gonna strangle you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<p>
After I put down this knife,

which now seems unnecessary."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
-We have a saying in the sober community.

-No kidding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<p>
"We want what our addictions

want us to want,

in the same way that our future

is just a house built from the materials

of our present on the blueprint

that is our past."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
See, usually the point of sayings

is they illustrate complicated concepts

via straightforward allegory.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
I really admire

that your sayings don't do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<p>
If you don't wanna be here,

you don't have to wait until tomorrow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
The gate code is 12,

for the number of steps,

then my mom's birthday,

which is March 4th, '56.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
So, the gate code

is one, two, three, four, five, six?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<p>
You can leave whenever you'd like.

But is that really what you want?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
[sighs] No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<p>
It's so beautiful.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
And I know a lot about art

because my husband owns

a Jackson Pollock. [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
My dad owns a signed picture

of Kevin Pollak.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<p>
-[yelps]

-What about you, BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<p>
Did you grow up in a house

with a lot of art?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
Well, my parents practiced

the art of being terrible parents.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<p>
[laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<p>
BoJack, you can't joke your way

through this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
Everyone else in this group

is trying hard to be honest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
Really? Everyone's being honest?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
Doug over here,

who keeps dressing in a suit and tie

even though he's never getting

his finance job back?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
-[woman gasps]

-Oh! Savage!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
And Joan Tripplehorn?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
We all know you're just Jeanne Tripplehorn

wearing fake glasses!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<p>
-[all gasp]

-[chuckles] What? No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<p>
I'm Jeanne's identical twin Joan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<p>
Mm, Jeanne Tripplehorn. Not an alcoholic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
And that guy with the fake mustache

is obviously actor Jay Hernandez

who's just here to do research for a role.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<p>
-[all gasp]

-No. I'm a no "Hernandez."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
Like I say, my name is Mario.

Directed by Zack Snyder.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<p>
I'm addicted to pain pills from breaking

too many bricks on my head.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
BoJack's right! You all suck!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
-Yeah, well, let's talk about Jameson.

-Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
-I'd rather you not.

-She would love to get sober

but still has her friend McCaitlyn

sneak her water bottles

filled with vodka every visiting day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<p>
-[all gasp]

-Jameson?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<p>
-Um...

-Have you been smuggling in alcohol?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
How is this my fault?

I blame water for being vodka-colored!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<p>
This is your fifth time in rehab.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<p>
-Maybe it's a sign it's not working, huh?

-BoJack...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
Everyone, just as a general rule,

if you're checking into rehab

more than once,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<p>
-either you're a lost cause...

-[all gasp]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<p>
...or this is just an industry

that profits off of repeat customers,

so maybe they don't have

your best interest at heart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<p>
-Oh!

-How's that for honest?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<p>
Mamma mia.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
-[blows]

-[door opens]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
Hey, snitch! I only sneak in vodka

because I have to make it through

six weeks of this bullshit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<p>
I don't even need to be here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<p>
My dad totally overreacted

when he found me not breathing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<p>
Yeah, it's always

someone else's fault, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<p>
-You have no idea what I've been through.

-I know everything you've been through.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<p>
I listen in group!

Your mom died of cancer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<p>
Your dad stuck you in boarding school

and remarried.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
And now there's a new baby

and no one pays attention to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<p>
But it's not his fault

you're drinking in rehab.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<p>
I was sober for most of last year

and he just waited for me to slip up

so he could ship me here

so I wouldn't embarrass him

and ruin his new perfect family--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<p>
Hey, if you don't wanna be here,

the gate code is one, two,

three, four, five, six.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
You could sneak out the upstairs window

after midnight bed check

by tying your sheets into a rope

and nobody would notice

you're gone until wake-up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<p>
But... is that what you really want?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<p>
[door closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<p>
[studio audience laughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<p>
Holy sheet!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<p>
I've heard of being at the end

of my rope...

but this is ridiculous!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<p>
Why would Sabrina run away like that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<p>
Because I had to break it to her that you

weren't going to be her new mommy,

international supermodel Cindy Crawfish!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
When I was flying to Paris

for Paris Fashion Week

and my private plane crashed

into your backyard,

the one thing I never expected

was to find someone so special.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
-Oh.

-[both chuckle]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
[audience] Aw!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
-Cut! That's a five, everyone!

-[bell ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<p>
So, look, you're doing everything great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
I'm loving your instincts, it's dead on,

couldn't be better, perfect.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
The one problem is the kiss got an "aw."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<p>
It's supposed to get an "Ooh!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
-Right?

-I'm nervous, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<p>
This is my first on-camera kiss,

and it's with Cindy Crawfish.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<p>
You know how many guys would kill

to be in your shoes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
What do I gotta do?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
Kiss you on the lips myself

to show you what a real kiss looks like?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
-[kisses]

-Ha-ha-ha!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
-No. I'll handle it.

-Well, I sure as hell hope so.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
[gulps] Mm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
-Hey, what's in this orange juice?

-Just a little extra punch.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<p>
Oh. No, no, I don't--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<p>
Trust me. It'll loosen you up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
The one thing I never expected...

was to find someone so special.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
-[Cindy] Hmm!

-[audience] Ooh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<p>
-[Herb] Love it! Cut and scene!

-[bell ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<p>
Hey, no way, the party's just beginning.

Let's do one more take!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
-You up for more acting, Cindy?

-[audience whooping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<p>
Well, if it's for the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
Hey, Sharona,

how 'bout some more of that OJ?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
-[Jameson grunting] Whoa! Ow.

-Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<p>
[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<p>
Holy sheet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
I've heard of being at the end of my rope,

but this...

is very serious!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
-[exhales]

-Jameson!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<p>
Don't cut the string that connects you

to the kite that is you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
-[scoffs] What?

-I don't know!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<p>
I was just trying to come up

with one of those dumb rehab sayings!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
McCaitlyn told me Dathan

was thinking of breaking up with me

because I got fat junior year.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<p>
So, I need to go show him

that I'm back to being hot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<p>
Then break up with him

for being a shallow buck foy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
You don't need to do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
Oh, what does it matter?

We both know this place is bullshit!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
So, why do you care what I do?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
Because I'm the idiot

who helped you escape.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
So, if you OD tonight,

then I'm the one who'll have to lie

to everyone about what happened.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
Well, I'm going.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
You can come with me if you want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
[sighs] God damn it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
[party music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<p>
[Jameson chuckles] Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
This is your boyfriend's house?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
-You can't go in there.

-I'll be fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<p>
I'll just find Dathan,

crush him with my thigh gap,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<p>
-and then we can go.

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
Dathan? Where are you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<p>
It's me, Jameson H.!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<p>
[people laughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<p>
[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<p>
[panting continues]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<p>
-[knocking on door]

-[boy] Hey, who's in there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
-Um...

-Is someone having sex in there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
I think there are people

having sex in there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
Hey, it was just the nerd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
Definitely no one having sex in here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
-[thuds]

-[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
Um. Oh. Mm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<p>
You're BoJack from Spanish 1, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<p>
-Uh, yeah. I mean, <i>sí!</i>

-[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
Okay. <i>"Sí"</i> ya around. [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
Ah, yeah, bye, Katie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
-Hey! You want a beer, Horseman?

-Oh, no, thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<p>
I mean, drinking's cool,

it's just that we're underage,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<p>
-and, you know, the law--

-I'm lifting 178 right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<p>
-[keg clangs]

-[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<p>
You know what? I'll have one beer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<p>
[pops]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
Okay, who am I? Who am I?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
-"I'm Eric from chemistry class!"

-[laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<p>
That's so Eric! [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
He is so in chemistry class!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
Speaking of losers, there's Josh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
Look, he's wearing K-Mart shoes

because his family's poor!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<p>
[laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<p>
Katie's not laughing because she always

thinks she's better than everyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
Hey, remember last year

when one of Katie's boobs

grew bigger than the other?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<p>
[groans] "Look at me, I'm Katie!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
[laughter continues]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
[Katie sobs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<p>
-Hey, you want some?

-Oh, yeah. Bartender, one more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
-[Jameson screaming]

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
-What's wrong?

-Dathan's sucking McCaitlyn's face!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
Oh, my God. Jameson.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<p>
Okay. It is not what it looks like,

I swear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<p>
You're still doing it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<p>
-I tried to make it easy on you, Jameson.

-[both moaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<p>
I told you things weren't going great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
Oh, Dathan, touch my boob.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<p>
Do not touch her boob!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<p>
Jameson, it's not my fault you're a mess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<p>
I mean, how many times

have you been to rehab?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<p>
Yeah, Jameson.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
[cries]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
[Dathan and McCaitlyn moaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<p>
[crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<p>
Look, it's okay.

You were gonna break up with him anyway.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<p>
-And your friend sucks.

-No, they're right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<p>
I'm a mess. And no one cares.

God damn it! I might as well drink.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<p>
-No. You don't need a drink.

-[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<p>
You need to get back to bed

and get some sleep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
You're right. I'm gonna go home

and sleep in my bed!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
And when my dad shows up

to ask why I'm not in rehab,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<p>
I'll be like, "Maybe <i>you </i>should go

to rehab for <i>your </i>addiction

to being a shitty dad, Dad!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<p>
Okay, Jameson,

you need to be responsible for yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
Now, I think that you should come back

to Pastiches with me, like you promised.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<p>
But if you wanna go to your dad's house,

all you have to do is steal Dathan's car,

and I heard Michele with one "L"

is about to jump naked into the pool,

so everyone's gonna be distracted,

which means this is the perfect time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:53" />

<p>
-But is that really what you want?

-[car engine revving]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<p>
-[Jameson] Bye, BoJack! Thanks!

-What the...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
God damn it! [grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<p>
Stupid... [mumbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<p>
-Oh.

-[touch tones beeping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<p>
[buzzing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
[sniffs] Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<p>
I need you to find the address

of some rich guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<p>
-BoJack?

-All I know for sure

is that he's the father of a girl

named Jameson, who's super annoying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<p>
I'm going to assume you have a good reason

to locate a girl

in the middle of the night,

but I can't help you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<p>
Fine! Be that way. Todd'll help me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<p>
-Can you patch me through to Todd?

-What? Call him yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
I don't know his number.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<p>
I only remember your number because it was

such a dumb number with all those fours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:34" />

<p>
Four, four, six, four...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<p>
My phone number

has a normal amount of fours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<p>
You are not gonna make me

self-conscious about--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<p>
And it ends with a three!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<p>
Talk about an anti-climax!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<p>
What kind of phone number

ends with a three?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<p>
Shut up about my phone number!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<p>
-Hold for Todd.

-[beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<p>
Todd's phone. Your one-stop shop

for all your Todd-related needs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<p>
Todd, I need you to track down

an address for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<p>
You're the world's best hacker, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<p>
Yeah, but not the kind of hacker

you're thinking of.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<p>
-Funny story--

-Okay, I gotta go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
-I'm at Coachella...

-Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<p>
Put my name on the wrong list,

suddenly I've entered

into a hacky sack competition!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
-Right.

-Prior to these events,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
-I've never hacked a sack in my life.

-Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
But the only other contender is

the Russian ringer they flew in special,

so I'm thinking,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
-"I've gotta win this for America!"

-Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
Long story short, the Russian had

a heart attack, so I won by default!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<p>
Uh, does that answer your question?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<p>
I don't remember my question,

but I'm gonna guess no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<p>
-Oh, hold on, I'm getting another call.

-[beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
Todd's phone!

Spare the Todd, spoil the child!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<p>
Did you get the black market

porcupine milk?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
Yeah, I'll bring it right over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<p>
Although, I'm not looking forward

to getting on a crowded bus

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<p>
-in Porcupine Town.

-[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<p>
-Hold on. Getting another call.

-[phone buzzes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
Hey, superstar!

How are things goin' on set?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
Well, the movie itself

is coming together beautifully,

but when I was on break

playing with my model helicopter,

it crashed into the studio water tower.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
-Oh, no!

-It gets worse!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
It flooded the set of former VJ Downtown

Julie Brown's new puppet show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<p>
-What?

-Completely ruining her vintage

goose-feather dress

she just bought

and disrupting the big finale

where her wooden puppet plays

Beethoven's Fifth on the bongos!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
Wait. You're telling me

your dumb drone downed a tower

and drowned Downtown Julie Brown's

dummy drumming dum-dum-dum-dum,

dousing her newly found,

goose-down, hand-me-down gown?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
-Yes, that is exactly right!

-I'll be right down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
-Todd, I gotta go.

-[beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<p>
-Hmm.

-[beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<p>
[muffled music playing over speakers]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<p>
-So, sounds like rehab's goin' well, huh?

-No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
[groaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
Hey, give me my phone back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<p>
I'm expecting some timely feedback

on an important dick pic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
Hey, do you know where Jameson lives?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<p>
Jameson H.? Or Jameson Q.?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
-Ugh, I don't know.

-Or Jameson M.?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<p>
Where is the nearest Jameson?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
-[door closes]

-[BoJack] Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<p>
Is that the car

from <i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
Yeah, my dad loves movie memorabilia.

And this car is his baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<p>
At least... No, it was his baby

before the new baby came.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<p>
Now the new baby's the baby,

which means the car is the new me,

so where does that leave me? Nowhere.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<p>
What are you talking about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<p>
He threw out all of my stuff

and turned my room into the baby's room.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<p>
He got rid of my softball trophies,

but he loves his stupid bat, naturally.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
-And his dumb stupid car!

-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>
-[crying]

-Parents are terrible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
But destroying things

isn't gonna change them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<p>
All you can change is you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<p>
Ugh. Fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<p>
If I'm gonna get lectured anyway,

I may as well go back to rehab.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<p>
-[glass shattering]

-[woman moans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
Dad, you there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<p>
Mom said since you didn't come home,

I should bring you your dinner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
And she said to tell you she hopes

you like cold, burnt pot roast

that was spit on.

</p>

-[woman moaning]

-Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<p>
Dad?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<p>
There it is, coax it out of my sheath.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<p>
[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
BoJack! What the devil!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
I-- I'll get right on that memo,

Mr. Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<p>
Okay, let me... Oops, oh. [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<p>
Okay, let me just...

Oh, you look so cute. Bye-bye. All right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
-What were you doing, Dad?

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<p>
It's fun to have you

at the office, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<p>
-You're really turning into a man.

-I am?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<p>
I think you're old enough now

to have a Jack and Coke.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<p>
Mm, nice and sweet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
Here's to our first drink

as father and son.

</p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
-Did I fall asleep? I feel sick.

-[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<p>
You went a little wild.

You made a mess on my carpet, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
I think your mother

would be very disappointed in you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
Maybe it's best if we both just forgot

about everything that happened tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
-Okay, buddy?

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<p>
You know what? Screw your dad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<p>
Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
Hey! That's the titular club

from <i>The First Wives Club.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<p>
You're just a kid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<p>
Why do you have to be responsible

for all the ways he screwed you up?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<p>
Yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<p>
[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
It's not my fault I was born!

He's the one who got my mom pregnant!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
Yeah, and I bet your mom sucked too!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<p>
[gasps] Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<p>
Chick ch'ka... Oh, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<p>

<p>
-[door opens]

-[baby crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
What the hell are you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
That's the giant window from <i>The Graduate!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
Daddy, I didn't wanna leave rehab,

but this scary old horse made me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
Hi, cutie! Mwah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<p>
Okay, I'm ready to go back to rehab now.

I'll go wait in the car!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
Jameson... [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<p>
-Listen--

-Are you drunk or high?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<p>
-What?

-Are you drunk or high right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
-No.

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<p>
I'm sorry she roped you into this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
You're not the first guy to help her

break out of that rehab.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
They always end up at my house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
And then they want me to keep quiet

to the press,

so they give me a souvenir

from one of their movies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:09" />

<p>
I could send you a swag bag

from Felicity Huffman's <i>Booty Academy,</i>

but you should probably wash the thong

before wearing it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
I don't know what to do with Jameson.

I've tried everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<p>
I thought she would change

after she had her baby, but...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
[baby cooing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
Change is hard.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
Takes a long time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<p>
Let me guess,

she wanted to see her boyfriend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<p>
Actually...

she told me she just wanted

to come here to see her baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<p>
[sighs] Wouldn't that be nice?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
Bye, Daddy! Love you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<p>
-Ugh. Sorry my dad's so embarrassing.

-Jesus Christ.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
You have no idea how lucky you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
I wish I had someone when I was your age

who cared about me enough

to put me in rehab.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
Yeah, maybe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
Well, anyway, thanks for keeping me

out of trouble tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<p>
Really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
It was a worth a try.

Ready to sneak back in?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
I'm getting too old to sneak in

and out of places.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
All right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<p>
[bell dinging]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<p>
-Checking in?

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<p>
I just snuck out and I'm coming back,

so, you know, put me down

for kitchen clean-up duty

or whatever the punishment is

for sneaking out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<p>
No, I don't think you've been here before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
Everyone who's been here before

is humble enough

to take a picture with me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<p>
[sighs] Yeah. Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<p>
Sign me up for six weeks. Starting now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
-And a picture?

-Sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<p>
-Cheese!
