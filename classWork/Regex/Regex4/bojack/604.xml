<p>
[Pickles]<i> Okay, guys,</i>

<i>that is my cat eye tutorial.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:09" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>It probably works better</i>

<i>if you're not a dog,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>but anyways, like and subscribe.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Oh, and RIP Nelson Mandela</i>

<i>and Paul Walker.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<p>
{\an8}-[icon pops]

<i>-Love you, sassy boys!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>I just don't feel like</i>

<i>doing a makeup tutorial today.</i>

</p>

<p>
{\an8}[Franco] <i>Demi!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>I really thought me and Buzzy</i>

<i>were built to last,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>like Brad and Angelina,</i>

<i>or Gwyneth and Coldplay Man,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>or America and its current love affair</i>

<i>with Rebel Wilson.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
{\an8}[sighs] <i>I'm sorry, I shouldn't be talking</i>

<i>about my personal life.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>I just feel so alone.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<p>
{\an8}-[icon pops]

<i>-Aw! Thank you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
<i>Hey, Pickle Pack!</i>

<i>Gettin' ready for another job interview.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
<i>I think I'm just gonna lie</i>

<i>about having experience. Right?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
<i>I got the job! I'm a systems analyst?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
<i>I got fired my first day</i>

<i>as a systems analyst,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<p>
<i>but then I got a job</i>

<i>as an air traffic controller!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<p>
<i>I got fired my first day</i>

<i>as an air traffic controller.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<p>
<i>But then I got a job as a waitress!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<p>
<i>-So, I've been seeing someone.</i>

-[icon pops]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<p>
<i>He's a yellow lab,</i>

<i>and he's so handsome and friendly.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<p>
[barks and licks]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
<i>-Mister asked me to move in with him!</i>

-[icons pop]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>-Hi, Mister!</i>

<i>-Oh, are you taking a video? </i>[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Thank you, queefburglar69,</i>

<i>for that lovely cartoon heart!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Get a load of this cool house,</i>

<i>Pickle Pack! Lights, off. Lights, on!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<p>
{\an8}-[giggles]

<i>-Thank you, Robot House!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<p>
<i>Check this out. The Thunder Room.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<p>
<i>A place to wait out thunderstorms</i>

<i>and Fourth of July celebrations!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<p>
<i>Thunder door, close!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<p>
[automated voice] <i>Closing. </i>[clunks] 

<i>Thunder Room secure.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<p>
<i>Cute!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<p>
<i>He got down on one knee and everything!</i>

<i>He was so nervous before he asked!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:51" />

<p>
<i>-Of course I said yes!</i>

-[icons pop]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:53" />

<p>
<i>-I think Mister is still in shock!</i>

<i>-Engaged! That's what we are now!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:58" />

<p>
<i>Ring filter!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<p>
<i>So, I guess I liked the play.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>I was just surprised at how different</i>

<i>it was from the movie.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:05" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>I kept waiting for the baseball part.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>And so many dysfunctional relationships!</i>

<i>All the cheating and lying!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:11" />

<p>
{\an8}[sighs] <i>I'm sure glad we're not like that,</i>

<i>right, Mister?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:14" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Um, Pickles, would you mind</i>

<i>turning off the livestream?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:18" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>There's something I need</i>

<i>to discuss with you. Privately.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<p>
<i>Ooh, I hope it's something good!</i>

[exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
Hi, I'm here to see BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<p>
You're... [sucks teeth]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
...too late.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
{\an8}-What?

-He's... [sucks teeth]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<p>
{\an8}...gone...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
{\an8}-No!

-...to a party for the night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<p>
{\an8}Here's the address.

Sorry for all the wincing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
{\an8}I put too many jalapeños

on my... [sucks teeth]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
{\an8}...sandwich.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
{\an8}A party? With alcohol?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<p>
{\an8}No, a lame party, without alcohol.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
{\an8}Don't worry. We sent him

with a trained sober companion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
He'll keep him out of trouble.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
This is Eduardo.

He's here to keep me out of trouble.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
[chuckles] Say, aren't you

one of those fainting goats?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<p>
[laughs] Only if I panic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
So, what makes you panic?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
Nothing. The whole point is

he doesn't panic. Sober companion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
{\an8}You know what makes me panic?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<p>
{\an8}Most of the time

I'm an ocean-levels-rising guy,

but sometimes I like to dwell

on the fact that

there will always be invisible walls

between myself and those who claim

to know me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<p>
[chuckles] That sure is nerve-racking,

but the only thing that makes me panic

is the thought

that I might someday drink again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<p>
-A toast to that never happening!

-[whimpers and thuds]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<p>
{\an8}Very helpful. Thank you, Eduardo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
Oh, I'm just Greg, a guy Mr. Peanutbutter 

met at a gas station once.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<p>
I honestly don't even know

why I got invited to this party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<p>
[Ruthie crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<p>
You know, I got a few TV ideas myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
[chuckles] Franco, nobody wants to hear

your time-travelling orthodontist pitch!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<p>
Demi, you are lighting a long fuse

on a short stick of dynamite.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<p>
Oh, whoop. And a big one at that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
{\an8}[inhales, exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
-Diane! Didn't think I'd see you here!

-[screams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
{\an8}Could you go tell BoJack to come out

so I can talk to him?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
{\an8}What? I don't have time

for your classic Diane wackiness.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
{\an8}We gotta get these to the balloon room!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
-[coos]

-[screams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<p>
-Hey.

-Hey, look who's back in town!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<p>
-[groans]

-Wow! Baby! Cute!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<p>
-[giggling]

-She's crawling all over the place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<p>
I wasn't gonna bring her out,

but another nanny quit on me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<p>
{\an8}Carlotta quit, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
{\an8}I assume she resigned in disgrace

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<p>
{\an8}for not making good airplane noises

when she feeds Ruthie?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<p>
No, she said she felt

she was being watched all day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
Impossible! I'm there around the clock,

observing her every move.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
-If she was being watched, I'd know!

-Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<p>
{\an8}Uh, where do these balloons go?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
Hello, Pickles' best friend Ilana.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<p>
Pickles' other friend Ilana.

Didn't think I'd see you here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
{\an8}And then of course, there's always

the looming fear

my spleen could up and re-twist itself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
{\an8}How are we back in a conversation?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<p>
{\an8}It's like I'm trying to canoe out to sea,

but the current keeps washing me back

to the same shallow backwater.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
-Hey, there you are.

-Thank God, I'm so glad you're here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
-Never leave my side.

-I have to tell you--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<p>
-Okay, everybody get to your places!

-What's happening?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter's and Pickles'

surprise wedding!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<p>
Surprise wedding?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
The wedding planning

was stressing Mr. Peanutbutter out,

and Pickles loves big romantic surprises.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<p>
And I'm not doing much

except for sitting at home

watching Princess Carolyn's

terrible nannies,

so naturally, I thought,

"Ooh! Surprise wedding!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
-Where are they now?

-I got them two tickets

to <i>Angels in the Outfield.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
-The movie?

-The play. It's like six hours long.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<p>
Do you mean <i>Angels in America?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<p>
Whatever it is,

after that feel-good comedy,

they'll be in a great mood for a wedding!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
Wow. Okay...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
Look, I cannot be here.

Just... I'm moving.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<p>
Great, your apartment's a dump.

Where are you moving to?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
Uh, not Echo Park. I'll never see you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<p>
-Chicago.

-Chicago? <i>Chicago</i> Chicago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<p>
Ooh, they just pulled into the driveway!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
-Shit! Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

-Why Chicago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
Everybody hide and stay quiet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<p>
[slapping and groaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<p>
Remember, as soon as the lights go on,

just jump up and yell, "Surprise!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
-Lights, off!

-[lights beep]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<p>
Um, Pickles? Would you mind

turning off the livestream?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
There's something I need

to discuss with you. Privately.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<p>
Ooh, I hope it's something good!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<p>
It's not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<p>
-Lights--

-Wait!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<p>
Before Robot House assaults us

with the harsh, unforgiving glare

of our energy-efficient bulbs,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
I need to tell you this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<p>
But it's so dark in here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<p>
What I'm about to confess is so shameful,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<p>
I can only admit it

in the cover of shadow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
Don't be silly. Lights, on!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<p>
-I cheated on you!

-[man] Surp--!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
-[man shushes]

-Did someone just say something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
Don't change the subject!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<p>
-[voice breaking] You cheated on me?

-I am so sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<p>
-How could you do this?

-It was the worst mistake of my life!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<p>
And I once played Twister

with Bryan Singer

at Kevin Spacey's party

for Andy Dick's early parole.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
-Ugh!

-I've been in the Thunder Room every night

for months trying to swallow my shame.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<p>
But I can't. And I've apparently been

so racked with guilt I left the door open.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<p>
-Thunder door, close.

-[automated voice] <i>Closing. </i>[clunks]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
<i>Thunder Room secure.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<p>
[muffled voice] Help! Please!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<p>
Just because you feel guilty,

that doesn't make it okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<p>
Are you the time I went to see

Lady Gaga in concert

and she didn't sing "Paparazzi"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:29" />

<p>
Because I am hurt,

and I am confused, and I am angry,

and nobody told me there was going to be

an encore, so I just went home and...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<p>
-[groans]

-Why am I even talking to you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<p>
-I need my best friend. I'm calling Ilana!

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
But, honestly,

can Ilana even relate to me anymore?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
Since she got that

new Sunday-to-Thursday job

she's turned into a real

see-you-next-Friday.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
I never thought I'd say this,

but sometimes I feel like I prefer

my other friend Ilana.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
Sometimes it's just easier to talk

to a person who has nothing else going on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<p>
-What?

-Please don't tell the Ilanas about this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
I'm gonna tell everybody about this.

I'm a Gemini.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
No! Think of my family!

They need me to be strong right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<p>
Poor Captain Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
He recently confided to me

he feels trapped in a loveless marriage

with Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
-[laughs awkwardly]

-Well, can you blame her?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<p>
Excuse me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<p>
Every time I get trapped

in a conversation with Captain,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
I think, "If I was married to this guy,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
I would gnaw my own hand off

just to get the ring off my body."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<p>
At least no one in my family

has anger issues.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<p>
My father has come so far

with his anger management classes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
I'm sorry, but your father is a hothead

with a little-pug complex.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
-Everyone makes excuses for his outbursts.

-[snarling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<p>
"I don't know what's gotten into Franco.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
-He's not usually like that."

-[shushes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
-Trust me. He's like that.

-How dare you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<p>
And the way your mother provokes him!

I think they get off on it,

and they're making us unwilling

participants in their kinky foreplay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
Ew! Those are my parents!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<p>
-And don't even get me started on Greg.

-[shushes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<p>
That guy that I met once

at that gas station!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<p>
-Why are you bringing him up?

-I don't know, but he sucks, too!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
-Oh.

-There, I got it off my chest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<p>
I know who I need right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
No, Pickles. Please don't TweedFeed this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
I understand your Pickle Pack

is part of how you process pain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
Wrong, Mr. Mister.

The Pack isn't part of anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
They are everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<p>
When I stabbed myself in the eye

with a boba straw,

they all sent me photos

of themselves wearing eyepatches.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<p>
And when my Grandma Piccolino died,

stickyvicki was the first person

to say, "LMAO. Sorry for your loss."

[knocks]

Hi. I know you are quite upset, but--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<p>
Are you not listening?

I told you to leave me alone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<p>
-Right, but--

-Oh! You want a makeup tutorial?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
Here's a makeup tutorial:

we are never making up!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<p>
-Wha--

-Door, slam!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
Okay. Here's how to look

like a crying, pugly freak!

<p>
-So, why Chicago?

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
What's the draw?

Is it the rampant gun violence?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
Or do you just like seeing improv actors

who aren't good enough for LA?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<p>
-Or is there a guy?

-Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
What's his name, your suitor?

Your gentleman caller?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
-Guy.

-Fine. What's your guy's name?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
No. Guy is the name of the guy

I'm not moving to Chicago for.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
What's the name of the guy

you are moving to Chicago for?

</p>

<p>
If you hadn't creeped out

every nanny I hire--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
I wouldn't have to monitor them so closely

</p>

<p>
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] Can do!

-I'll be right down!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<p>
Okay, Pickle Pack,

let's pick out an outfit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
What says, "I am going to survive this

because I am strong,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<p>
-but you should still feel very bad"?

-Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<p>
-Go, baby! Go to mama! Oh.

-[giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<p>
But what if we go for a walk, and he says

all the right things, and I forgive him?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<p>
I can't make it so easy for him, can I?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<p>
Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
That is an even better idea, MarciFartz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
Hey, Mister!

Cancel the park and come here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
What? Stay out of my shit, MarciFartz!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<p>
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] On my way, darling!

-Kitty up. [grunts]

<p>
-[Ruthie blows]

-[Princess Carolyn sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<p>
Bring me my favorite drink.

Exactly the way I like it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<p>
Then we'll talk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<p>
Of course, right away!

<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<p>
[BoJack grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<p>
[groans] Of course he'll make

my drink perfect.

<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
Because he's perfect!

</p>

<p>
I mean, look at him!

</p>

And... and... Look at him!

<p>
-[BoJack groaning]

-Um... Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
And him, as portrayed

in this boardwalk caricature drawing!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<p>
I didn't know he liked tennis

and skateboarding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<p>
What else has he been hiding from me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<p>
-[text pops]

-I need to pack!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<p>

<p>
-And...

-[gasps]

</p>

<p>
...I'm gonna try to get my room comped

in exchange for social media promotion!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
And then they'll say no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
And then I'll pay for the room

and drag them online.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<p>

There's no clear path to the exit.

You can wait it out, I'm doing the window.

It's not because of me

that you're moving to Chicago?

No. I need to go.

<p>
"Whipped cream

is the best thing in the world,"

immediately followed by,

and this is a direct quote,

<p>
"So, keep it as far away

from me as possible!"

Using that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:52" />

<p>
But they're a big deal, the chips.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<p>
Sure, they brainwash you into thinking

they're more important than they are,

but when I got my two-month chip...

That's great!

I still wanna marry you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<p>
I promise.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<p>
Then I guess we could put it behind us

if it just happened the one time.

</p>

<p>
It did! One time! One unit of cheating.

-But the spirit of it was once.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
Well, at least you told me right away.

</p>

<p>
-It happened a few months ago.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
-But I'm being honest with you now!

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
-At least it wasn't with someone I know.

-It was Diane.

<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<p>
That's so much worse!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
You are a bad dog!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
-No. No. No!

-[shrieks]

</p>

<p>
[crying continues]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
Come on, Eduardo. Hold it together.

You're not just a fainting goat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
You're a trained sober companion.

Just do what the sign says.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
No! [thuds]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

[whirring]

</p>

<p>
-Vacuum, stop.

-[automated voice] <i>Stopping.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
Coin sorter, sort. [tinkling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<p>
Oh, Coin Sorter,

I'd love to toss my problems in a tray

and say, "Here, sort these out."

I know it doesn't work that way,

but if only this smart house

could give some advice to this stupid dog.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
-[BoJack imitates robot] Go to her.

-Coin Sorter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
Go to Pickles. Go now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
I don't know, Coin Sorter.

I've already screwed everything up so bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
I should sit here

and wait for her to come to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<p>
No. You go to her. Leave this room.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
-Okay.

-[imitates robot] But don't talk so much!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
-What?

-It is I, the robot, uh, thermostat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<p>
Thermostat, I should have known.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
I can always count on you

to cool things down

when they get too heated.

You were saying?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
Sometimes you try to fix problems

or make them go away,

which comes off as dismissive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
If you want to solve this, listen.

Really hear her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
Beep-boop. Seventy-two degrees.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<p>
[both sigh, grunt]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
[normal voice] Is this mess

why you're moving to Chicago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
[normal voice] I told you,

I'm moving for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
I get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<p>
-Are you gonna be okay?

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<p>
-I mean... I don't know.

-You seem okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<p>
But the reason I had to tell you

I was leaving,

the reason I came

to my ex-husband's house,

was because I need to know

that you're gonna be okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
I need to hear you say it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<p>
I can't leave if I don't know

you're going to be okay, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
-I'll be okay.

-Promise?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<p>
Because if something happens,

and I'm in Chicago--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
That's not a friendship,

that's a hostage situation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
Go to Chicago. I'll be fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
Thank you.

</p>

<p>
Ruthie! [groans]

<p>
-[both grunting]

-[balloons popping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
-There you are!

-[giggling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<p>
Let's get you away

from these delightful choking hazards!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
You know, Todd, you have a knack for this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<p>
Would you wanna be her nanny?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<p>
I do know her routine

and all of her favorite foods

and how to do funny voices

for bedtime stories,

unlike Carlotta who does voices

like Cameron Diaz

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<p>
"did a voice" for the <i>Shrek </i>movies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>

-So, that's a yes then?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
[music playing over earbuds]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
I don't want to be mad at you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<p>
It sucks that I have to be mad at you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<p>
This should be

the happiest time of my life,

but now because you did something stupid,

I have to feel bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<p>
That's not fair.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<p>
And I still love you and...

[sighs] I still wanna marry you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<p>
But you can't do things

that hurt me like that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
It's not okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
And if we just go back

to the way things were before

and pretend nothing happened,

I'm gonna feel stupid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<p>
We can't just go back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<p>
How can we make this right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
Don't just stand there!

I'm talking to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<p>
I'm sorry. I want us to stay together.

I want you to trust me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<p>
I wanna make us even somehow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<p>
Even? The only logical way to be even

would be if I got to sleep

with somebody else.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
Okay. If that's what needs to happen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
-Really?

-Yeah, we just have to think who--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
Buzzy. My high school boyfriend, Buzzy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
Very quick with that name, but okay. Fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<p>
No, you don't even know him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<p>
Knowing is what hurts the most.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
What if I sleep with Buzzy <i>and </i>Tyler

from Soul Cycle?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<p>
-Two people?

-Well, maybe we can keep brainstorming.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<p>
If we put our heads together,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<p>
I know we'll find the perfect guy

for you to cheat on me with

that makes it totally even,

so things can go back to normal

and we can get married.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<p>
-Thank you.

-[doorbell rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
-Hey, guys.

-Diane?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<p>
I'm just here to randomly apologize

for that time we cheated on Pickles twice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<p>
It was a big mistake, and it was my fault,

and it will never happen again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<p>
Also, I think I left my wallet here

when I came to your party

a year and a half ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<p>
If you find it, probably under the bed

in the master suite,

could you mail it to me?

I live in Chicago now. Thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:37" />

<p>
This is Eduardo. Don't mind him.

He's just keeping me sober.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:40" />

<p>
Found the baby, had a blast, gotta go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:42" />

<p>
-And here's your boba.

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:46" />

<p>
-Odd.

-[phone buzzing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:47" />

<p>
-Oh, my parents are calling.

-Fun! Put 'em on speaker!
