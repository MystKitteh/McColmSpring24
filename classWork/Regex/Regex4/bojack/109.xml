So... should we talk about

</p>

<p>
No, I don't think

we need to talk about that.

</p>

<p>
Yeah, you're right.

What's to talk about, right?

We're f-friends, right?

<p>
- Oh, yeah, totally.

- Yeah, friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
And I think it's important

that we stay friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
Yeah, I agree.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

And be friends

with each other.

you're getting married.

<p>
That's right.

Next summer.

<p>
Nantucket is great

in the summer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
Not like L.A.,

which is so hot and dry.

Mr. Peanutbutter,

you know I love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<p>
And you know I am really excited

about getting married,

but right now I'm working,

and I have a lot of thoughts

in my head,

and I can't really think

about our wedding

or the future

or me being married to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<p>
Okay.

What's going on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<p>
Talk to me like

I'm Michelle Pfeiffer

in the Coolio video.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

</p>

<p>

<p>
It's just that this wedding

is kind of

starting to feel like

a lot.

<p>
Honey, relax.

Getting married is easy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

I've already done it twice.

<p>
It's fine.

I'm sorry.

I just got an amazing idea.

<p>
Sure, you'll act

all friendly,

gain his trust,

chauffer him around

on his little errands

to the groomer and whatnot,

but all the while,

you'll be studying him,

scouring out his weaknesses,

biding your time

till we're ready to strike.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<p>
And once you zero in

on his Achilles' heel,

we will take... him... down.

<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
[warbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:29" />

<p>
Oh, man. Oh, man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
- Keep it cool, Todd.

- Hey, pal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
If you're making

small talk up there,

how about sending

a little my way?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
Um... can you believe

this weather we're having?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<p>
No, I cannot believe

this weather we're having!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
Hey, weren't you supposed

to be here

like a half hour ago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<p>
Yeah, I've just been

sitting in my car.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<p>
[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
Listen, I was looking

over my notes,

and I think I have enough

to go write the book,

so...

I'm just going to do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
You don't want

to interview me anymore?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
But don't you want to know

what my Rosebud is?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
You told me repeatedly

it was the nudie magazine

your uncle showed you

with the three-nippled woman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
- Who was she?

- I got it all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
Oh, okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<p>
Well, I'll see you

around though, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
Yeah.

I, um--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
Why did you have to make

things weird, BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<p>
[car door opens, closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
I made things weird?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<p>
[Mr. Peanutbutter]<i> </i>So if you see anything

you know we need,

like this biscuit warmer,

you just run the laser

over the barcode,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<p>
- and kablamsky!

- [beep]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
It goes in the registry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
And that way, everybody knows

what I want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
- And I know what I want.

- Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
Which is what everyone wants.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
And it's really clear,

and nobody's confused

about anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<p>
Am I crazy,

or are you not into this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
No, I am. It's just--

[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<p>
The big wedding in Nantucket,

all these presents--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<p>
I'm so overwhelmed,

I can barely consider

whether I want or need

a biscuit warmer,

which I think is how people

end up with biscuit warmers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<p>
Hey.

Hey, hey, hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<p>
Close your eyes.

Come on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<p>
Okay, picture

our lives together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
It's a cold Sunday morning

a bunch of years from now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
Maybe robots have taken over,

maybe they haven't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
I don't know.

It's the future.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<p>
This story isn't about that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<p>
The important thing is

it's Sunday morning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
I brought you the paper,

fetched your slippers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
You come into the kitchen--

Can you smell biscuits?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:16" />

<p>
- Yes.

- So can I.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
- Are they warm?

- Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<p>
Well, that's all

a biscuit warmer's for.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<p>
Look, if marriage

stresses you out,

we don't have to get married.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
It's not the marriage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
It's the wedding

and the year of build-up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<p>
So forget all that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
I've done

the whole big wedding thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<p>
I don't need to do it again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
Let's do something

small and casual

right here in town

next month.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
Honestly,

that would be amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<p>
But we'd have to cancel

the doves,

and we wouldn't be able

to send out

those fancy invitations

you liked.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
Those doves were being

jerks anyway.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
And invitations--

They're just a scam

made up by the Post Office

to keep tabs on us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<p>
Post Office.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<p>
- [growls]

- Settle down, boy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
[Todd] And then we talked about

his favorite Smash Mouth CDs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
[crunching]

And-- Oh, oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
And then that led to a whole

conversations about sticks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<p>
Oh, and let me tell you,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter has got some

serious opinions about sticks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<p>
Why are you telling me this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
What? You said

you wanted every detail.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<p>
Did I mention

he got a new bandana?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
Give me something

I can use

to make them call off

their wedding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<p>
Oh, yeah.

Did I not tell you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
They called off their wedding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<p>
What? Thank God!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<p>
Oh, the universe makes sense.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
They decided against

a big destination wedding,

so they're doing it here

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
- sometime next month.

- What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<p>
I guess saying

they called it off

is probably not right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
[ominous music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
Hey, what's this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<p>
Oh, yes,

I got jury duty,

but I can't worry

about that right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<p>
That is a problem for

Friday BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
Now think, Todd.

Gotta have something I can use

sloshing around in that

pot-infused Jell-O shot

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
- you call a brain.

- Let's see.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter likes having

his tummy scratched,

and Diane's family

is from Vietnam,

which is where Vietnamese food

comes from,

and since that goes

in your tummy--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<p>
Okay, stop thinking.

Just give me raw data.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
What's happening this week?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<p>
Well, the circus

is in town.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<p>
Congress is going to vote

on the new Education Bill--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<p>
With Mr. Peanutbutter!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
What's happening

with Mr. Peanutbutter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<p>
Well, I'm taking

Diane and him

to the bank on Thursday.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
I can use that.

I can actually use that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
I don't know if I'm up

for staging

a bank robbery, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<p>
Oh, come on, character

actress Margo Martindale.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<p>
They say that there are

no good parts

for women over 50.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
I want to stick an AK-47

in your hand

and prove them wrong.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<p>
I do tire of the limitations

of stage, film,

and television.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
You might as well perform

in a cage, am I right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
This is guerilla theater--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
No stage, no script, no net.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
It's the kind of work

we talked about

doing that night

in the desert.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
Don't tell me we left

those dreams in the sweat lodge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<p>
- Hell, I'll do it.

- [dishes clatter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<p>
And that little boy

never found his mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<p>
Hey, guys.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<p>
BoJack Horseman?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<p>
Oh. Hi.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<p>
What a weird coincidence.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
I did not know

you would be here today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
How are... things?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<p>
Things are good.

You?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
Things good with you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<p>
Hands behind your head,

everybody.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
Nobody moves,

nobody gets shot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
- [gasps]

- What an unfortunate surprise.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<p>
Well, well,

isn't that a pretty ring?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<p>
- [gasps]

- [coughs] This one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<p>
Well, well,

isn't that a pretty ring?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<p>
I'll take it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<p>
But it's

my engagement ring.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
Give it to her, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<p>
- It's just a ring.

- Just a ring?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<p>
That ring is a symbol

of your love.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<p>
If you don't care

about the ring,

it really makes me wonder

if you care about

the woman wearing it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
That terrifying bank robber

is making

some very cogent points.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<p>
No, Mr. Peanutbutter's right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
If the ring is

just a symbol for love,

why would I need a symbol

when I have the real thing

right here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<p>
Yeah, we don't need rings,

we have each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
Hey, why are we even waiting

a month to get married?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<p>
If anything, this bank robbery

is reminding me

that life is short.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<p>
We should get married

even sooner!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<p>
[softly]

No...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<p>
What do you mean sooner?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<p>
Why not this weekend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
We could get married Saturday.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<p>
Am I crazy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
[softly]

Yes. Don't do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<p>
- Oh, keep the damn thing.

- Aw.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
[applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<p>
Okay.

Saturday it is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
What the hell

just happened?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
Something truly beauti--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
Aah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<p>
- Oh.

- Get your hands off me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<p>
- [Taser crackles]

- Uh-oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<p>
[landing blows]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
[laughs]

Long story short,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<p>
Erica did have to lose

the foot,

but she gained a friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<p>
Sorry, kind of went off

on a tangent there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>
Diane and I

wanna thank you all

for coming to our

impromptu rehearsal dinner,

even though

we did not actually have time

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<p>
- to organize a rehearsal.

- Or a dinner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<p>
But there is an open bar...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
[cheers and applause]

which you are

all welcome to partake in

as soon as I finish

this toast,

which I will be doing right...

after one more quick anecdote.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
- [guests groan]

- It was winter in Prague,

and the consumption hung low

in the air.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
Well, the bank thing

was a dud.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<p>
Thanks a lot, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
Well, you win some,

you lose some.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
It's like Vincent always says--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<p>
- "Oopsy."

- Vincent?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<p>
Yeah,

Princess Carolyn's boyfriend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
We've hung out

a couple times.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
- What are you ta--

- That dude is funny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<p>
You know he's not

a person, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
Look, I don't want to get

in the middle

of your whole thing

with Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<p>
It's not about that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<p>
I just don't understand

why nobody else

seems to notice

that she is dating a man

who is clearly

three little boys

doing the thing

from <i>The Little Rascals.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<p>
Oh, that reminds me

of another funny story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<p>
[clinks glass]

If I could say a few words?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<p>
BoJack Horseman.

Take the mic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<p>
Spin us a yarn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
Since I am friends

with both of you

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<p>
- and have no ulterior motives...

- Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<p>
I would like to offer

my restaurant

as a venue for your wedding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />

<p>
Wow! Really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<p>
I don't know.

That's too generous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<p>
Hey, don't look a horse's gift

in the mouth, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

<p>
[laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<p>
I get it.

Like the song.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
That's not a song.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<p>
All right, everyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<p>
That's it for the toasts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<p>
Enjoy yourselves

and each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<p>
[dance music plays]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<p>
This is perfect.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<p>
Now that the wedding's

at my restaurant,

we have

the home field advantage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<p>
Perfect for sabotage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<p>
BoJack,

I need to thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<p>
You calling me to the bar

the other night

turned out to be

the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<p>
- I think I'm in love.

- Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<p>
This "person"

you're in love with--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<p>
Have you seen him

without his trench coat on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
I don't understand why

you can't be happy for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
He's a good boyfriend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<p>
I actually think

you and Vincent

would really hit it off

if you gave him a chance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
You should spend some

one-on-one time with him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
You mean one-on-three time?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<p>
Because

there are three of him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<p>
We get it.

You don't like him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
I'm actually not sure

you do get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<p>
- [unzips]

- I know what's been going on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
Ah!

I wasn't gonna pee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
I was just taking

my penis out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<p>
You've been driving me around,

but there was something else

happening the whole time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<p>
I see it now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:29" />

<p>
What are you

talking about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
You weren't just working

as my driver, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
You were becoming my friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<p>
Oh, yeah.

That was happening.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
Well, I could use a friend

right about now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<p>
There's something I really

gotta get off my chest,

and if it got out, it could

destroy the whole wedding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
No, I'm not great

with sensitive information.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<p>
I don't know if I'm ready

to get married again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<p>
Don't get me wrong.

I love Diane so much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<p>
I didn't have any doubts

until I realized

she had doubts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<p>
Then I figured

she's smarter than I am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<p>
Maybe she knows things

I don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<p>
You are kind of unloading

a lot of sensitive information here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<p>
Sure, I think I'm ready

to commit to Diane,

but I can't even commit

to my favorite type of stick.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<p>
Yes, today, it's short

and knobby, but tomorrow?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
Well, sure, Diane is short,

but I don't know about knobby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<p>
The last thing I want to do

is hurt Diane,

but I keep having this dream

where she's gone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<p>
There's no break-up,

no tragedy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
She's just gone, and my life

continues without her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<p>
And it terrifies me

to say this,

but in the dream I feel...

relief.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
Hey, thanks for listening

to all this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<p>
You're

a really good friend, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:32" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
Since you weren't able

to give me any useful intel,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<p>
I had to offer up

my restaurant,

but now, we're on my turf.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
Time for operation "I don't."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
Yeah, sounds good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
You know, with my knack

for coming up with plans

and your ability

to hear them

without contributing

more than three words

at a time,

we make a pretty good team,

don't we, Todd?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
- You said it.

- See?

[newsman] <i>Beloved character actress</i>

<i>Margo Martindale</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<p>
<i>is in police custody tonight</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<p>
<i>for her role in</i>

<i>a failed bank robbery.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<p>
Margo Martindale?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<p>
<i>But first,</i>

<i>pizza for breakfast?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<p>
<i>The answer might surprise you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
I know her, but how?

Wait.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<p>
She was

at the convenience store

the night I bought

that video game

and ruined my rock opera.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
<i>She's the one who asked me</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<p>
<i>to hand her that tape</i>

<i>from the 10¢ bin.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
[gasps] That means

Margo Martindale likes tapes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<p>
And a tape is something

you listen to,

but tape is also

a sticky thing

you can use to seal boxes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />

<p>
Boxes is

what cereal comes in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<p>
What does it all mean?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
Am I just grasping

at straws?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
Wait.

Straws-- That's it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<p>
Straws are used

to drink soda or water,

and plants need water.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<p>
And BoJack used Margo Martindale

as a plant

at the bank

and the convenience store,

which means--

Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<p>
BoJack hired Margo Martindale

to make me find

that video game

so he could kill

my rock opera!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<p>
Aw, dude.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<p>
- Rise and shine, Todd.

- I didn't sleep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
Well, we're down to the wire,

but we still got

one more day to figure out

how to stop this wedding,

and I can't afford to waste

one second, so let's get--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<p>
Oh, shit.

Forgot about jury duty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
Damn you, Tuesday BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<p>
- And so, you saw the defendant.

- Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
That man, the defendant--

You saw him?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
Come on, come on, come on.

Hurry up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
- That's correct.

- The defendant was seen by you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
Sweet Jesus.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<p>
Some of us have weddings

to ruin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<p>
No further questions,

Your Honor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<p>
I'm sorry. I misspoke.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<p>
A lot of further questions.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<p>
[murmuring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<p>
We did the right thing today,

BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<p>
But you know who

the real winner is?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<p>
- Justice.

- Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>

- Amazing!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<p>
This has been

the role of a lifetime.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
I think they're gonna

send me up to Lompoc,

and when I get there,

I'm gonna find

the meanest, hardest queen bitch

of the yard,

and I'm going to bite

her finger off.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<p>
[laughs] That'll show everyone

I'm crazy,

and you don't mess

with crazy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
Plus, free finger.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
Oh, here I am blabbering

on about my plans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
Did you ever stop

that wedding?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
It's actually happening

right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
I ran out of time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
I never understood why

it was so important to keep

those two apart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
I was just trying to be

a good friend

in my own

shitty, ass-backwards way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<p>
Diane deserves the best.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
She's smart

and kind and beautiful,

and it's gonna be

mostly synonyms from here on

if I keep going,

and I'm in love with her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
Tell her that, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
You don't need kooky schemes

or nutty capers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<p>
Just go to her

and speak from your heart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:09" />

<p>
Then find the biggest person

at the wedding

and bite his finger off!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
You're right, partly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
I've gotta tell her

how I feel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<p>
Okay, I'm gonna do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
Good luck with

your finger thing.

<p>
Todd, thank God you're here!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
Did I miss it?

Is it too late?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<p>
Dude. I'm done with this.

No. No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter's

been nice to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter

is nice to everybody.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<p>
That's what makes him

so stupid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<p>
No, I'm stupid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<p>
But even I know

that the only reason

you're doing this is because

you're in love with Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<p>
Yes, that's right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
And I'm here to finally

tell her how I feel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<p>
BoJack,

she knows how you feel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
How?

I barely just realized--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
Hey, man,

she made her choice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
Look around.

This day is not about you, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<p>
So maybe you should

just stop trying

to mess

with other people's lives.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
[Diane]<i> I never thought I wanted</i>

<i>to get married.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
It's so weird,

this idea of dedicating

yourself to something

for the rest of your life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
Like, how could you know,

right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
But then I realized it's okay

to not know everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
And some things take

a leap of faith.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter, I want

to take that leap with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
By the power vested in me

by one of those dumb websites,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
I now pronounce you married.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>

Hi.

So you're the quote-unquote

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
What have you got figured out

that I don't?

<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<p>
Um, adult stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
Yeah, I'm not seeing it.

<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
But that doesn't matter.

Not everything's about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<p>
And maybe I am

a little jealous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<p>
Not because I actually want to

date Princess Carolyn anymore,

but just because I don't like

the idea that I can't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<p>
I guess I just assumed

I always could.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<p>
But I made

a lot of bad decisions.

<p>
Not just with her.

With... [sighs]

with everyone, really.

</p>

Princess Carolyn was right.
