<title>A Little Uneven, Is All - BoJack Horseman</title>

<timestamp data-time="00:00:09" />

<line>
In my line of work,

I meet a lot of big names.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<line>
I'm talking the sexiest guys of the '90s:

Nick Nolte. Mickey Rourke...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
Literally, here we are in the '90s,

and these are the guys

we think are sexy, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<line>
And my daughter couldn't care less.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
But when I told her

I was meeting BoJack Horseman...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
Do me a favor. Make her day.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<line>
Me? I didn't ask for this gig.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
Angela Diaz,

head of the network, calls me,

working schmuck, Danny Bananas,

and says, "Danny, Herb Kazzaz is leavin',

and I want you to run <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<line>
So, here's me, thinking,

"What an opportunity

to write for the most finely-calibrated

ensemble cast on television!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<line>
It's like a bowling alley

with you people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<line>
Setting up pins and knocking them down.

I should be so lucky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
-Uh.

-I know it's no secret

that you and Herb had some friction,

and he left the show

under not-great circumstances.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<line>
Now I'm coming at this from a place of...

this is your house,

and I'm a guest, all right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
The magic of <i>Horsin' Around</i>

is not Herb Kazzaz or Danny Bananas.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<line>
I know why people buy the Big Mac.

I'm not here to change the recipe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<line>
You're the special sauce, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
Me? I just wanna be the bun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<line>
And not even the top or the bottom bun.

I'm fine being the middle bun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<line>
-You already told me this story.

-I did?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<line>
Yeah. Danny. Sharona. The buns.

We've been over it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<line>
-Well, did I tell you about Gina?

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>
-And Sarah Lynn?

-Multiple times. Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<line>
-What about the time I sneezed on Marisa?

-You've told me everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<line>
You told me about that dream

where you go to a dinner party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<line>
I even went down

that strange detour with you

about the three-nippled woman in

the nudie magazine your uncle showed you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<line>
-Who was she?

-I think we're done here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<line>
-What do you mean, done?

-Well, you've been here six months.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<line>
It's time to go home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<line>
[Shannon] Oh, sorry. Uh, not this way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:40" />

<line>
{\an8}My boss is gonna kill me

if I don't deliver these flowers

to his mistress.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:44" />

<line>
Well, we're filming

an episode of <i>Birthday Dad,</i>

and my boss is gonna kill me

if I let anyone through.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<line>
{\an8}Great, when they discover my remains

scattered in the bramble of Griffith Park,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:53" />

<line>
{\an8}my loved ones will take solace

knowing I died

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<line>
{\an8}so they could shoot an episode

of <i>Birthday Dad.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<line>
I'm sorry. It's a really good show!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:03" />

<line>
{\an8}I know I couldn't always be there for you,

birthday-wise, but I'd like to be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<line>
{\an8}I'd like to be your Birthday Dad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<line>
{\an8}You really don't get it, do you?

This is the real world, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
{\an8}And I'm a career gal.

I don't have time for birthdays.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<line>
{\an8}But what about the birthday spirit?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<line>
{\an8}Everyone knows there's no such thing.

This is the real world.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<line>
{\an8}Now, if you'll excuse me,

I need to drink my coffee.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<line>
{\an8}-Cut. Let's move on.

-[bell rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<line>
{\an8}Great take, Melodie. Chills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<line>
{\an8}Are we Glenn Close,

Jeff Goldblum, Kevin Kline,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<line>
{\an8}and all of the greatest Motown singles

collected on one...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<line>
{\an8}[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
{\an8}-[chuckles] "Big Chills."

-Hot herbal tea?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<line>
{\an8}-Yes, that would be-- Ooh!

-Ha!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<line>
{\an8}-Oops.

-[chuckles] Got me again, Audrey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<line>
{\an8}Donna, we're gonna need another scarf.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<line>
{\an8}Am I crazy, or has the crew turned on you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<line>
No, what they're turned onto

is hating me...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
{\an8}on account of I cheated on Pickles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<line>
{\an8}Ever since the story went viral,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
{\an8}the public has really mashed

the thumbs down on old Peanurino.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
{\an8}-Especially young women.

-Oh, no!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<line>
{\an8}"Especially young women"

is one of our show's eight target demos.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<line>
We gotta juice your Q!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
Right now, the only juice

I'm interested in is Pickles' juice

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<line>
{\an8}and making things kosher between us,

which is a task I relish.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
-So, you wanna have sex with me?

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
And your fianc√©

is gonna be in there watching, or...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
Oh, no. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<line>
This is not a fetish-based

cuckolding scenario.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<line>
He had sex with his ex, so to level

the playing field now, we have to boink,

so Mister and I can be even

and everything can go back to normal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
You understand?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<line>
Not really,

but I get to have sex with you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<line>
-Yeah.

-Correct.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<line>
Then, cool. I'm in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<line>
-But what about your reputation?

-I'm not too worried about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
I feel like people

generally want to like me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<line>
And if I just don't do anything,

eventually, the universe will realign

and the public will go back

to loving me again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<line>
-[grunts]

-Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
-Mm, thanks for making breakfast.

-Thanks for calling it breakfast.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
Not everyone appreciates

the subtle art of the crispy oatmeal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<line>
-Are you starting your memoir today?

-That was the plan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<line>
But I got these dishes now.

That'll take all morning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<line>
And once the morning's over,

basically the whole day is shot, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<line>
Better to start clean tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<line>
Look, I know it's hard

to start a new thing,

but the hardest part is starting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
You're right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<line>
Also, I'm a freelance cameraman

who pays child support,

so I'd encourage you to get an advance.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
Hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<line>
[indistinct chattering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<line>
Hey, uh, guys? Uh, excuse me, everyone?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<line>
I just wanted to raise

a non-alcoholic toast to Denise.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
-[laughter]

-Ha-ha!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
[man] Ow! My gluten intolerance!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
We've all been through so much together,

and it's never easy to say goodbye.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
-Remember when Doug left?

-[all] Hmm?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
-Or Jameson?

-[all muttering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<line>
Or sweet, sweet Bongo?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
-Sorry, who are we talking about?

-To Denise!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<line>
[all] Denise!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<line>
[man laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<line>
I didn't realize

we're the last of our original group.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
-God, we had some good times, huh?

-I mean, no, mostly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
-Yeah. But you're ready, right?

-Ready or not, here I go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<line>
Yeah, you're ready.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<line>
Have you given any thought

to what we discussed yesterday?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<line>
About you transitioning to a version

of yourself that is no longer here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<line>
I don't know.

Things are kinda working for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
Staying out of trouble,

got the fancy room,

finally perfected

my egg-white omelet order.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
The secret is egg yellows.

I might do another six weeks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
[chuckles] You've already re-upped

three times.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<line>
This place is for people in crisis.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<line>
In crisis of being too cool, maybe.

Right, Karmen?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<line>
-I-If I say yes, I can see my baby?

-Karmen, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<line>
You sold your baby to a den of leeches

to pay for crack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<line>
-The leeches have your baby now.

-Oh, yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<line>
Ah. Classic Karm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<line>
It's natural to be hesitant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<line>
When I first checked out of rehab,

I was terrified.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<line>
I knew a single drop of alcohol

would send me down a ruinous path.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<line>
-But I found my way.

-Found your way back to rehab.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<line>
-Ah, I'll miss our little comedy routines.

-"Our"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<line>
A lot of people leave this place,

and I think, "They're not gonna make it."

Like Denise, for example.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<line>
But you?

You've done the work, and you're ready.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<line>
You're a special case, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<line>
-I am?

-Of course you are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<line>
Huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<line>
[Sharona]<i> Oh, boy,</i>

<i>did he do a number on you.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
He was actually very nice.

You know, I want things to be easy on set.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<line>
And I think Danny

represents a fresh start.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<line>
-Is that why you got Herb fired?

-Hey, I'm not the one who--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<line>
I can't do your hair

if you're gonna move your head so much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<line>
There was nothing I could do about Herb.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<line>
If it wasn't for me,

they would've canceled the whole show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<line>
And then where would you go?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
Who's gonna hire

a hair-and-makeup lady with shaky hands?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
-My hands only shake when I don't drink.

-Be sure to put that on your r√©sum√©.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<line>
You're just bitter because I'm the only

person who can drink as much as you do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<line>
-[giggles]

-Ruthie!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<line>
-Here comes the airplane...

-[tires screech]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<line>
-[car crashes]

-Oh, a kerfuffle!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
[people clamoring]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
Hey! What's going on out there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<line>
An ice cream truck

crashed into the root beer factory!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<line>
Oh, sounds like a delicious disaster.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
-Five people are dead!

-Oh, no!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<line>
And there's worse to come,

unless somebody can slurp up

all that ice cream!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<line>
Oh, I'd love to help slurp,

but I just started a new nannying job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<line>
I don't care!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<line>
Hmm...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<line>
Wow, BoJack leaving rehab.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<line>
-Truly the end of an era.

-[crying]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<line>
Sobby Bobby.

Gonna miss your excessive crying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<line>
Can't believe it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
Last time I'm gonna stop

at this vending machine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<line>
What do you say, B-7?

One more hike down Funyun Canyon?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
[inhales] Whew.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<line>
Oh, wow. Hello, the public.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<line>
Didn't think I'd have to address this

so quickly, but I am not ashamed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<line>
-Yes, I, BoJack Horseman, went to rehab--

-Uh, keep it moving.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<line>
We wanna get a clean shot

for when Gen Z pop superstar/fashion

disrupter Joey Pogo shows up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<line>
-Joey Pogo?

-Yeah, he's checking in today.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<line>
-We heard he's gettin' the fancy room.

-Fancy room?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
He's gettin' the fancy room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<line>
-It's time to go home.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<line>
Ready or not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
I got the fancy room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
He's gettin' the fancy room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
You're a special case, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<line>
Stay cool, man. Have a good summer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
What does it all mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<line>
Sounds like they're kicking you out

to make room for Joey Pogo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<line>
Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<line>
Sounds like they're kicking you out

to make room for Joey Pogo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<line>
Oh, my God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<line>
I think they're kicking me out

to make room for Joey Pogo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<line>
I just feel like if I knew

the source of my addiction,

everything else would just click together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<line>
-Playtime's over.

-BoJack!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<line>
-What the hell? This is my time.

-Shut up, Brad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<line>
The source of your addiction

is wanting to impress your old babysitter

who stole beer from your parents' fridge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<line>
She's dead. You're free.

<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
No, that's not...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<line>
Oh. Oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
I thought you were checking out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<line>
-Oh, you would love that, wouldn't you?

-Yes. I've been very clear on that matter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
Well, check this out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<line>
BoHo go bye... BoHo go bye-bye for...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<line>
What is he doing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<line>
I think he's trying to get out a zinger.

We better let him finish.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<line>
You have to imagine that I just said it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<line>
It's only funny

if it feels extemporaneous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<line>
Don't waste your breath setting it up,

just say the thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<line>
-Why don't you start over?

-Check this out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<line>
BoHo go bye-bye for JoJo Pogo?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:16" />

<line>
That's a no-go, bro.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<line>
Worth it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<line>
[car horns blaring]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<line>
I'm sorry. Please, go around.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
I worked on it all night.

The thing that's gonna save your career.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
Ha!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<line>
-What is it?

-It's a meme! For posting online!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<line>
{\an8}Teacher gave you too much homework?

"Sad Dog!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
Your favorite sports outfit

lost the match? "Sad Dog!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<line>
People are gonna love it.

And that love will transfer to you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<line>
But I'm not a sad dog.

I'm a happy dog. Everyone knows that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<line>
-So, it needs some massaging.

-[phone rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<line>
Hold on, I gotta take this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:48" />

<line>
Conversation over? "Sad Dog!"

See how easy it is?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<line>
-[phone beeps]

-Pickles! How was your date with Carl?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<line>
I don't know, Mister.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<line>
The sex was good, like, really good,

but I didn't feel an emotional connection.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<line>
Don't beat yourself up about that.

You just met the guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<line>
But part of the betrayal

of you sleeping with Diane

is the fact that you share

an intimate history.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
If we're really trying to even things out,

I don't think Carl counts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<line>
Okay, well, then I guess you'll just have

to keep having sex with people

until you find someone with whom you have

an emotional connection.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
[sighs] That might be a lot of guys,

but if that's what it's gonna take

to save our marriage,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
I will keep riding the express train

to bone-town until that happens.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<line>
That's my girl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>
-Oh! Thank you.

-[phone ringing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<line>
-[beeps]

-Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
Hey, it's Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<line>
Oh, yes, I thought I heard

retired dads in the distance,

praising the '95 Chicago Bulls.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<line>
Maybe you could give me some advice.

I'm writing a new book,

but I shouldn't even get started

until I sell it to a publisher, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
-What is it?

-I'm still in the loose idea phase.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<line>
Half essay, half memoir.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
The working title is

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<line>

<i>The Places We Go: Part One.</i>

</line>

<line>
Wait, how is it part one if it's

definitive? I'm getting another call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<line>
-[phone beeps]

-Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
Hi, while you were blabbering on,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<line>
I had our lit assistant

take care of everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
A navel-gazey book of observations.

Sounds fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
-<i>No, I--</i>

-I sold it. You have six months.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<line>
Enjoy the process.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
Wha...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
What happened?

You're packing your things backwards.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<line>
What happened is you said I was special.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<line>
You gave a whole spiel

 just trying to get rid of me

to make room

for a high-profile new client.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>
I thought we'd made strides

on your jealousy issues.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<line>
And also, it's pronounced "shpeel."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
I'm not jealous! And I've definitely

seen it written out as "spiel."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<line>
I think it's spelled "spiel,"

but it's pronounced "shpeel."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<line>
Not now, Joey Pogo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<line>
I'm sorry, am I interrupting?

I was told I was in the fancy room?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<line>
We're moving some things around.

Uh, maybe you could come back tomorrow?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<line>
Oh, tomorrow is jammed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<line>
I'm shootin' a video

for my new single, "Lace Up,"

which is spon-con

for my sneaker collab with Mister Pibb.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<line>
-Could we just do it now, real quick?

-You wanna do rehab real quick?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<line>
Life is precious. God is religious,

or merely the idea of human connection.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
Don't do drugs. Say you're sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<line>
Powerful stuff.

Feels like I just got a new lease on life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<line>
Stay cool, bro. Don't ever change.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
That's the problem. When you say it

in here, it all sounds easy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<line>
But I know that out there,

it's hard and confusing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<line>
-And it's just-- I-I don't...

-But you're not alone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<line>
You have a wonderful support system.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<line>
Think of all your amazing friends

just waiting to love you as you love them.

Todd's phone. What if Todd was one of us?

<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<line>
Um, okay. Is Todd there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

You're probably wondering about Georgette,

<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<line>
-the newest member of Team Chavez.

-Nope.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<line>
Since I've started

taking care of Ruthie full-time,

that hasn't given me a lot of time

for regular Todd business,

and stuff's been falling

through the cracks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<line>
So, you hired an assistant?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<line>
Well, yes, but assistants

are like <i>Deadpool</i> movies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<line>
I couldn't just stop at one,

even though I probably should have.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<line>
Now I have 12.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<line>
You hired 12 assistants? To assist <i>you?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<line>
Yep, I've got Bella

trying out new goofy dances,

</line>

Pedro's monitoring

all the Five Guys franchises

-What is "All About That Ace?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<line>
My asexual dating app.

I think I might be the only one on it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:32" />

<line>
-[Ruthie giggles]

-But another ace could join any day now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<line>
And when that happens, two of a kind.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<line>
Well, I guess that makes about

as much sense as the rest of it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<line>
Listen, um, I might be getting out

of rehab soon...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<line>
BoJack, that's fantastic!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<line>
...and I wanted to talk to you

because I, uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<line>
...can't do this by myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
Hey, I got you, buddy.

You just wait one jiffy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
-Hi.

-Ah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<line>
I'm Casey, the assistant.

Todd hired me to be your friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<line>
Okay, that's, uh, you know...

I think I'm good. Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
He said I would be perfect for you

because you could be mean to me

and you wouldn't feel bad,

because you're paying me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<line>
Okay, well, that's kind of thoughtful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<line>
I'm a very good assistant, and I can be

very discreet, whatever you need.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<line>
Marc Cherry used to dress me

in the outfit Natalie Wood drowned in

and scream at me for hours on end.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
It was very therapeutic for him,

and I didn't mind

because he wasn't screaming at me,

he was screaming at death.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<line>
Stars really are just like us, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:34" />

<line>
-Do you mind if I have a sip?

-Don't drink that!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<line>
Right, of course.

I must earn hydration. So sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<line>
No, it's just... that's vodka.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<line>
You think it's a good idea

to keep a bottle of vodka in rehab?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<line>
Because it is if you think it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<line>
It's not for drinking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<line>
I just, I... I don't know why I keep it.

As a reminder, I guess.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<line>
Of what?

<line>
-What?

-Are you almost done?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<line>
I need Sharona to work that magic

on her mane man.

<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<line>
Yeah, I'll get to you in a minute.

Cool your jets.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<line>
Why can't you do this

in Sarah Lynn's dressing room?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<line>
My stepdad's in there,

and he's being weird.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<line>
-Why is that my problem?

-We appreciate your hospitality.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<line>
Hey, BoJack,

what do you think of the new guy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<line>
Danny? Yeah, he's okay. Right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<line>
-I miss Herb.

-We all do, sweetie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:20" />

<line>
Herb. Danny. What difference does it make?

We got a job to do, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<line>
I'm just saying I miss him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<line>
And I'm just saying

it's not my fault he got fired.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<line>
-I dunno why you're complaining to me.

-I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:29" />

<line>
Nobody said it was your fault.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<line>
I actually think

Danny represents an opportunity.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<line>
For a new beginning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<line>
You don't think it feels weird

to do the show without Herb?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<line>
If Herb really cared about the show,

maybe he shouldn't have...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<line>
What? Been gay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<line>
No, that's not-- Obviously...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<line>
-I put my ass on the line for you people.

-Ugh. BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<line>
Do you know how lucky we are to have this?

Herb was gonna throw that all away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<line>
I made the tough choice. What did you do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<line>
-I... I don't know.

-BoJack, she's ten!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<line>
Yeah, which is basically an adult

in Hollywood years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<line>
I'm trying to make this situation work.

Enjoy my dressing room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<line>
[sighs] Hey, I know you feel shitty,

but don't take it out on a little girl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<line>
[BoJack] I don't feel shitty,

I feel great!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<line>
Okay. You know why this is here, Casey?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:13" />

<line>
It's because I think I'm special

and the rules don't apply to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<line>
And I keep thinking that

over and over again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<line>
-Well, you are special.

-No, shut up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<line>
-[gasps]

-That's the problem. I'm an asshole.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<line>
All your bosses are assholes.

And people like you indulge us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<line>
And you soothe our egos,

and you let us abuse you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
-You're right, I'm terrible.

-No, God damn it. That's not my point.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<line>
Have some respect for yourself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<line>
Okay, sorry.

I'm just happy to be a part of things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<line>
Yeah, and that's how they get you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<line>
[sighs] I'm sorry. It's not your fault.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<line>
Can you run downstairs

and grab me some Funyuns?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<line>
-Mm... No.

-What do you mean, no?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<line>
Huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<line>
I don't know. I'm not going to do that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<line>
-Uh, what's happening?

-There's an "I" in "assistants."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<line>
And this time, the "I" is us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
I like your energy, but what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

he's such a sad dog!

[gasps] Mr. Peanutbutter,

we didn't realize

you have a mental illness.

Thank you for getting the word out

about depression.

You are truly a hero for destigmatizing

Yes, a hero!
