</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<line>
Let me be the first to tell you:

I'm bad news.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<line>
You're actually not the first

to tell me that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<line>
I can't offer you parental guidance

or advice or love or support

or prolonged conversation

or interest in you,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
-or remembering your name.

-It's Hollyhock.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<line>
-And I'm not looking for another dad.

-Great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
But I've always wanted to know

who my mother is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<line>
Your mother? What do I look like,

Josh Radnor?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<line>
Nothing? Nothing for Josh Radnor.

How quickly we forget.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<line>
Just tell me the name of the woman

you had sex with in December 1999.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<line>
That's all the relationship

we need to have.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<line>
That was quite a time

for our nation, sex-wise...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<line>
<i>♪ Oh, 1999 ♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<line>
Actually, I don't need a whole long story.

Just get to the point.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<line>
The point is I banged a lot of women.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<line>
One-night stands, two-night stands,

nooners, spooners, hot-air ballooners.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<line>
So, out of all of these women

it sounds like you really respected,

is there any chance

one of them got pregnant

and then put the baby up for adoption?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<line>
I guess Marcy was kind of

a poking holes in the condom type.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<line>
Real nutter. Good lay, though.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<line>
Glad to hear my mother

was a "nutter" and "a good lay."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<line>
Can I meet her? Where is she?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<line>
I bet she's still in that same apartment

in the Valley. What a dump!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<line>
Can you take me there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<line>
Help me find my mom

and I'll leave you alone forever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<line>
Deal. But can we go in the morning?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<line>
[yawning] It's getting pretty late,

I become a real asshole

if I don't get a solid seven hours

of bed drinking a night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<line>
I should get going.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<line>
My hostel's all the way downtown

in a pretty bad area.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<line>
Wait.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<line>
-Take this.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<line>
Here I go, hope there are

no murderers out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:48" />

<line>
Yes, everyone hopes that all the time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<line>
-Okay, just do me a favor.

-Ugh! What now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<line>
If I do get murdered,

will you call my eight dads

and tell them I love them?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:57" />

<line>
I gotta call all eight? They can't

work out a phone tree? [groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<line>
If you're gonna be a baby,

stay here for the night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<line>
-All right!

-Take the couch and be quiet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />

<line>
Don't get on your phone and text

all your friends how sweet my house is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<line>
Turn off all the lights when you're

going to sleep, all of the lights.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:15" />

<line>
[click]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<line>
-Thank you, BoJack.

<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
-[moans] Oh, I can't--

-Oh, you're-- you're in my--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<line>
-Wait, I'm not really--

-What if we try...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<line>
Wait, I'm almost... Oh, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<line>
I don't think it's going to happen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<line>
[sighs] I'm sorry,

it's just difficult with all the--

<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<line>
[air horn blares]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<line>
-[Katrina] Who gave Todd the air horn?

-Right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<line>
-The campaign.

-Exactly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<line>
But it's just another two months, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<line>
{\an8}After the election

everything goes back to normal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<line>
{\an8}-Well, unless I win.

-Right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
I gotta tell you, I'm having a blast.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<line>
I always knew I was probably

good at something,

but I never knew what it was.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<line>
{\an8}Thanks to Katrina, I've finally realized

I'm good at people liking me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<line>
That's great, and you know

I'm so happy for you,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
{\an8}but do you have to be

the pro-fracking candidate?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<line>
{\an8}-[shudders]

-Diane, this is the campaign.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
{\an8}Nothing anyone says

during a campaign matters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<line>
It's just promising a bunch of stuff

to get people to vote for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<line>
Then when you get an office,

you can do whatever you want.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<line>
-Democracy in action.

-Mark my words--

the only fracking

that's going to be happening

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
-is in this bedroom.

-All right, guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<line>
I'm gonna drill you deep,

and fill you with a mysterious substance

that scientists still don't quite

understand the ramifications of.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<line>
{\an8}-This isn't sexy for me-- aaah!

-Did someone say "busy day"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<line>
{\an8}No one said "busy day," Katrina.

What <i>did </i>we say about knocking?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<line>
{\an8}It wastes vital seconds

we'll never get back?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
{\an8}Anyway, everyone who isn't me

needs to shut up right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
{\an8}-No one else was talking.

-I actually have good news for once.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<line>
{\an8}CNN released a poll today,

and for the first time ever,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<line>
{\an8}-Mr. Peanutbutter is up.

-Damn!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
Wow! Am I John Davidson,

Cathy Lee Crosby

and Fran Tarkenton right now,

because that's--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<line>
{\an8}We don't have time for the reference

you're setting up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
{\an8}We're doing a presser in 30.

Go downstairs, get some breakfast.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<line>
{\an8}Yeah! Breakfast!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<line>
{\an8}Am I Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald,

Judd Nelson, the principal...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
{\an8}-Just get breakfast!

-All right!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<line>
-[horn blaring]

-Don't you forget about me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<line>
-Diane, you look sad.

-We were kind of in the middle of--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<line>
No, I'm saying you <i>look </i>sad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
Maybe you need to put on foundation,

blush around the cheeks or something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
[sighs]

-[smoke alarm beeping]

-[moans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<line>
What the...? Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<line>
{\an8}-[electricity crackling]

-Aaah! Aaah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<line>
{\an8}What's going on down here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<line>
I was trying to make you breakfast

to thank you for letting me stay here!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<line>
I put a Pop-Tart in the microwave!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
-Did you take the foil off?

-No! I was doing it popcorn style!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<line>
It's all right, it's not your fault.

Making food is impossible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
Let's get out of here

and take you to your mom's house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
Should we do something about the fire?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<line>
Just leave it.

It'll tire itself out eventually.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
[munching]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<line>
{\an8}So, who is this lady?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<line>
{\an8}It's actually a cute story.

She was the president of my fan club.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
{\an8}You had sex with the president

of your fan club?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
Yeah. "Oh, my God, what a monster!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
I slept with someone who loved me

more than anybody else

and dedicated her life to knowing things

about me and caring about me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
How could I be so shallow?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<line>
{\an8}You're right, I'm sorry.

Finish your cute story.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<line>
That was the whole story.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
She was the president of my fan club,

I had sex with her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<line>
Then I didn't think about her

for 18 years, and here we are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<line>
-[door opens]

-Good news, the results are in!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<line>
-Oh!

-Bad news, the results are bad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
[groaning]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<line>
Like an omelet bar

at a mongoose convention,

you are running dangerously low on eggs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<line>
How many do I have left?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<line>
Well, let's just say

it's more than Harry Potter movies,

but fewer than James Bond movies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<line>
-Doctor, no!

-What do you recommend?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<line>
Hmm. Have you considered

impregnating a younger woman?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<line>
No, I want to do it with this woman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<line>
You could try throwing money

at the problem.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<line>
You're gonna want pre-natal vitamins,

cervical mucus boosters,

a "You Can Do It!" poster,

and an iOvulate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<line>
- "iOvulate"?

- Let's hope so!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<line>
This state-of-the-art bracelet

tracks your cycle

and also gives you up-to-date info

on your ovulation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<line>
-Plus, it's voiced by Harvey Fierstein.

-[chiming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<line>
<i>Hello, I'm Harvey Fierstein.</i>

<i>Let's put a baby in you.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<line>
[both] Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<line>
[exhales]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
Marcy, hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<line>
-I knew it. I knew you'd come back.

-Right. Um...

here's a very specific question:

after we had sex,

did you by any chance get pregnant

and put a baby up for adoption?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<line>
-Yes.

-Wait, really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<line>
Oh, my God, you're my mother.

Can I hug you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
-I'm hugging my mother.

-Wow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
BoJack, I'm sorry,

I really wanted to tell you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
But when I called the number

that you gave me,

it was for a sandwich shop in Temecula.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<line>
Wha...? That's so weird.

You must have dialed it wrong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<line>
And then I thought, well, you know,

sooner or later you'd call me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<line>
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna,

but then, you know, 9/11 happened...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
-Can you ever forgive me?

-I think so.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
Oh! I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?

Please come in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
And that was just such

a tough time for our country...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
So, once we introduced vicious knife-play

into our routine,

it really gave our sex life the edge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<line>
Love it, crooshed it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<line>
So the article is just about

a happy marriage with a healthy sex life?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<line>
We already have Raquel's piece

about 69 days of sixty-nining.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<line>
-Uh-huh!

-So croosh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<line>
What about our readers

who <i>aren't</i> having sex with their husbands?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<line>
Isn't this just gonna make them feel bad?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<line>
Not everyone gets to have

great sex all the time, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
Ladies?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
Diane? Can I talk to you

in your office for a minute?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<line>
I don't have an office.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<line>
You said offices have corners

and corners are the patriarchy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<line>
Fine. Can I talk to you in the hot-take,

cool-down yoga area?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<line>
[deep breathing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<line>
You seem tense.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<line>
Have you been eating gluten

and also not having sex with your husband?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<line>
Whoa, Stefani, that's not--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<line>
Diane, relax! This is not a conversation

between an employee and her superior.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<line>
This is a conversation

between a friend and her superior.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<line>
The campaign

has been testing our marriage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<line>
Obviously, it's great to see

Mr. Peanutbutter so excited,

and I am supporting that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<line>
But if I'm being honest,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
I can't wait for it to be over

so things can go back to normal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
-Hmm. And what happens if he wins?

-He's not going to win.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
Did you see the new CNN poll this morning?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
He could win. People do love fracking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<line>
It's fun to say! "Frack! Frack!

Fricky-fricky-frack" [laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<line>
People wouldn't love saying it

if they understood what it actually was.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<line>
-So tell them.

-I can't go against my husband.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<line>
What the frack? Why not?

You gotta do you, girl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<line>
I always say, you gotta do you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<line>
And if he's doing him,

then who's doing you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
Because right now,

it seems like no one's doing you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<line>
...and then when I was eight,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
Lizzie Dunbar's mom rented us all

<i>Freaky Friday</i> for a sleepover,

and I got really sad because I realized

I didn't have a mom to switch bodies with.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
Am I talking a lot?

I feel I'm talking a lot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
-Yes.

-Oh! I need to show you something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<line>
Okay, so this may seem cuckoo,

but I was so head over heels

in love with your father

that after we made sweet love,

and he didn't call me again,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<line>
I just got so jealous, so I made a list

of every girl he was with...

and I found their home addresses...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
-Oh.

-...and drew Xs over their eyes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<line>
I'm loving this conversation

but I have to go the bathroom now,

for non-me being weirded out

by this conversation-related reasons.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>
I just keep thinking about

how different things would have been

if you'd have just called me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<line>
We could have had a family together

for 18 loving years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<line>
-That might have--

-[Hollyhock] BoJack!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
[groans] Kids. What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<line>
Can you join me

in the bathroom for a minute?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<line>
What?! No!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
-Do you want me, sweetheart?

-No, it's a dad bathroom thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<line>
Uh... Hollyhock?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
That woman is not my mother.

She's lying to us!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<line>
Marcy? No way!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
Look. This is from the premiere

of <i>Autumn in New York.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<line>
That movie came out in August of 2000.

I was born in September.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<line>
Does this woman look

eight months pregnant to you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<line>
Why would they release a romantic drama

called <i>Autumn in New York</i>

in the middle of summer?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<line>
Richard Gere

had just done <i>Runaway Bride,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
Winona Ryder was hot off

<i>Girl, Interrupted</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<line>
-so the studio got cocky.

-How do you know all this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<line>
I looked it up on the Internet

because I saw this picture

and got confused why Marcy

would wear a summer dress

to a movie called

<i>Autumn in New York.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<line>
This is a summer dress?

I guess I don't know dresses.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<line>
BoJack, focus! That's not my mom!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<line>
So the lesson here is

I was right to never call her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
-Wait, so who--

-[Marcy] Are you okay in there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
-Don't come in!

-Yes! Father-daughter bathroom time!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<line>
The scrapbook! She has that list

of all the other women you slept with.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<line>
If we get the book, we can find my mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
Give me a few minutes. I'll distract her,

then you sneak in and grab the book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
[BoJack] Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
And what was the first appearance

of the Horse's identical cousin?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<line>
[Marcy] Season eight, episode four.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<line>
[BoJack] Yeah, yeah. That's right.

What was the horse's boss's name?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
-What are you doing?

-Oh, my God!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<line>
You're not supposed to see this.

Look away!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
It's okay, Hollyhock.

This is what Mommy and Daddy do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<line>
-Ugh! You said give you a few minutes!

-I didn't think it would take this long.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<line>
I usually finish faster.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<line>
-You're disgusting!

-[moans] That's what I needed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<line>
-Can I please have a grasshopper?

-[seductively] Yes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<line>
So the studio finished<i> Mars Attacks!</i>

without him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<line>
And since no one ever found a body,

my client Tony Tromboni

has been making movies

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<line>
-under the name Tim Burton ever since.

-Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<line>
-[chiming]

-<i>I'm Harvey Fierstein.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<line>
<i>Your ovulation window is closing soon.</i>

<i>Please commence copulation.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
Oh, fish! We gotta go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
-Can't we finish lunch?

-You heard the bracelet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<line>
Okay, well, uh, let me get the check.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<line>
-There's no time for that! Ralph!

-We gotta pay for our--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
I have an egg inside me

that is ripe to be fertilized.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<line>
His name is Philbert.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
-Princess Carolyn--

-Uh-uh! Philbert Stilton,

and he's going to be sweet and smart

and a phenom on the clarinet,

and one day you'll be driving him home

from band practice

and he's going to all of a sudden

say something so insightful and true

that you'll be positively floored

it came out of the mouth of your son.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<line>
But if you don't take me home right now

and impregnate me,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<line>
-then Philbert will never exist.

-[plates clatter]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<line>
Okay, let's go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<line>
-You told me to distract her.

-We don't need to talk about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
So now that we got the list,

we gotta go see all these other women?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
Not all of them,

just the ones you didn't see

in the nine months

after you had sex with them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<line>
-That's gonna be most of them.

-Yeah, figures.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<line>
Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<line>
Tilda Madison? You dated the Timedium,

Tuesdays at 9:00 on CBS?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<line>
I never understood that show.

What's a Timedium?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
She's a medium,

but she can also travel through time

and she solves crimes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<line>
That's so stupid.

She time-travels and she's a medium?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<line>
But the one crime she can't solve

is her husband's murder.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
[sitar playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<line>
So my name is Hollyhock and I love apples

but hate applesauce, too slimy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<line>
I was the captain of the JV soccer team--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<line>
BoJack, why did you bring this child

into my sanctum?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<line>
I can make this real quick.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<line>
Did you give up my secret baby

in the year 2000?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<line>
Oh, BoJack, do you recall

the impetus for our uncoupling?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<line>
Is every one of these

gonna be a whole thing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<line>
You were a cad and a boor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<line>
But your fits of sardonic japery amused,

to a point, until you impregnated me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<line>
Suddenly, I was awash in dreams

of idealized domesticity.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<line>
But when I told you I was with child,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<line>
I received a check in the mail

for $200 with the memo line,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<line>
"BoJack's half of the abortion."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<line>
So you put me up for adoption?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<line>
Child, no. I had the abortion.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<line>
Nice. You don't want

any little BoJacks floating around.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<line>
Last thing this world needs

is more of this garbage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<line>
-Uh, excuse me?

-No, you're great, you seem cool,

but if we could go back in time

and prevent it...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<line>
-Right?

-[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<line>
Hollyhock, I didn't mean...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
By the way, your show sucks.

Should be called <i>Tedium.</i>

So in conclusion, I don't think California

is the greatest state in the country.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />

<line>
But it can be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<line>
{\an8}Beautifully put.

I'd like to drill down, as it were,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<line>
{\an8}-on the subject of fracking.

-Drill away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

{\an8}Now, mere hours ago

your wife, Diane Nguyen,

<line>
{\an8}published an essay online

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<line>
{\an8}in which she posits, quote...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<line>
{\an8}"If these frack-happy politicians

even knew how dangerous it was,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<line>
{\an8}they wouldn't allow it

in their own backyards."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<line>
-Diane wrote that?

-Damn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
{\an8}Mr. Peanutbutter,

your wife has issued a challenge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<line>
{\an8}Would you allow fracking

in your own backyard?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<line>
{\an8}I would.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<line>
{\an8}Joining us now via Periscope

-Flackery Flack, let's talk frack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<line>
{\an8}Mr. Peanutbutter has invited you

to drill on his property.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<line>
{\an8}-Uh--

-Will you take him up on this invitation?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

{\an8}-I could have a team there this afternoon.

-Oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<line>
{\an8}Ready when you are, boys!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:20" />

<line>
Sir, I apologize.

We are very eager to get home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<line>
You were going 36 miles per hour.

The speed limit here...

is 35.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<line>
-Yes.

-Now, I'm no mathematician.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<line>
-I'm just a humble officer of the law.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<line>
So you tell me, is 36 below 35

or is it above 35?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<line>
Just write us a ticket and let us go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<line>
Now, now, talking back

to Officer Meow Meow is a major no-no.

<line>
Don't tell me to calm down

or call me ma'am!

<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<line>
Just write us a goddamn ticket

so I can go home and mount my boyfriend!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<line>
That's enough!

Out of the car, all three of you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<line>
Obviously, I didn't mean you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<line>
You're giving me the silent treatment?

<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<line>
I guess I have thin skin.

<timestamp data-time="00:17:11" />

<line>
Must be the half of me

that's made of garbage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<line>
[sighs] Well, who else is on this list?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:17" />

<line>
Stacy, Fabiana... Tonya Harding?

She is not gonna be happy to see me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<line>
She said sleeping with me

is the worst thing she ever did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<line>
I'm sorry it's so unpleasant for you

to have to interact

with women you were shitty to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
I don't understand

why we're even doing this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<line>
You're never gonna switch bodies

with your mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<line>
That ship has sailed

and is also impossible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<line>
-Pull over the car.

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<line>
-Pull over now!

-Jesus. Fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<line>
-I'm gonna do the rest of this on my own.

-No. Hollyhock.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<line>
I got the list. I don't need you anymore.

Have a bad life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<line>
Joke's on you, I already have one!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<line>
Oh no. No. No, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<line>
Where's Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<line>
He's giving a stump speech

on the subject of stumps.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<line>
-Turns out he's pro. Great for sitting.

-[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<line>
I'd be careful with that faucet,

the water comes out very hot

because of the fracking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<line>
Aaah! How could you let him do this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<line>
You're the one who called his bluff.

Don't do that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<line>
-This just makes my job harder.

-I didn't "call his bluff." I just--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<line>
Woman, you have one job:

be his wife, be supportive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<line>
I <i>am </i>being supportive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<line>
Was that you being supportive today

with that piece you wrote

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<line>
-for your stupid girl website?

-It's called Girl Croosh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<line>
"Stoopid Gurl" is just a subsection

of the main site.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<line>
And my piece wasn't about

Mr. Peanutbutter, specifically.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<line>
I'm gonna cut this conversation short,

my time is more important than yours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<line>
This goes one of two ways.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
Either you shut up and be pretty,

or your approximation of that,

or don't support him, he resents you,

your marriage implodes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
-Pick your poison.

-Damn!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
Not that I get to vote, but from

one Mrs. Peanutbutter to another,

it's been really fun for me

to watch this new marriage fall apart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<line>
-We're not.

-So thank you, Diane,

for that tiny sliver of mint

in the smoothie of dogshit

that is trying to get

that popular idiot elected.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
Good night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<line>

I'm sorry we couldn't get home in time.

Hey! You two cut that out!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<line>
I'll write you up for lewd conduct.

Lewd, crude and partially nude!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

Not to mention the rude 'tude

Hi, Fabiana. Before you slam the door--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
Did a young horse girl come by here,

about yay high?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<line>
You're still mad about your dad's funeral?

That was 18 years ago!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<line>
Thank you, Tonya.

I know we've had our differences,

but seeing you always leaves me

weak in the knees.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>

-[grunts]

-Hollyhock.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<line>
-Was that her?

-Ugh! No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<line>
I talked to 23 women today

and none of them were my mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<line>
-How did you find me?

-I went to everyone on that list.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
You talked to all those women?

Some of them--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<line>
-Really haven't aged well, I know.

-I was gonna say, really hate you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<line>
Oh, yeah, that too.

But I needed to find you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<line>
To tell you I'm sorry,

for being such an asshole

then and also now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<line>
This whole thing was stupid.

I never should have come out here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<line>
And I don't even care

about having a mom, really.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<line>
Because I did fine

for 17 years without one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
I don't need a mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<line>
Hollyhock, it's okay to want a mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<line>
No, it's not! Because that means my dads

weren't enough for me, and they are!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<line>
I know I just met you,

but if you do have

any of the old Horseman gunk

bouncing around in that brain of yours,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<line>
I gotta tell you right now

you should give up on looking for "enough"

because it will never be enough.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<line>
[whimpering]

<line>
-[sobbing]

-Eww!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<line>
-Stop that.

-I know, it's stupid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<line>
-There, there.

-You are so bad at this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<line>
What do your dads say when you cry?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
They say it's okay to cry,

and that I shouldn't feel bad

about feeling bad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<line>
Well, that-- that's good advice, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<line>
They're really good dads.

I should probably get back to them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<line>
Oh. You don't have to leave right away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<line>
Why don't you just

stay with me a bit longer?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<line>
At least until we find your mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<line>
How are we supposed to do that?

Every name on that list was a dead end.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<line>
Oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<line>
Yeah. But what if I told you

there's a name that isn't on that list?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<line>
Someone Marcy never knew about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<line>
What? Where is she now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
I don't know. But you can stay with me

while we try to find her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<line>
Okay. Yeah. What's her name?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<line>
Her name was Brown Car... la.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<line>
Carla Mercedes Benz... Brown.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<line>
"Carla Mercedes Benzbrown"?

Weird name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<line>
-You've got a weird name.

-I guess you're right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
Maybe that's the first thing

we'll talk about when I meet her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<line>
Mm-hmm?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<line>
[keyboard clicking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
Diane, I know. I'm sorry about the trucks,

but you didn't give me much choice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<line>
I know these last few days

have been crazy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<line>
-But this is the hard part.

-I need you to drop out of the race.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<line>
-What?

-Please, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<line>
This isn't worth it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<line>
I hear what you're saying

and I will try to be more conscientious

of your needs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<line>
-Drop out of the race.

-Because your needs are important.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<line>
I've written another piece

for Girl Croosh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
It's called

"The Case Against Mr. Peanutbutter."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<line>
When I hit this button,

the post goes live.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
Diane, don't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
I don't want to.

And I won't, if you drop out of the race.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<line>
Jesus, Diane. You can't do that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<line>
Because you're the only one allowed

to make decisions for this family?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<line>
No. Because it's gonna come off

as a weird lovers' spat

and it's just going to embarrass everyone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
-Well, I'm sorry if I embarrass you.

-Oh, come on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<line>
You told me you weren't going to frack,

and now I can't

turn on a faucet in my own home

without getting third-degree burns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<line>
Oh, I get it. So like always,

you're mad at someone,

so your solution is to air

your dirty laundry for everyone to see.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />

<line>
No. This is not about <i>us.</i>

I don't want <i>you </i>to be governor

because you would be bad at it,

because you don't stand for anything.
