- Huh?

- Oh, uh, it's a pet name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<line>
- I don't have actual honey.

- [sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
- [laughter]

- Diane!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<line>
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

Mwah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<line>
BoJack Horseman!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<line>
- Put her there!

- That's all right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
I'm gonna get

that handshake.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<line>
No, you're not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<line>
[laughs]

Since when am I Honey?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<line>
Since now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<line>
I made up the nickname

while you were back east.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<line>
Yeah, really? You made up

calling someone honey?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<line>
Uh, I do believe so. Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<line>
Hey, why don't we give

BoJack a ride?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<line>
That's okay.

Todd's supposed to pick me up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<line>
Where is he?

Well, stick with me.

You're gonna be just fi--

<line>
Probably just forgot,

the lazy bum.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<line>
Hey, I'll take the ride

as long as it's not as bumpy

as that pilot's landing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<line>
That was seriously

very scary.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<line>
- Hey...

- I'm just glad you were there,

because I really would have

freaked out by myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<line>
Be stiller,

my beating heart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<line>
Stiller crazy

after all these years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
- [laughter]

- Did I miss something funny?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<line>
- I love funny somethings.

- No, we were just laughing

about this Ben Stiller article

from the plane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<line>
- [laughter]

- Ooh, he is the best.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<line>
- What did it say?

- You wouldn't get it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<line>
Either you read <i>Hemisphere's</i>

<i>Magazine, </i>or you don't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<line>
Hey, I might be crazy, because

this is such a dumb question,

and I'm embarrassed

to even ask,

but do I have anything to worry

about with you and Diane?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<line>
What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<line>
[laughs]

What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<line>
Get out of here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<line>
I got to say, BoJack,

that is a relief.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<line>
Ho-ho! Whoo!

Hey, do you guys

want to grab dinner?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<line>
{\an8}Or at least some road sodas,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:39" />

<line>
{\an8}so I don't have

to go through the ordeal

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<line>
{\an8}of sobering up and then having

to get drunk all over again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, I actually already made

special plans

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<line>
{\an8}for just the two of us.

<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, come on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:48" />

<line>
You're the one

who's always saying

you want to hang out

with BoJack more,

and how it's weird that BoJack

never returns your calls,

and how I should

hang up the phone

because maybe BoJack's

trying to call you right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<line>
Uh, okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<line>
{\an8}I guess we can

make this work.

<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<line>
- [laughter]

- Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:03" />

<line>
Oh, man.

Remember that guy in 34-B?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<line>
Do I? Can't stop

remembering him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:08" />

<line>
Uh, hey.

Diane and I have memories, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<line>
{\an8}This place reminds me

of a cliffside meal we had

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<line>
{\an8}one romantic vacay to Cabo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
Boring. I wasn't there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<line>
Can we keep this

general interests?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<line>
{\an8}Well, here's to a meal

we're all here for.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<line>
Mmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<line>
Oh, oh. Ew.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<line>
There's something

in my food.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<line>
Ah, crap.

Someone get the manager.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<line>
No, no, no. Wait.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<line>
It's supposed to be in there.

Welcome home, honey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<line>
{\an8}I got you a D pendant,

because I am D-pendant on you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
- Thank you.

- Yeah. Real-- Real cute.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<line>
- A D for dog.

- It's for Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<line>
This is the sweetest choking

hazard anyone's ever given me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<line>
- [moans]

- Mwah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<line>
Well, how about some champagne

for the happy couple.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<line>
{\an8}Waiter, get me

a bottle of Dom

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
{\an8}to keep with the trend

of sweet D gifts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<line>
You're too kind,

but everyone knows you go off

menu for the good stuff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<line>
{\an8}Yes, get me your most expensive

bottle from the back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
{\an8}Perhaps a 1922-ish Heidsieck

Diamant Bleu?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<line>
{\an8}A toast on me

to Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<line>
I'd like a round of drinks

for everyone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<line>
Off the menu, of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
{\an8}- [all cheering]

- BoJack, folks. What a sport.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
{\an8}And while we're all

in giving moods,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<line>
{\an8}I'd like to buy you all an Xbox,

courtesy of me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<line>
[all cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<line>
Wow. You guys don't

have to do this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<line>
Look, I could happily

go down this petty road

of raising and re-raising

one another.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<line>
[man] Please do!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<line>
{\an8}But I'd instead

like to highlight the fact

that Mr. Peanutbutter's

ripping off my toast

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<line>
{\an8}the same way he ripped off

my entire career.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<line>
[man 2] Uh, we prefer gifts

over observations.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<line>
Okay. Well, here's something

I didn't rip off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<line>
This brand new helicopter

I just bought.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<line>
Whoo-whoo! Who wants a ride

in the chopper?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<line>
- [applause and cheering]

- Okay, guys. This has been fun,

and also an offensive display

of extravagant wealth,

but maybe we should

call it a night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<line>
What's the rush?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<line>
Because I just bought

the restaurant,

and we can stay

as long as we want.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<line>
- [all cheering]

- Hey, you. I own you now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<line>
- Do a dance.

- [scats]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<line>
Oops.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<line>
[laughs]

Oh, no. Hey, sorry, bud.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<line>
- It's all yours.

- Please, you first.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<line>
Apparently, we both

like to be clean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<line>
I love being clean.

That's so coincidental.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<line>
- I'm Todd.

- Klaus.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<line>
Look, I know

you're new here,

but we have a lot in common:

being white, into cleansing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<line>
I think you'd enjoy hanging out

with me and the gang.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
When you say "the gang,"

do you mean a gang?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<line>
Check this out.

If you want to lift weights,

we got great yard

connections.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<line>
If you like toilet wine,

we spent the past 20 years

perfecting pruno.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
The Aryan nation is number one

for a reason.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
Never thought I'd say this,

but you put a pretty good

spin on Nazis.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<line>
Hey, tell you what.

Drop by our party tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
Shoot the shit with the guys,

mostly about Jews,

and make up your own mind.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
Until then,

take my card.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<line>
Whoa. Uh, where were you

keeping that card?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<line>
[both] Forty-five, forty-six,

forty-seven...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<line>
Guys, can we give this thing

a rest?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
Rest? Why rest?

I'm not tired.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
I'm twice as not tired.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>

<line>
Todd, where the hell

have you been?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<line>
I had to carpool home

from the airport

like a goddamn

environmentalist.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<line>
I'm sorry,

but I'm in jail, dude.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<line>
Well, you called the right

person, because I need your help

and you're my

phone-a-friend.

Marie Curie won Nobel prizes

in which two sciences?

<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<line>
- B, biology and physics--

- Oh, B! The answer's B!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<line>
- It's A!

- Damn it, Todd!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<line>
This was life or death.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<line>
Night, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<line>
Good night, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<line>
Give me a bottle of something

to help me forget my problems.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
Ooh, maybe not that strong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<line>
What is this,

breakfast?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

Hey, D-voted memoirist.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<line>
I can't work on the book today.

Too ill. Cough.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
Are you ill,

or hung-over?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<line>
Because instead of coughing

you just said the word cough.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<line>
Plus you left me a long,

drunken voicemail last night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<line>
Ooh, was it bad?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
It was mostly a lot

of wheezing,

as if you were

climbing something,

followed by the sounds

of dismantling metal,

and then grunting like you were

dragging something heavy

at least a few miles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
I didn't say anything

incriminating, did I?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<line>
As incriminating

as that question? No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<line>
Good. Well, just as

a general rule,

you probably shouldn't

be listening

to any voicemails

I leave after--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<line>
- What time do I start drinking?

- Noon?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<line>
- Yup. See you later.

- But we had an appointment.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<line>
What's that? An actor flaking

on an obligation?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<line>
- Welcome to Hollywood.

- I think you mean Hollywoo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<line>
Did you see? Someone stole the D

off the sign.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<line>
Cough, cough, cough,

cough, cough.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<line>
Cough, cough, cough,

cough, door slam.

<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

You know, I'm tied up

with all my Deans today.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
Kane, Norris, Winters,

and Koontz,

all being questioned

by police.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
It was me. I stole the D.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<line>
- What?

<i>- Now be a good agent</i>

and make this

not my problem.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<line>
How did you even--?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
You know, your scandal-to-work

ratio is, like, five to one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
Look, I need to get rid

of this before Diane sees it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
Why do you

care if Dia-- Oh, fish.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<line>
Are you in love

with your biographer?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<line>
<i>[laughs]</i>

<i>What?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<line>
Get out of here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<line>
You stole the D for Diane.

Unbelievable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<line>
Yeah, I don't know.

The D might be for David,

because apparently

when I was drunk,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<line>
I printed out a bunch

of pictures of David Boreanaz.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
Yeah. You did that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<line>
Look, I'll keep your little

crush busy long enough

for you to get rid

of the contraband,

but the next three weddings

I'm invited to,

you're my date, dummy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<line>
Since when to women your age

get invited to weddings?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<line>
I have a lot

of nieces and nephews!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<line>
[phone beeps off]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<line>
- [claps]

- Well, you pulled it off,

you deviant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
Get it? D-viant?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<line>
- I got it.

- Tell me,

how are you gonna complete

your giant bracelet?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<line>
With the chain-link fence

from Dodger's Stadium?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
No. How'd you figure out

it was me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<line>
Oh, how did I figure it out?

Well, I just followed the clues,

used deduction, puzzle-solving,

a little bit of forensics,

and also,

what did I do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<line>
Oh, I listened to the voicemail

you left me

saying you were stealing the D

because of Diane

so I could, and I quote,

"Suck your D."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<line>
Stop leaving voicemails!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>
Admit it!

You like my girlfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<line>
Oh, come on. I mean,

am I attracted to her? Sure.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<line>
Do my days feel better

when I'm around her? Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<line>
Does she get me in ways

no woman ever has? Indubitably.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
Do I fantasize about her?

Yes, but only in two positions.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<line>
Look, am I the kind of guy

who would try to steal

someone else's girlfriend?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<line>
Sure, of course,

but do I like her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<line>
The answer's no.

You have nothing to worry about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<line>
I'll cut you a deal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
I help you get rid

of that D,

and you never talk

to Diane again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
Well, I have to talk to her,

because she's writing my book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
Okay, but just don't

pursue her romantically?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<line>
- Deal.

- Ha!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
- I knew I'd get that handshake.

- I regret this already.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<line>
Spread them wide, ladies.

This is a random cavity search.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<line>
[both] Whoa!

Buy a guy a drink first.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<line>
- [laughs]

- Did we just say that...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<line>
- Oh!

- ...at the same time?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<line>
Look, I saw you talking

to Klaus in the shower.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
Now, the Aryans are good guys,

don't get me wrong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
But I don't know

if you're gonna get

the right attention

over there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<line>
Uh, I'd hate to get lost

in a shop that big.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
Now we can't

offer you the works,

but in the Latin Kings,

you'll be a star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<line>
We're number two,

and that means we try harder.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<line>
Am I really being courted

by two gangs?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
Oh, I feel like

the belle of the ball.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
So, this is the shapeless

biographer

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<line>
I've heard so much about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<line>
We've met several times.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<line>
Did you just call me here

to insult me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<line>
What is your secret, lady?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<line>
I mean, how do you get

two grown men fighting over you

like a foul ball

at a football game?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<line>
First of all, football doesn't

have foul balls.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<line>
Ugh, sports.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
Second of all,

nobody's fighting over me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<line>
Open your eyes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<line>
BoJack's clearly

in love with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<line>
Wha--?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<line>
Get out of here!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
Get out of here?

Why would I get out of here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<line>
You get out of here.

This is my office.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
I get the army men are police,

but what's the mustard packet

again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<line>
Oh, that's just

a mustard packet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<line>
- It's left over from lunch.

- Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<line>
Well, can we move it

off the table?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
No. I still might

want it later.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<line>
Good call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<line>
So how do we get

the D from here

all the way up to here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<line>
What, with all these cops

and mustards,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
- it's gonna be a pickle.

- Oh, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<line>
The pickle's a SWAT van,

but I see your point.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
Might be easier to just ditch

the evidence. But how?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
I-- I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<line>
You think these coffees

would get the juices flowing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<line>
Well, they do have Bailey's

in them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
Is that why I feel drunk?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<line>
Because I've had, like,

seven or eight coffees.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
I mean, I admit,

it's been bad for ideas,

but it's been great

for camaraderie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<line>
Couldn't agree more.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<line>
Ooh, hey.

What time is it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<line>
I probably need

to move my helicopter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
It's in a two-hour zone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<line>
You beautiful bastard,

that's it!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<line>
We can pick up the D with your

chopper, fly it out of here,

and then dump it

out into the ocean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<line>
Stupendous!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<line>
Take that, the ocean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<line>
[phone vibrates and rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<line>
- What now, Todd?

<i>- Listen.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<line>
So, kind of landed myself in a

two-dates-to-the-prom situation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
The dates being prison gangs

and the prom being a jump-in,

so do you remember how you got

out of the same jam

on <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<line>
Ah, a classic conundrum.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<line>
Well, I recall one time

on <i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House--</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<line>
I think he's talking to me,

pal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<line>
You know, the guy

whose show

invented the

two-dates-to-the-prom story.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
You may have invented it, but

I think our show perfected it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<line>
The only thing

you ever perfected

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<line>
- was stealing my thunder.

- Stealing your thunder, eh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<line>
Now you're even stealing

the words I'm saying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<line>
<i>You know, it's tough.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
I agree with the Latin Kings

on social issues,

but fiscally

I'm more of an Aryan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<line>
Well, juggling both

never ends well.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

anything to contribute?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<line>
He's just staring blankly now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<line>
Stealing your thunder.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<line>
You could also just

bail me out of here, as I said.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<line>
<i>- It's only 50 bucks--</i>

- Got to go, pal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<line>
Hope it's a magical night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<line>
All right,

you ready for the plan?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<line>
Oh, yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<line>
But we are gonna need

a big distraction

to keep the eyes

off the skies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<line>
You leave that to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<line>
Whoa, wait.

You had a lot to drink.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<line>
You better have

a cup of coffee.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<line>

</line>

Don't bother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<line>
No, it's still free,

spendable money.

</line>

That's Mr. Peanutbutter.

You're right.

It's Mr. Peanutbutter all over.

they base movies on.

Even if he stole

your stealing of the D,

what he made his was telling

Diane how he felt

from his heart.

You could never

and you still

can't say it to her.

<line>
Well, that's because

it wasn't for you.

That wasn't a Diane thing.

It was a Mr. Peanutbutter thing.

<line>
Well, what would be

a Diane thing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<line>
A Diane thing would be

something that shows

he really knows you,

like giving you an iPod loaded

with all your favorite podcasts,

or a practical houseplant,

or surprising you

with a bound album

of photos and emails

he saved.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

That's-- That's what the Diane

I know would want.

<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
What are you saying to me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

Just that you should be

with someone

who knows you.
