Guys, I think we could use

another phone jack over here.

Cabracadabra.

We wanna reach out and grab you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<line>
-No, we're a cab company.

-Can you toss me the thing?

</line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

-Sorry. The other thing.

-[Todd] Okay. Watch the couch.

Hey. Goddammit!

-I apologize for... I understand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
Mind if I put you on hold one second?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<line>
Don't put me on hold.

Do you know who I am?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<line>
I just won a Baby's Choice Award,

the winner of which

has gone to take home the Oscar

seven of the last 15 years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<line>
So, yeah, <i>that </i>BoJack Horseman.

sending your dumb newspaper to

-We have a situation, sir.

-Talk to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<line>
{\an8}Guy's name is BoJack Horseman.

He's pretty steamed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<line>
{\an8}I've tried everything, but we might need

to bring the Closer in on this one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<line>
Calm down. We can sort this out

without having to get the Closer involved.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<line>
Did you offer 26 weeks

at 50 percent off the newsstand price?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<line>
I went through the entire checklist, sir.

Even offered him a free tote bag.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:33" />

<line>
What kind of monster says no

to a tote bag? Good work, rep.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:37" />

<line>
You've done all that could be

expected of you. I'll take it from here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<line>
Yeah, Got it. Right.

I understand. I'll take it from here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:46" />

<line>
God help us...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:47" />

<line>
Is what I'd say if we needed God's help.

Fortunately, we got one better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:51" />

<line>
Morning. Good morning.

How was your weekend? How are you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<line>
Good work yesterday.

Get out of my way, please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<line>
[sighing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:59" />

<line>
We have a situation on line two.

Name's Horseman. BoJack Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<line>
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<line>
Hello, good morning, and I say this

with 100 percent sincerity...

{\an8}I never subscribed to the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

I do not read the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<line>
{\an8}I have called this number so many times

to stop sending it to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:14" />

<line>
{\an8}Yet every morning, I open my door

on a new edition of the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<line>
{\an8}It's like I'm in a boring episode

of <i>The Twilight Zone.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<line>
{\an8}Sir, we are going to unravel this mystery.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<line>
{\an8}But before we dig in,

is there anything I can get you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<line>
{\an8}A glass of ice water perhaps?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<line>
{\an8}Yeah, sure, I'd love a glass of ice water.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<line>
{\an8}Fabulous. Johnny will get that to you

in three, two, one...

</line>

<line>
{\an8}-[drone whirring]

-Uh... huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<line>
{\an8}I see you've been receiving

our paper for six months,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<line>
{\an8}but there's no record of you

ever registering a complaint.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<line>
{\an8}From whence the hostility, counselor?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<line>
{\an8}It wasn't a problem until recently,

because up until a week ago

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
{\an8}the boy who lives with me used the paper

to make a giant paper-mâché Todd head.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<line>
{\an8}-What was that?

-I live with my best friend, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
{\an8}Good kid, but sometimes

he gets ideas to do things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<line>
[groaning, screaming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<line>
{\an8}-Pretty scary, right?

-Yes. What the hell is that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<line>
{\an8}Giant Todd Head, of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<line>
{\an8}I've been working on him

for the last six months.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
{\an8}What? Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
{\an8}It all started

when a rustling from the kitchen

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
{\an8}jostled me from tender slumber.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
Someone or something is stealing our food.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<line>
I made a giant papier-mâché Todd head

to scare it away. Think it'll work?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
If I made a giant papier-mâché me head,

would you stop eating my food?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<line>
You should take this seriously.

We might have an infestation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
We do have an infestation, of Todds.

Look at that, they're getting bigger.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
And? Did the head help to ameliorate

your pest peccadillo?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<line>
No. Todd abandoned the project as soon

as he started working on Cabracadabra.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
<i>-What's Cabracadabra?</i>

-That's what I said.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<line>
-What's Cabracadabra?

-That's what I said.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<line>
-What's Cabracadabra?

-That's what we want you to say.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
If I didn't know any better,

you were about to pitch an idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<line>
-We <i>are </i>about to pitch you an idea.

-I did not know better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
Has this ever happened to you?

Hey, where you headed?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
Oh, yes. That happens to me all the time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<line>
-We're not at the main part yet.

-I'm so sorry. Please continue.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
-To the opera, good sir.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<line>
Am I watching to see if the whole thing

has happened to me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
-Or looking for one specific thing?

-Kind of both.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<line>
So I just keep watching until I see

something that has happened to me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<line>
-Yes.

-What if we get to the end,

none of it has ever happened to me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
Maybe just try to put yourself

in Emily's shoes right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
Got it. Sorry for the interruption.

Please continue.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<line>
-So, is this where you live?

-Yes, it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<line>
-Alone or are you in a relationship?

-This hardly seems appropriate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
Driver, you're starting

to make me feel uncomfortable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<line>
Yeah, Todd. What are you doing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<line>
Has a creepy driver

ever given you his number

or told you that you reminded him

of his dead girlfriend?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<line>
Or repeated your address slowly,

like he was trying to memorize it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<line>
-No, never.

-Unfortunately, if you are a woman

all those things

would happen to you every day.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<line>
That's right, Todd.

According to my own research,

nine out of ten men

are total dirtbag creeps, just the worst.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
But what if there was a ride-share service

that could guarantee

no creepy men drivers

because there are no men drivers at all?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<line>
What are you saying, robot drivers?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<line>
What if they become sentient

and try to murder us, or unionize?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<line>
That could be a real headache.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<line>
No, not murderous robots. Women.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<line>
Todd, you have done it again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<line>
Actually, Emily and I

came up with it together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<line>
Todd and Emily,

you've done it again for the first time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<line>
And that's why we're setting up shop

at your house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<line>
Why does it have to be my house?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
There's no room

at Mr. Peanutbutter's house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
It's full of spaghetti strainers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<line>
-Why?

-Who can recall?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
I figure the longer they're there,

the bigger the payoff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<line>
And they've been sitting there

for months now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<line>
So you can bet

the payoff's going to be pretty huge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

[The Closer]

<i>So, why did you let them use your house?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
Hey, Todd, where do you want this...?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<line>
[both]

Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<line>
[BoJack] <i>I felt guilty.</i>

[The Closer] <i>About what?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<line>
[BoJack] <i>Todd had this old girlfriend.</i>

<i>I met her a couple weeks back.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<line>
-Hey.

-Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<line>
-What are you still doing up?

-I got thirsty.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
Then you came to the right place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
Should we call Todd,

see if he wants to join us?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<line>
I'm tired of trying to figure out

what Todd wants.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:49" />

<line>
And what do you want?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
-I'll start with a whiskey.

-My kind of girl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<line>
-So then we had sex.

-What? Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
I was lonely? She was there?

Why does anyone have sex with anyone?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<line>
<i>Intimacy, affection, a deep need</i>

<line>
Agreed. A wonderful, sexy mistake

for you and a regular mistake for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<line>
No, it was a regular mistake for me, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

-What are we gonna tell Todd?

-Nothing, obviously.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<line>
-I don't want to hurt him.

-Neither do I.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<line>
-That's why we won't tell him.

-I feel like we should tell him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<line>
That feeling is you selfishly

trying to assuage your guilt.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<line>
If you cared about Todd,

you would keep this a secret forever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<line>
I'm not good at lying.

<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

Ask me if when I was a little girl,

did I ever used to put a stuffed animal

in my underpants

and rock back and forth on it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<line>
When you were a little girl,

did you ever do that thing you said?

<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
What? Get-- [stammers] No!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<line>
I think it's gonna be fine.

Why would it even come up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<line>
Not like there's any reason

the three of us

would ever be in a room together again.

</line>

BoJack, you remember Emily, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

-I've never seen you before in my life.

-No.

-You don't remember BoJack?

-Oh, yeah. BoJack.

<line>
What... why... What are you here?

Why are you doing at Todd's house?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
Todd's house? This is my house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
It's cool if we set up shop here, right?

That's not gonna be weird?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<line>
What? Why would that be weird?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<line>
-What are you implying?

-Nothing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<line>
It's not weird for me either,

if we're keeping track of weirdnesses.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<line>
-Okay, what is going on here?

-Why would you? I don't even--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<line>
-Literally nothing going on.

-No, something's going on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<line>
I've got a nose for news.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<line>
In this case, Nu is the Greek letter

representing the variable

for "What Is Going On?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<line>
So let's solve for Nu, shall we?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<line>
I think someone's not saying something

to someone else about something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<line>
-That's crazy.

-I know what it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<line>
Cabracadabra's going to be huge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
No one wants to say it out loud

because we're afraid we'll jinx it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
Yeah. That is exactly what it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<line>
Yes. Your stupid business

is gonna be very successful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<line>
-Yes.

-Glad that's out in the open.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
We all know what everyone was thinking,

we don't need to ask

any more questions

or do any wondering about mysteries.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<line>
Nope.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<line>
If you'll excuse me,

I need to go watch a sport.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
Great idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<line>
The worst part is things have actually

been going really well with Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
Our friendship is in a really good place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

Last week he said,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<line>
"Did you know the wiener dog

is neither a wiener nor a dog?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<line>
Instead of saying,

"Shut up, Todd," I said, "Okay."

<line>
[The Closer] <i>So, why did you</i>

<i>sleep with Emily?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<line>
<i>Do you think that part of you was getting</i>

<i>uncomfortable with that closeness?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<line>
<i>You felt like you didn't deserve</i>

<i>Todd's friendship</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
<i>and you wanted to somehow</i>

<i>externalize that feeling into action?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.

Can't it just be that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<line>
When you do bad things,

you have something you can point to

when people eventually leave you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<line>
It's not you, you tell yourself,

it's that bad thing you did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<line>
<i>Do you often keep people at arm's length?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
<i>Are you afraid of being known</i>

<i>and knowing others?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:48" />

<line>
Yeah, you know, I think that you're

definitely hitting on something real

that I would love to drill down into,

but I gotta go

to this marketing meeting now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<line>
Which is so annoying

because I totally want to keep talking

about that thing you're talking about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<line>
But marketing meetings, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<line>
I mean, they're so important.

Can I call you back tomorrow?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<line>
<i>-Of course.</i>

-Great. Bye.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<line>
<i>-So, how was your marketing meeting?</i>

-Weird.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<line>
-Sorry I'm late.

-It's fine. We're just getting started.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<line>
I had the worst morning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
Hanging on every word. Don't tell us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
So I drove here, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<line>
<i>I'm sitting at the entrance to the garage</i>

<i>when I realize I don't have my key card.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<line>
<i>I gotta drive all the way home to get it.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<line>
<i>When I got there,</i>

<i>I couldn't find it anywhere.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>
<i>Suddenly, I remember:</i>

<i>I put it in the glove compartment.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<line>
<i>It was in my car the entire time.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
Because I was driving back and forth

so much, I ran out of gas.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<line>
I pulled into a 76.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<line>
I was about to pump the gas,

I realized I didn't have my credit card,

when I remembered

it was on my desk at home

because I used it to contribute to

my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<line>
Diane...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
Have you donated

to Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<line>
-Oh, shit.

-Throw her 50 bucks. You can afford it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<line>
Yeah, but I don't like feeling

like I have to, Roxy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<line>
Does the world need

a stop-motion short film

about a pig who goes to circus school?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<line>
Think of it like you're doing

a nice thing for your friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
Mmm... okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<line>
<i>I called a cab to take me home</i>

<i>to get my credit card.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
Then back to the gas station, get my car,

fill it up and come here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
So that's why I'm late.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<line>
-Why did you tell us that whole story?

-I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<line>
-Why did you tell me that whole story?

-I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
Anyway, I had the ad agency whip up

some options for the new <i>Secretariat </i>ads.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<line>
Good news is the movie

is killing out there. Everyone loves it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<line>
If everyone loves it,

why do we need a new ad campaign?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
These are

the "For Your Consideration" ads.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<line>
They're a reminder to the Academy,

"Have you considered this yet?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<line>
The Academy doesn't always

consider everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
So they need constant

consideration reminders.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<line>
-That's very considerate.

-This one tested the best.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<line>
That's a good one.

The rest of these suck.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<line>
Dumb. Dumb. Stupid. Offensive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
Ugly. Boring. Typical. Stupid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<line>
Bad. Hideous. Disgusting. Gross. Cliché.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<line>
-I am really good at this.

-Huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<line>
-I kind of like this one.

-How'd that piece of crap get in there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<line>
We ruled that one out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<line>
It's actually really powerful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
[The Closer] <i>What spoke to you</i>

<i>about </i>that <i>particular ad?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<line>
[BoJack] <i>I don't know.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
<i>All the pictures of me,</i>

<i>they looked backwards.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
<i>When I looked at the mirror ad,</i>

<i>I was seeing me as I see myself</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<line>
<i>and I thought</i>

<i>there was something beautiful about that.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<line>
<i>Intimate, almost.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<line>
Of course you like this ad.

When you look at it

you see Secretariat, I see an old turtle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<line>
"Hello, old turtle. Are you Secretariat?

No? You're just some old turtle?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
-What the hell? You've aged terribly."

-But you've got the heart of a champion.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<line>
I got a team of cardiologists at Cedars

who say different.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<line>
Isn't that the point of the movie,

that anybody could be Secretariat?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />

<line>
The point of the movie is to make

a lot of money and win awards.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
If anyone who looks at this ad

is Secretariat,

why should you win the Oscar?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<line>
He's right, BoJack. Why don't you

leave this to the experts, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<line>
-Yes. You're a star.

-[moaning]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<line>
[The Closer]

<i>So, you also had sex with your publicist?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<line>
[BoJack] <i>Yeah, couple times.</i>

<i>We have a very complicated relationship.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<line>
It's complicated.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<line>
If our relationship was a Meryl Streep

movie, it would be <i>Doubt.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<line>
Don't forget, you have <i>Ellen</i> tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<line>
Don't wear that sweater I hate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<line>
Yes. You're in charge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<line>
Okay, you know, I gotta say

I don't feel like I'm in charge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<line>
If you're gonna throw a tantrum,

forget the whole thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<line>
I'm not throwing a tantrum-- Why are we

having sex in my car?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<line>
-Can we at least go back to your place?

-No, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<line>
I don't know where you live.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<line>
You control every part of my life,

I don't know anything about you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<line>
[scoffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<line>
-You don't want to know me, BoJack.

-No, I do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<line>
-I want to be known and know others.

-You don't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<line>
I know you and I know what you want.

This is exactly what you want.

<line>
[The Closer]

<i>What do you think she meant by that?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<line>
Better question:

Why am I still getting the <i>L.A. Gazette?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<line>
Do you think getting the paper every day

is a reminder of Todd's papier-mâché head?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<line>
<i>The project he abandoned</i>

<i>to make time for the old girlfriend</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
<i>you spent an intimate night with?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<line>
Could that be why you want

to cancel your subscription?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<line>
No. I want to cancel my subscription

because newspapers are dumb.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<line>
I feel I'm very clear on this point.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
Every morning,

someone knocks on my door and says,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<line>
"Throw away this garbage for me."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<line>
So you don't feel any guilt

about your tryst with Emily?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<line>
Well, I have had trouble sleeping.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<line>
[Emily and Todd laughing]

[Todd] You're silly.

[Emily] No, you're silly.

<line>
Oh, God.

<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<line>
-Okay, your turn, truth or dare.

-Truth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<line>
What is the worst recent thing you did

to someone who cared about you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
-The worst thing? Or the most recent?

-Both.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<line>
Can you keep it down, please?

Some people are trying to sleep.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<line>
-We are keeping it down.

-We've been really quiet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<line>
-You're basically shouting.

-Sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<line>
-Do you want me to whisper? Like this?

-Yeah, we can be real whispery.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<line>
No, because then I'll hear the

"psst, psst, psst."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<line>
And I'll be up all night

wondering what you're talking about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<line>
-Uh, what would we be talking about?

-Yeah, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
What would we be talking about?

<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<line>
I don't know. Dumb stuff.

<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<line>
Listen, I've been

with guys like you before,

and I know this thing works better

if we keep a little distance.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<line>
And...

[grunting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
-[groaning] Well, that worked.

-Okay, we're done. I'll see you tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<line>
[The Closer]

<i>So, that's how you left things?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<line>
[BoJack] <i>That's how she left things.</i>

<i>But then I followed her home.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<line>
[The Closer]

<i>You did what?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
[BoJack] <i>She lives in this</i>

<i>tiny apartment in the Valley.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<line>
<i>I could see her through the window</i>

<i>and I just watched her being... normal.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<line>
Oh!

[sighing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<line>
[The Closer]

<i>There's something very intimate</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<line>
<i>about watching a person be herself.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<line>
[BoJack] <i>But it wasn't good intimate,</i>

<i>like when you see your mom cry.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<line>
<i>It was bad intimate,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<line>
<i>like when your dad writes a poem</i>

<i>about Lena Horne's nipples,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<line>
<i>makes you read it out loud</i>

<i>so he can hear if it scans.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<line>
[The Closer] <i>She warned you</i>

<i>that you wouldn't want to know her.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<line>
[BoJack] <i>Yeah. She was right.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<line>
<i>It's so sad that when you see someone</i>

<i>as they really are, it ruins them.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
-Do you have someone you can talk to?

-About what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<line>
<i>These feelings you have,</i>

<i>your self-destructive behavior.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
You know that old joke

about how many psychiatrists

does it take to screw in a light bulb?

The answer is just one,

but the light bulb has to want to change?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<line>
-I don't know that joke.

-That's it. That's the whole joke.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<line>
The light bulb has to want to change.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<line>
[laughing]

Yeah. Psychiatrists are idiots.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<line>
<i>That's actually not the point of the joke.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
-Hey. I need to talk to you.

-What the... I'm on the phone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<line>
I got nominated for the Craig Noel Award

from the San Diego Theatre Critics Circle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<line>
Oh, it's too much heat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
I'm taking your boat out

to international waters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
You never saw me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
On the phone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<line>
I don't want to talk to anybody.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
What I want is to have control

over my own life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<line>
[engine starting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<line>
Which is why I'm begging you

to please cancel my delivery

of the <i>L.A. Gazette.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
-I don't think you want to do that.

-I promise you I do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
No, because that's just theater.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
It allows you to think you're in control,

but the whole idea of control is a myth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
The universe is a wild beast.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<line>
<i>You can't tame it.</i>

<i>All you can do is try to live inside it.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<line>
Live inside the beast?

That's a mixed metaphor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<line>
-But... you're right.

<i>-Great.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<line>
I'm going to sign you up

for another six months.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<line>
Since you've been such a sport,

I'm throwing in a tote bag.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<line>
Thanks.

You've given me a lot to think about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<line>
Okay, so I'm a passenger.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<line>
Remember the three D's:

drive safely, drive efficiently,

and don't harass the passenger.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<line>
-Todd, can I talk to you for a second?

-Sure. Driver, pull over, please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<line>
-[imitating car braking]

-[imitating opening door]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<line>
-Can I talk to you alone?

-Of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<line>
Driver, put up the partition, please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
[imitating partition whirring]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<line>
I've been thinking,

and you should do this without me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<line>
What? But the whole point

is we're doing it together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<line>
But you don't need me anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
You have a whole team of coders,

and I don't think that I can work

in this house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<line>
-What's wrong with the house?

-Todd, I just--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<line>
-I need to go.

-[imitating opening door]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<line>
I don't understand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<line>
Did I do something

to make you feel uncomfortable?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<line>
No. You are great. It's me and... BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<line>
BoJack? [sighing]

What did he do this time?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<line>
I don't think

I've been a very good friend to you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
Things happened and...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<line>
I don't think BoJack's been

a very good friend to you either.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<line>
-Oh, okay.

-You should buy me out of the company.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<line>
No, no, no, keep your share.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<line>
Who knows?

It might be worth something someday.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<line>
You're sweet, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<line>
You shouldn't waste that on people

who don't deserve it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
Hey, you want this plum?

I found it in the kitchen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<line>
Sure.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<line>
-[smoke bomb fizzing]

-[both] Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<line>
[coughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<line>
Weird plum.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
[knocking on door]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<line>
How did you know where I live?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<line>
-Ana...

-You need to leave.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<line>
No, I know that it's exciting

to remain mysterious and in control,

but control is a myth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<line>
That's a conclusion

I came to recently by myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<line>
I can't do this now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<line>
I don't want to go home tonight.

I want to sleep in your bed,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<line>
I wanna see what

you look like waking up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />

<line>
You are a beautiful,

sexy, fascinating, terrifying woman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<line>
And I want to know you.

I'm not afraid of that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<line>
And you don't have to be, either.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:44" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<line>
And I want to go with the mirror ads

for <i>Secretariat.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<line>
-BoJack, no, listen.

-Ana.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<line>
This is my campaign,

I know what I'm doing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />

<line>
Call up Turteltaub and tell him

I won't be pushed around on this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<line>
I'm the star and what I say goes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<line>
[cars honking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<line>
[Ana] Hmm...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<line>
[Carolyn] It kind of just looks like

a billboard for the sky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<line>
-I didn't think this part through.

-No kidding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<line>
The sky is Secretariat? The sky

wants you to nominate it for an Oscar?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<line>
It is eerily beautiful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<line>
Like an art piece

that resists interpretation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:17" />

<line>
Oh, good. Yeah. Wouldn't want the ad

for my movie to be interpretable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<line>
If you stand where I'm standing,

you see a reflection

of the KIIS-FM billboard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<line>
Beautiful. So we spent half a million

dollars on an Oscar campaign for KIIS-FM.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
I'd hate to drive here at rush hour.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:30" />

<line>
When the sun goes down

and hits that billboard,

that's gonna--

That's gonna be a real problem.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:36" />

<line>
Well, the good news is

BoJack got what he wanted.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:40" />
