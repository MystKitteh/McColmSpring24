<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<p>
Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<p>
-He'll be here.

-But his part is in 16 bars.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<p>
[grunts and panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
Excuse me. Sorry!

[cheers and applause]

<p>
I heard before he played triangle

he was in a prison gang.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
I heard he was a tech millionaire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
[in French accent] There is a rumor

he is a foreign prince.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
-His name is Todd Chavez.

-[gasping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<p>
And he's the most giving man

the world has ever known.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
He saved my pregnant daughter

from drowning in a shipwreck,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<p>
<i>then he delivered her baby</i>

<i>while they rode on a piece of driftwood.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
-[musicians gasp]

<i>-And then he circumcised her baby</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
<i>while they both hung from the ladder</i>

<i>of the rescue helicopter.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
-[gasps]

<i>-Of course, before he did,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<p>
<i>Todd Chavez explained that circumcision</i>

<i>has somewhat fallen out of vogue.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<p>
<i>They had a spirited</i>

<i>but respectful debate,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<p>
<i>and by the end my daughter decided</i>

<i>that since we are of Jewish heritage,</i>

the boy might like to have the option

to become religious if he so chooses.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<p>
Sounds like he really helped your daughter

make the decision

that was right for her family.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<p>
And last year, when our triangle player

died of starvation

after getting his foot stuck

in his triangle,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<p>
Todd Chavez took over

because we needed him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<p>
-What a guy!

-He is always helping others.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<p>
You know, sometimes

when that triangle part is coming up,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:33" />

<p>
I find myself hoping he won't show up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<p>
No man should be asked

to give that much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<p>
-He is truly the best of all of--

-Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<p>
Oh, hey, guys. I was eating a taco earlier

and I got salsa on my shirt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<p>
I went to clean it off, but then when

I put my hands in the automatic dryer

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:48" />

<p>
I forgot I was still holding the taco.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<p>
I got my hands all greasy,

so I couldn't open the doorknob

for an hour.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<p>
What you guys talking about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:57" />

<p>
[cell phone alarm music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<p>
[Katrina] So then at 11:00 you're gonna be

giving a policy speech on fracking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:59" />

<p>
{\an8}Fracktastic!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<p>
{\an8}Meanwhile, all this talk

of whatever it is you're talking about

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:03" />

<p>
{\an8}-is making me hungry.

-Mmm?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<p>
{\an8}Cheese? Yes, please!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<p>
{\an8}Todd, don't distract Mr. Peanutbutter

with your weird pocket cheeses.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<p>
{\an8}The issue is fracking and the people

really want to know your opinion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<p>
Well, then, color me "the people"

because I would also like

to know my opinion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
{\an8}You don't have one yet.

The polling research comes in today

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<p>
{\an8}and that will decide whether

you're for or against fracking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<p>
{\an8}Here's a thought:

maybe be against fracking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<p>
{\an8}-It's terrible!

-Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<p>
Just my opinion.

You don't tell me how to do my job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
{\an8}Also, fracking is the worst. I can't 

believe you'd even consider endorsing it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
{\an8}None of my business.

Gotta get to work. Love you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<p>
{\an8}-Bye, hon!

-But seriously, seriously,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
{\an8}if you come out in support of fracking

I'm gonna be super upset. Bye!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<p>
{\an8}Where you stand on the issue

doesn't really matter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
What's important is that

you seem sincere and emphatic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
Ohh. Are you a fan of charming

but inessential Will Smith movies?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<p>
Because, slight <i>Hitch,</i>

I always show I'm empathic

by taking off my glasses dramatically,

but I kinda lost them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
{\an8}Wow! This must be what I'd look like

to a starving shipwrecked person.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
[sighs] When did you last see the glasses?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
I was in a meeting with Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<p>
She was saying

I'm always forgetting stuff,

so I whipped off my glasses,

looked her square in the eye and said,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
"I never forget a thing."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<p>
I might have left my glasses there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
{\an8}Todd, you never do anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<p>
{\an8}Why don't you take the campaign bus

over to VIM

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
{\an8}and get Mr. Peanutbutter's glasses?

Can you handle that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<p>
{\an8}I never know if I can handle anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
That's what makes my life so exciting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<p>
{\an8}-[both grunting]

-Mr. Peanutbutter, there's a delivery!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
{\an8}[Katrina] He's busy! Just sign for it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<p>
I can't sign for another man's mail.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<p>
That's how I ended up with the cremains

of Cornelius Vanderbilt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
It all started when a young Todd--

[grunts] I don't have time for this!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
I've got a job to do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
{\an8}[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
-[Princess Carolyn] It's Todd!

-It's me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<p>
You are just the guy I need.

You know the actress Courtney Portnoy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<p>
I think so. She portrayed the formerly 

portly consort in <i>The Seaport Resort</i>?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
Courtly roles like

the formerly portly consort

are Courtney Portnoy's forte,

but she's got a new action movie

that's supposed to change her image:

<i>Ms. Taken.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<p>
You know Mr. Taken

from the <i>Taken </i>movies?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
-This is his niece.

-Nice!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
This was supposed to be Courtney's 

crossover coronation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
But that's sort of been thwarted, 

unfortunately,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<p>
'cause Courtney's

purportedly falling short

of shoring up four-quadrant support.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<p>
Makes perfect sense so far.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
The public sees her as out of touch.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
We need to make her seem relatable,

and the best way to do that

is to be seen dating a down-to-earth

boring nobody like yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
You can do that, right?

You're not doing anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<p>
I'm kind of busy today.

I gotta pick up these glasses,

and then tonight there was this meeting

I wanted to go to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
This will take no time, I promise.

Meet her for lunch.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
The paparazzi will show up,

pop some razzis.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<p>
I do love getting my picture taken.

It's proof I exist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<p>
Marvelous!

Judah, prepare the press release.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
"Portnoy finds joy in hoi polloi boy toy."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<p>
[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
Well, we didn't get the polling research

on fracking--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
-Here you go.

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<p>
Because apparently when the delivery came

someone wouldn't sign for it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
In the future, whenever anyone asks you

to sign Mr. Peanutbutter's name,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<p>
-just sign it.

-You got it, chief.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
All right, Middle-Aged Yeller,

here's what you're gonna do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
You're gonna give

an impassioned speech on fracking

that doesn't actually take a stand

either way on fracking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
Good morning!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<p>
Let's talk fracking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<p>
Everyone has very strong opinions

about it,

and I want you all to know,

right here and right now,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
I am taking a stand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<p>
-I am on... your side!

-[applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
-What side is that, specifically?

-Good question.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
I am specifically

on the side of the facts,

and also on the side of feelings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<p>
-[cheers and applause]

-Well, I'm satisfied.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
Oh, excuse me,

would Mr. Peanutbutter

be willing to sign this letter

to our state government?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<p>
Yes. I'll write his name on anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<p>
Oh, thank you so much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
[gasps] And down goes Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
And up comes Todd!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
Aah! [grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
-Whoa!

-Stay back!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
Calm down, I'm not going to hurt you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
My name is Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim

Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

-Wait, wait, wait.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<p>
-What's your first name?

-Hollyhock.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<p>
And your last name?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson- 

Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<p>
Got it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<p>
-Wait, what's your last name?

-I know, it's confusing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
-I have eight dads.

-How'd that happen? Test tubes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
-No. I was adopted.

-Oh, of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<p>
By eight men in a committed gay

polyamorous relationship.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<p>
-Less of course.

-But ever since I was a baby,

people always said I looked like

BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<p>
-That's a terrible thing to say to a baby!

-[skimmer clatters]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
And I've always wondered if BoJack

could be my biological... sperm guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
I guess it's possible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<p>
BoJack used to say his penis

is like sun-dried tomatoes:

back in the '90s it got into everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
I came to L.A.

to get to the bottom of things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<p>
I even bought a deluxe spy kit.

Sorry about knocking you out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<p>
Once you have chloroform,

you can't <i>not</i> use it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<p>
No, I get it. BoJack had one

of those spy kits, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
He mostly just used the chloroform

on himself, though.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<p>
I read in his book that you live together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
-Can you help me find him?

-Sorry. I don't live there anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<p>
And no one knows where he's been

for the last year.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
I guess I don't have to meet him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<p>
All I need is a DNA sample,

like a piece of hair or something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<p>
-I guess his house might have-- [gasps]

-[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<p>
-Whoa!

-Sorry again. It's just so fun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
Okay, there might be some hairs

in the shower drain,

but hard to know who they belong to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<p>
Everyone who has sex with BoJack

usually takes a <i>long </i>shower afterwards.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
-Hey, I think I see a hair.

-[moaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<p>
Oh, no, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
-Yoink!

-What the... was...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<p>
-[exhales] Okay.

-Okay, let's blow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
Blow? Who's got blow?

Save some for BoJack. [groans] Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
Wait, Todd? Oh, shit. Are you gonna

yell at me? Can I have the blow first?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
No. BoJack, there's no blow, okay?

And I'm not going to yell at you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<p>
And what is this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<p>
I'm Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim- 

Guerrero-Robinson-

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
Of the New Haven 

Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuacks?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<p>
That was a joke. Obviously, I've never

heard of your family and/or law firm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<p>
That was also a joke. Todd, who is

this tough crowd you brought to my home?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<p>
-Um, BoJack, this is your daught...

-Mm-mmm, mm-mmm!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
...dot-dot maid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Way to build up the suspense.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<p>
To, uh, tidy up the place

in case you came back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<p>
You got me a maid? Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<p>
Here I thought Channing Tatum

was a good neighbor

for picking up my mail while I was gone,

but you, and after all the things

I did to you,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
-I don't know how to tell you--

-BoJack, we haven't talked in like a year,

and that's actually been

kind of working for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
So, maybe it's better if we just

keep things like that, you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<p>
-Oh. Okay. So then why did you hire me--

-[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<p>
Oh, yeah, deliver me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<p>
You're welcome.

Now go get that DNA tested.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
[panting]

But I am learning so much

about my possibly-maybe birth father.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

in his closet full of bad reviews

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<p>
So all you've done so far

is snoop around?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
I also ate a box of donuts,

got sleepy and took a nap.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
Yeah, I'm not sure we really need

to do this DNA test.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<p>
Look, I didn't come all this way

to not find out

who my biological father is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<p>
Okay, fine, then I just need you

to yank out a strand of hair

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<p>
-so I can take it down to the lab.

-No way! That sounds painful.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<p>
-Can't we just use your hair?

-Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
-No.

-[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
No, but I can pull out some of my hair

at the same time,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<p>
-so you don't have to do it alone.

-Okay, that sounds fair.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
On three, we pull.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
-One... two... three!

-Ow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
Oh, wait, I have this whole comb

full of hair in my bag.

-Todd, can I see you for a minute?

<p>
This maid is the worst.

I passed out again for some reason.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
When I woke up, the house

was messier than when she started.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
I don't mind someone else

in the house with me,

in case I start choking on pills

or have a funny take on current events

that demands an audience, but if she

can't do her job, I gotta fire her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
You can't do that!

Here, buzz up real nice,

take a nap, and while you're sleeping,

I'll get the maid to clean

so no one has to fire anyone.

Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<p>
[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<p>
-Hollyhock, I need to tell you something.

-Did you get the results?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<p>
'Cause I'm really looking forward

to dropping this whole maid thing,

even though I'm kind of nailing it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
Are you sure you want to know?

I don't know if BoJack is ready

for a normal relationship with anyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<p>
Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
Well, that's fine.

I don't want a relationship.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<p>
I already have eight dads.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
It's not like a ninth dad is what I need

to suddenly fill a hole in my life

that the unconditional love of eight dads

couldn't already fill.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
Well, then good news.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<p>
I got the results and...

it's not a match.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<p>
-Oh. Really?

-Yeah. Good news, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
I shouldn't have come here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<p>
Papa Steve told me this was a bad idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<p>
But Papa Greg said, "Follow your heart."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<p>
Then Papa Dashawn said,

"I agree with Greg."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<p>
Daddy Quackers said,

"Let's put it to a vote, quack-quack."

</p>

-Get down! Go, go, go! Shh.

[Diane] I can hear someone in there.

Uh, it's me... [deep breath]

Channing Tatum.

<p>
I'm in the middle of, uh,

channing right now,

but you can come back... tatum?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
Listen, I'm a reporter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<p>
I tested your DNA

against another sample's DNA,

and apparently the two are related.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<p>
-You're a father.

-Wait, what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<p>
-Okay. Thanks!

-Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
I was going to write a story

and drag your name through the mud

just because I thought a couple more

people would click on an article I wrote.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<p>
But I don't think that's

the kind of journalist I want to be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
Maybe I'm not cut out

for this line of work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<p>
Sorry to bother you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
Uh... [deep breath]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
[in lower voice] Hey, I obviously don't

know you because I am Channing Tatum,

the guy from <i>Green Lantern</i>

or whatever,

and you are a nobody,

but you came all the way over here

to warn me about something

you hadn't even written yet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
You ask me, movie star Channing Tatum,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
I'd say you're exactly the kind

of journalist we need in this world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<p>
Wow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
That doesn't sound at all

like Channing Tatum's voice,

but that <i>is </i>the kind of thing I would want

Channing Tatum to say to me,

so thanks, Channing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
Love half your movies!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
[sighs] That was a close one,

huh, Hollyhock?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
-Hollyhock?

<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
Todd's phone. What do you want?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<p>
So, I see lots of pictures of you

at the fashion show,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<p>
Uh, why are you wearing my clothes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<p>
These aren't anything like your clothes.

This hat alone cost $50,000.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
Oh. So, uh...

what's it like being a movie star?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<p>
It's awfully trying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<p>
Do you ever feel like

everyone's looking at you

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<p>
-but nobody sees you?

-Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
No, I was speaking rhetorically

about a feeling that only movie stars get.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
Ohh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<p>
-Okay.

-But it feels good to talk about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
Yeah. Talking's good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
You know, there was a meeting

I was supposed to go to tonight,

but I don't think I'm gonna go.

I don't know if I'm ready.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<p>
Ready for what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
What if it's not everything

I want it to be?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
Sometimes the idea of something

is better than the truth, you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
I always prefer fiction to truth, 

personally.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<p>
I've staked my career on it.

[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
Yeah, that makes sense.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
-Ha hah!

-Smile for the birdie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<p>
Hey, Courtney, you canoodling

with a supermodel now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<p>
-That's right.

-Fancy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
I love how not down-to-earth

you are together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
This is going to really make headlines

when you two break up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
Here's an even bigger headline:

we shan't be breaking up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
-We're engaged!

-Wowee!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<p>
Hooray! I'm confused!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<p>
Hollyhock? Are you here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<p>
No, but BoJack, who lives here, is here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<p>
BoJack, I gotta tell you, um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
-Hollyhock is your daughter.

-What do you mean?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<p>
-She's your daughter.

-I don't understand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<p>
She has Horseman DNA.

You're her father.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<p>
That's impossible. I'm BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
She didn't want me to tell you,

but I thought you should know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<p>
I guess I don't blame her.

I wouldn't want to be my daughter either.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<p>
BoJack...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
Look what I do to people

I'm supposed to care about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<p>
I had sex with the one person

I've ever seen you be in love with.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<p>
I guess they're not gonna put you

in the best friends hall of fame,

but I don't know that I loved her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<p>
I don't think I'm allowed to be in love.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
Don't say that.

You do so much for everybody.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
All you ever asked for

was a roof over your head

and the occasional s'more in a baguette.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<p>
I'm telling you,

it's a million-dollar idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<p>
I got more of you than I ever deserved.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
If you never talk to me again

I just want you to know

that I appreciate it,

and I appreciate you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
-Thanks.

-[sipping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />

<p>
It was shitty

what you did with Emily, but, um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<p>
I think I'm... asexual.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<p>
A sexual what? Dynamo, deviant?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:44" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<p>
No. Asexual, not sexual.

<p>
Ohh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<p>
-I'm sure you think that's weird.

-Are you kidding? That's amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<p>
Sometimes I wish I was asexual.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<p>
Maybe then I wouldn't have

<i>a </i>strain of herpes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
-You have multiple strains--

-I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<p>
The joke only works with the "a".

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<p>
It actually feels nice

to finally say it out loud.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<p>
I am an asexual person.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<p>
-I am asexual.

-That's great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<p>
So if you're not mad about Emily--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<p>
It wasn't just Emily, BoJack,

and I don't know if I'm ready for us

to be friends again yet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
-Oh. Okay.

-But we can be more than not-friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<p>
You know, for an asexual,

more than not-friends is probably

as good as it gets, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<p>
I'm not really at a place yet

where I want to joke about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:29" />

<p>
-Got it, got it, totally.

-But it feels good to talk about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<p>
Well, if you ever need a place to crash,

that couch--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:34" />

<p>
-I'm gonna go.

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:36" />

<p>
-Right now?

-Welcome back, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:38" />

It's good to see you.
