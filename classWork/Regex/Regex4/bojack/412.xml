<p>
[Princess Carolyn] <i>I got into</i>

<i>this business because I love stories.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:09" />

<p>
They comfort us, they inspire us,

they create a context

for how we experience the world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
But also, you have to be careful,

because if you spend

a lot of time with stories,

you start to believe that life

is just stories, and it's not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<p>
Life is life, and that's so sad,

because there's so little time and...

what are we doing with it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
-[clocks ticking]

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<p>
When Princess Carolyn told me

we were pitching

to whattimeisitrightnow.com,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<p>
I was excited,

because in so many ways,

the story I'm about to tell is about time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<p>
And it's about time this story was told.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<p>
-Ooh!

-Ahh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
[Flip] <i>It's about Detective John Philbert,</i>

<i>a man from another time.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
[Flip] <i>But now he finds himself</i>

<i>in a new time.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
-I'm sorry, did you say newt time?

-No, no, new time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
Oh, so it's not like a time full of newts?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<p>
No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<p>
Unless you want it to be

a time full of newts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<p>
-No, no, no, no. I'm just clarifying.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<p>
He finds himself in a time

he doesn't understand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<p>
-[sighs]

-[phone dialing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
-[man] <i>Don't call this number again.</i>

-Wait. I-- I just--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<p>
My mother, she's senile,

and she was drugging the coffee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<p>
That's why-- Just--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:26" />

<p>
I wanted you to know that

none of this was Hollyhock's fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<p>
[man] <i>Goodbye, BoJack.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<p>
[Flip] <i>A time in which he is alone.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<p>
<i>Perhaps, all this time,</i>

<i>he's been alone.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<p>
-Except for the newts, right?

-Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<p>
Yeah. Except for the newts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<p>
{\an8}[theme music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:39" />

<p>
And then it dawns on him,

his partner isn't a ghost.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<p>
Or is he?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:44" />

<p>
{\an8}-Wow!

-As we like to say here,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:47" />

<p>
{\an8}there are little hand ideas

and big hand ideas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<p>
{\an8}And that's a big hand idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<p>
And you said BoJack Horseman

is attached?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<p>
{\an8}What? Oh, yeah.

BoJack is attached.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<p>
{\an8}But he's not like "attached" attached.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<p>
{\an8}If you want us

to get somebody better--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<p>
Oh, no, no, no.

We love BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<p>
{\an8}Yeah. We don't wanna do this

without BoJack, just to be clear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<p>
{\an8}-Well--

-Oh, he's definitely attached.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:08" />

<p>
{\an8}He signed a contract. I saw it myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<p>
{\an8}Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.

[gulps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<p>
{\an8}So if you look to the left, you'll see

a charming little breakfast nook.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<p>
{\an8}-Oh!

-[gasps] Look at that!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<p>
{\an8}But if you want more natural light,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<p>
{\an8}you could knock down that wall

and put in these...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<p>
-French doors!

-That is so cool!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<p>
-You actually don't have to yell.

-Wait, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
Are we in the same house right now?

I don't see you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
I can hear you.

I think we're close!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
You can't see each other

in the program.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
{\an8}So I'm invisible?

Oh, in this scenario, am I a ghost?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
{\an8}Of a Union soldier, perhaps,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<p>
{\an8}who cannot rest until

his final letter is delivered!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
And can I be

Anne of Green Gables?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
No, you're both still you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
Diane, can I talk to you alone

for a moment?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
-Oh, I can step out--

-Sure!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<p>
Why don't you meet me

in the guest bathroom? Ow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
-You don't have to.

-Where's--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
{\an8}-Hold on. I think--

-Guys, I can just--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
-Here we are.

-Diane?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<p>
No. Careful. Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
-Do you really love this house?

-Yeah, it's fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
I didn't love the old house,

but it was your house and I moved in,

and it was great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
{\an8}But this is an opportunity

to build something together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
{\an8}Something that'll last

for the rest of our lives.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
{\an8}Anything you want is gonna be good

with me. Just like your old house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<p>
{\an8}But I don't want this to just be

another one of <i>my</i> houses.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<p>
{\an8}I want this to be <i>our</i> house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<p>
And it will be,

because we'll both be living in it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

I don't need anything fancy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
All that matters to me

is that I get to live with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<p>
-In the real world.

-Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<p>
No more campaign,

no more ex-wives.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
Just Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter,

back to normal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<p>
-For the rest of our lives.

-That sounds great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<p>
-We'll take it.

-One second, though,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<p>
-I have to use the bathroom.

-No, no, no, that's not--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<p>
<i>You completely humiliated me</i>

<i>in front of Sha Na Na!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<p>
[The Horse]

<i>How was I supposed to Sha Na know</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<p>
<i>they were going to invite me</i>

<i>on the stage to do a guitar solo?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
[Sabrina]

<i>You're supposed to be my dad.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
<i>You're supposed to be</i>

<i>looking out for me.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
[Sabrina]

<i>You're the worst dad in the world!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
[The Horse] <i>Well, too bad</i>

<i>I'm the only dad you got.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
[Sabrina grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<p>
-[doorbell chimes]

-[both] <i>Huh?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<p>
[The Horse] <i>O.J. Simpson lawyer</i>

<i>and DNA expert Barry Scheck?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
-[Scheck] <i>My car broke down.</i>

-[Sabrina] <i>What?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
[Scheck] <i>I guess it ran out of... juice.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
Hi. Yeah, my mom is a resident.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
I've still got a bunch of her stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<p>
Don't put me on hold.

Just take a message--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<p>
[Sabrina] <i>Wait, wait!</i>

<i>You're a DNA expert?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
<i>Could I use DNA</i>

<i>to find my real family?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<p>
[Scheck] <i>Well, sometimes,</i>

<i>DNA can be a tricky thing.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<p>
<i>Like, for example,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<p>
<i>was Simpson DNA found at the scene</i>

<i>of the murder of Nicole Brown?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
<i>Sure. Was it O.J. Simpson's DNA?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
-<i>Who's to say?</i>

<i>-Oh.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<p>
<i>Maybe it was some other Simpson,</i>

<i>like his son, or his father.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<p>
<i>There's no way to know.</i>

<i>I wouldn't worry about it.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
<i>That's too much, man--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
[doorbell chimes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
-Oh.

-Hey, buddy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
-Uh-oh.

-She had a long day... of drinking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<p>
I figured she shouldn't

drive herself home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
-Good thinking.

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<p>
I was right too,

because she crashed her car.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<p>
I probably should've

said something, but...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<p>
You need to get your shit together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
Wha-- Where am I?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
Okay, so you know how you're always

giving pep talks to people,

telling them they need

to get their shit together?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<p>
Well, this is me giving you

the Princess Carolyn pep talk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
-Why am I tied up in the woods?

-So you can't escape my wise words.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
Is that not part of it?

I couldn't remember.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
It doesn't matter.

It's all over for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
When it gets out

I faked BoJack's signature,

the deal's gonna fall apart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<p>
There goes my reputation, my career--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<p>
Well, there's more to life

than just your career, isn't there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
-Is there?

-Isn't there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
I have nothing!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
Oh! This pep talk is going

in the wrong direction.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
Do you know how hard it is

to start a family at my age?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
-To find a guy at my age?

-You don't need a guy to start a family.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<p>
You're Princess Carolyn.

You can do anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
No, I can't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
Look, the woods are dark and scary,

but the only way out is through.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<p>
I'm sorry.

I got distracted by the woods.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<p>
-Um, what were we talking about?

-No, you're right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
The only way out is through.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
I gotta talk to BoJack.

I gotta stop feeling sorry for myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<p>
I'm Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<p>
That's the spirit!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<p>
As my blood type always says,

"B" positive!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<p>
-What was that?

-I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
-Oh!

-Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<p>
-Hey, Doctor Picarello.

-[groaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<p>
Doctor Picarello, are you okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<p>
-[growling]

-Todd?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
-[all snarling]

-[drill whirring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
So it turns out Vice Chancellor

Laughing Gassy got rabies

from quarrelling with an old raccoon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
And then he started biting everyone,

and now a bunch of them have rabies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
Who could have predicted

my innocent clown dentist venture

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<p>
-could turn into something so terrifying?

-I don't see how this concerns me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<p>
Yolanda, the only reason

they're in the woods at all

is because of you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<p>
If people find out the Better

Business Bureau is behind this,

you don't think you'll be getting a buzz

from the Business Branch

of the Board of Better Bureaus?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
You're right! We have to do something

before someone gets hurt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<p>
Call me four out of five dentists,

because I agree.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
Here we are.

The rest of our lives.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<p>
Yeah, wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<p>
-Do you wanna go to Hawaii?

-What? Right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
Yeah! When's the last time

we did something impulsive?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
Well, you did run for governor

without giving it much--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<p>
I just think we could use a vacation.

Things have been so crazy this last year.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
Before we start the rest of our lives,

haven't we earned a break?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<p>
All right. Let's go to Hawaii! They got

that bridge that's just sitting there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
-We might as well use it.

-All right! Hawaii, here we come!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<p>
-All right! Hawaii!

-Hawaii!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
-[horns honking]

-[Diane] Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<p>
-[Mr. Peanutbutter sighs]

-[gulls squawking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
So, listen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<p>
As you know, one of the differences

between agents and managers--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<p>
-Oh, my God. Stop. Please stop.

-I'm producing a new TV show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
It's a phenomenal script which may

or may not involve ghost or newts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<p>
-Does it involve ghost or newts?

-It may!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
-You haven't read it, have you?

-Read it? I'm producing it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
-Right.

-It's this gritty, hard-boiled mystery--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<p>
-Ugh! I'm so sick of mysteries.

-Right, well--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
They're impossible to figure out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Then all of a sudden, some random detail

makes the hero remember a conversation

that totally re-contextualizes everything,

and then it all magically comes together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<p>
-Sure, but--

-It's such bullshit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
Where's my random detail that's gonna

suddenly make everything make sense?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
Because I would love that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
Well, this script is really special,

and everyone wants to play the lead,

from Matthew McConaughey

to Matthew Perry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
-Matthew Perry?

-Yeah. But I was thinking--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<p>
Hold on. Matthew Perry...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<p>
Hey, BoJack, which one

of these pictures more says,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<p>
"This daughter looks like a cool lady

that I wanna have in my life"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<p>
Why do you ask?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
I'm writing a letter to my mom

and I want to include a picture.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<p>
I'm going to send it

to the adoption agency.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
Maybe if they still have her address

on file, they can forward it to her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<p>
Seems like a long shot. How about

a better strategy is, don't do that,

and then you won't be disappointed

when it doesn't work out?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
I'm trying everything.

I don't wanna look back at this

and feel like the end

of "Chandler's List," you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<p>
-You mean <i>Schindler's List</i>.

-Never saw it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
I'm talking about "Chandler's List,"

the sketch from when Matthew Perry

hosted <i>SNL.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<p>
-Remind me?

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<p>
So it's Chandler from <i>Friends,</i>

and it's World War II,

and he's got this list.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
And the whole time, he's like,

"I'm Chandler!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<p>
Could I <i>have</i> a bigger list?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
But then at the end, the war's over,

and he's like...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
-"Could I have had a bigger list?"

-Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<p>
He's haunted because he feels

like he could have done more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
You know, he's like,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
"Could I <i>be</i> any more feeling

like I could have done more?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
I have to go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
Look, I'm trying to do you a favor here!

[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<p>
[door slams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
Oh. [gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<p>
-[snarling]

-[music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
Shh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<p>
Yes. Get the magazine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<p>
What a fine addition

to your waiting room.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
-Oh, no!

-[drill whirrs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<p>
[music playing at faster tempo]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
-[screaming]

-[drill whirring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<p>
[grunting, groaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
-Oh, God.

-[clown growling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<p>
What are we gonna do, Todd?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
-Guys, let's talk this out.

-[drill whirring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
[horn honking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<p>
Run. Ouchie! Ouchie!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<p>
[both panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
-Oh, man.

-I've never run that fast in my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
-Me neither.

-I gotta get in better shape.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<p>
I keep saying I'm gonna run more,

but it's just so hard to stay motivated.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<p>
Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<p>
Don't "hmm." I'm talking to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
-[horns honking]

-[tires screeching]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
-Can you not start and stop so much?

-I can't control the traffic, darling.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
When the car in front of me starts,

I start. And when it stops, I stop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<p>
Maybe you don't have to start

every time the car in front of you starts,

because you know it's gonna

stop again anyway.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
-You could leave a little space.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
-[engine rumbles]

-And another car just cut in front of me

because I left a little space.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm getting carsick.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<p>
Okay. I'm gonna get some gas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<p>
All right. I got the lowdown.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<p>
First of all, very important,

I got you this flattened penny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
I will cherish it always.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<p>
-I'm sorry for being annoying before.

-Don't worry about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<p>
Here's the deal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
With this traffic,

we can stay on our current trajectory

and get to Hawaii just in time

to spend two luxurious hours

at the Honolulu Stilton,

and then turn around and come back,

or we can hang out here

at the Thrifty Lodge

at this charming halfway to Hawaii

rest area and gas park.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<p>
Excuse me,

we would like your finest room, please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<p>
-All our rooms are the same.

-What kind of cuisine is on premises?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
There's a deli at the gas station

across the street.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
-And what are your spa hours?

-There's no spa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<p>
Okay, if I wanted to have a big gala,

could I use your grand ballroom for that,

or is that booked months in advance?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
I could settle for a demi-ballroom

in a pinch,

but attire will be formal,

I don't wanna upstage the venue.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
We have zero ballrooms

in this Thrifty Lodge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
I see. This will do nicely.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<p>
Didn't you tell me once

you always wanted a ballroom?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<p>
Actually, no. [chuckles]

What I wanted was a Belle-room.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
What is that? Like a room full of bells?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<p>
It's a room full of big books,

with big windows and a ladder,

like Belle got in <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
-And it's called a Belle-room?

-It's called a library.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<p>
But I called it a Belle-room

because it was magical.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<p>
And since it was a name I made up

for a room that wasn't real,

that meant that it was just mine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<p>
That's adora-Belle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<p>
-[woman] Hey, Seaborn! Seaborn!

-What's that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
You're Seaborn's Seahorse Milk, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<p>
Ha! That's right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<p>
Oh, man! Can I get a shellfie?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
That's like a shellfish version

of a selfie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<p>
-Hmm?

-Go, take a picture.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<p>
It'll make their day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
-You sure? You don't mind?

-I'll be in the room.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<p>
Don't stay out

with your new friends too late.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
Hey, guys. I'm coming down.

What other of my things do you like?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
[man] Wow, yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<p>
Okay, so...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<p>
[snoring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<p>
Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<p>
Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<p>
[Jose] So the supplier said,

"I really oughta give Iowa a try."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<p>
But I said, "Buddy, Kansas City's

about as far as I can go."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<p>
Long story short,

we're meeting in St. Louis.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<p>
-[pounding on door]

-Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<p>
-Hey!

-I need to talk to Hollyhock!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
-She's not here.

-You have to let me see her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<p>
Please, I flew all the way here

and it's Wichita,

so it's not like

I got other shit to do in Wichita.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<p>
No one told you to come here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<p>
You're the one

who likes foreign movies, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
That part in <i>Amelie,</i>

where she listens to the guy's story?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

<p>
This is that part.

And I'm the guy with the story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
And I need you to be Amelie right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
I don't like foreign movies.

I like foreign <i>films.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<p>
Okay, you're impossible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<p>
The rest of you, please,

just listen for a second.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<p>
I know you hate me.

But for Hollyhock, please, listen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<p>
[clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<p>
Whole time she's staying with me,

it doesn't make sense, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<p>
If I'm her father,

where is her mother?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<p>
Well, that's an extremely

heteronormative way

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<p>
-of looking at things.

-No, I'm saying, medically,

where is the woman I had sex with

that made her be born?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<p>
Right? That's why Hollyhock

came to L.A. in the first place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
Okay...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
But then I thought,

"What if I'm not her father?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<p>
You're not her father.

<i>We </i>are her fathers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<p>
You're her fathers. Yeah. I know, I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
Eight of you, each have

your own cute thing, I get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<p>
My point is, Hollyhock and I

have the same DNA,

but that doesn't mean I'm her father.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
You're not.

Because being a father isn't just--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<p>
God, I feel like you are

willfully misunderstanding me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
What I am saying is,

I'm not even her father biologically.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<p>
-Excuse me?

-My father is her father.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<p>
-What?

-Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<p>
[BoJack] <i>I went to every hospital</i>

<i>and clerk house in L.A.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
<i>I waited in lines, filled out forms,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
<i>I wouldn't rest until I knew</i>

<i>I'd done everything I could.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<p>

<p>
<i>born on Hollyhock's birthday...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<p>
Okay, so?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<p>
...in L.A., because Hollyhock

wasn't born in L.A.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
She was born in San Francisco.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
<i>I got a little bug in my brain</i>

<i>that my father knocked up the help.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<p>
-That's--

-But where is she now, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
<i>Looked her up on Facebook.</i>

<i>I know what you think:</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
<i>"BoJack Horseman</i>

<i>has a Facebook account?"</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<p>
<i>Obviously, I didn't,</i>

<i>because the Internet is for nerds.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<p>
<i>But I know it's a good way to find people,</i>

<i>so I set up an account, and I found her.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<p>
<i>She lives in Minneapolis.</i>

<i>She's a nurse.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<p>
<i>Her phone number</i>

<i>was on her Facebook page.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
And I wanted Hollyhock to have it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<p>
-You did all that?

-She has to know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<p>
You don't have to tell her I was here.

I'll stay out of her life forever.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<p>
You can tell her I'm an asshole.

Say you found this on your own.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<p>
I don't care, but you have

to tell her. Please.

Nothing motivates like fear.

</p>

<p>
So remember, once you're in there,

don't stop running.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<p>
If the clown dentists catch you,

they will bite you,

and they have very healthy teeth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<p>
[chuckles] Okay, but not really, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<p>
Nope, really. They will actually bite you,

and they do actually have rabies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<p>
Wow, guess I'm gonna

really have to run.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<p>
No more excuses. This is great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
Exactly! And don't forget...

have fun in there!

</p>

-[man] Let's do this.

<p>
-[man 2] Let's go.

-[all screaming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<p>
Well, you did it.

You made a better business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<p>
<i>We </i>did it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<p>
Between your no-nonsense approach

and my the-regular-amount-of-nonsense

approach,

we make a pretty good team.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<p>
Yes. I'm going back to my job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
But if anything happens here

and you need me,

or if you just wanna hang out again,

grab a drink,

you should call me sometime.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<p>
Oh, um, I should tell you,

I'm actually asexual.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<p>
Yeah, I know. So am I.

That's why I'm asking you out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<p>
-Oh! Uh, okay.

-Okay. Goodbye.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
Huh.

-I have to talk to you.

-Make yourself at home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<p>
I screwed up. I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<p>
I promised you'd do this show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<p>
I don't know why. I just...

I needed something--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
-I'll do it.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
You want me to do it, I'll do it.

God knows you've done enough for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
-[groans]

-What's wrong? I said I'd do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
It's just really hard to need people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
Yeah, but...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
Yeah. Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
Eh, it'll be good for me

to get out of the house anyway.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
You want a drink?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<p>
-Water.

-Water? "Water" you pregnant?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
[chuckles] Very much not so.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<p>
-I heard you got a new boyfriend.

-We broke up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<p>
Oh. Sounds like an asshole.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
He was actually the first guy I ever dated

who wasn't an asshole.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<p>
-Well, onwards and upwards.

-I heard you had a kid living with you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<p>
No. She's got these adopted dads.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
They're total dicks,

but they take care of her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
-She'll have a good life.

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
-You ever think of adopting?

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<p>
-More and more lately.

-You should. You'd be a good mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<p>
-The world needs good moms.

-I'll take that under advisement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
Well, I guess I'll see you on set.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<p>
I'm looking forward to it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
Now, back to normal.

Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<p>
-Here we are. The rest of our lives.

-I wanna show you something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
I had the contractor put this together

while we were gone. Close your eyes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
-[Diane] Okay...

-All right. Open them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
-Oh, my God! It's--

-Pretty cool, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
-Why would you do this?

-It's what you always wanted, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<p>
It's too much. I didn't want it like this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
-Like what?

-I don't know. I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
This is great. I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<p>
Why would you think I would like this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
Because you told me

this is what you always dreamed of?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
I don't like big gestures like this!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
-How many times have I--?

-Yeah, but this is--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
This was a fantasy,

something that belonged to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<p>
Why couldn't you have asked me--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:09" />

<p>
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever try

to surprise you, or do nice things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<p>
Do you know how much it cost

to get 5,000 fake books?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
-So I'm the bitch? Is that what you--

-I'm sorry that I wanted to make our home

feel like a place

that you would want to live

that could be yours as well as mine!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
Why is that so important to you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
Because otherwise,

it feels like you're a guest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
And unlike the talking candlestick

in the aforementioned Disney film,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<p>
I don't want you to be that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
It makes me feel shitty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<p>
Like you're just visiting here,

until the next thing

and you're gonna leave me

when you get bored

or you find something better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
Like Katrina did. Like Jessica did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<p>
You can't use your ex-wives against me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
I'm just telling you how I feel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<p>
I was trying to do a nice thing for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
This is not how I thought

this would go at all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.

Back to normal, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<p>
You know, sometimes I feel like

our marriage is like a magic eye poster.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
-I love those things.

-I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
And it's messy. And at first glance,

it doesn't seem to make any sense.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<p>
And it's hard to figure out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
But sometimes,

if you squint at it just right,

everything lines up,

and it's the most perfect...

beautiful, amazing thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<p>
Yeah. I know what you mean.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
But...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
[voice breaks] I'm so tired of squinting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<p>
[crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<p>
Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<p>
-Oh, Christ.

-[ringtone chiming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
-Hollyhock.

-Hi.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
<i>-How are you?</i>

-Listen...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
I wanted to thank you

for finding my mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
-They told you?

-Not exactly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
They have this secret dad language

they think I don't understand,

but it's super obvious

what they're saying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
[chuckles] You're too smart

for your own good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<p>
So, yeah, I've been talking

to Henrietta on the phone

and she seems really nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<p>
Really? Wow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
I'm gonna visit her in Minneapolis.

I'm at the airport right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<p>
Right now? That's incredible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<p>
No, what's incredible

is this place at the airport

charged me ten dollars

for a cup of fruit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<p>
<i>-What?</i>

-And get this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<p>
<i>It's like 90 percent honeydew.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<p>
Are you kidding me? Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<p>
What on-the-go jet-setter's demanding

more honeydew in his or her fruit cup?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<p>
Nobody ever wants honeydew,

it's always there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<p>
It is literally the worst part

of everything it's in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />

<p>
It's like the Jared Leto of fruits.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<p>
Thank you. Exactly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<p>
Mmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<p>
Well...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
Anyway,

they're about to start boarding, so...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
Hollyhock, I'm sorry

I didn't take better care of you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<p>
I shouldn't have moved in with you.

It was maybe too much too fast.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<p>
-Yeah.

<i>-But it wasn't all bad.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />

<p>
I mean, yeah,

I got secretly drugged for months on end

to the point I was living a nightmare

in which I couldn't recognize my own body

or understand what was happening

to my brain, but,

other than that,

it was a pretty chill experience.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<p>
I should have protected you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<p>
I really wanted to be

a good dad to you, Hollyhock.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<p>
Well, turns out you're not my dad at all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<p>
Yeah. Good thing, I guess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:11" />

<p>
Yeah. Good thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<p>
So, uh, Minneapolis, huh?

Did you rent a car or a cab?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:19" />

<p>
BoJack, it's all taken care of.

I gotta go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<p>
Is there anything, uh, I can do?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<p>
I can upgrade your seats, or...

or send you better fruit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<p>
BoJack, look,

I never needed you to be a dad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:30" />

<p>
I'm going to be fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<p>
<i>I told you from the beginning,</i>

<i>I have eight dads.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:33" />

<p>
Yeah. Yeah. Good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:37" />

<p>
But... I've never had a brother.
