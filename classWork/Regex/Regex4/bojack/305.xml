- Hey, buddy, big day.

- [moans] No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<line>
- Big premiere day.

- Stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<line>
<i>Secretariat </i>in theaters now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
- How exciting.

- Please stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<line>
People are seeing your movie,

forming opinions, judging you,

all over the country.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<line>
- What are you doing?

- Or not. Maybe nobody's seeing it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<line>
Wouldn't it be weird

if literally nobody saw your movie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
How do I get out of this conversation?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<line>
Just think: by this time tomorrow,

we'll know if it's a hit or a flop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<line>
The air crackles with possibilities.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<line>
- Oh, good lord. [groaning]

- Uh-oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<line>
It's all over. My career is gone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<line>
I'm sure it's going to be fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<line>
Wasn't <i>Secretariat </i>a big hit

at the Pacific Ocean Film Festival?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<line>
Critics called it,

"Gurgle glub glub blub blub."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<line>
Festivals don't matter, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<line>
It's so you can get some leaves

on your poster.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<line>
But this is the real world now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<line>
If this doesn't hit big this weekend--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
- It's-- Oh! Oh, God. [gasps]

- Oh, no!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<line>
BoJack, it's gonna be okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<line>
- [phone ringing]

- [gasps and moans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<line>
BoJack, the East Coast box office is in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<line>
<i>Secretariat </i>is, wait for it...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<line>
- a huge success!

- Why would you make me wait for it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<line>
That was a terrible time

for a "wait for it."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<line>
Do you know what this means?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<line>
You're no longer just some TV actor

they threw into a movie,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<line>
<i>you're a bona fide movie...</i>

<i>wait for it, star.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<line>
BoJack, how do you feel?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<line>
Awesome.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:33" />

<line>
[funky electronic music]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<line>
<i>♪♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:28" />

<line>
We defy odds,

we face challenges with valor,

and we never give in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<line>
For those reasons, and many more,

our love is like the team

that inspired the movie <i>Cool Runnings.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:42" />

<line>
If I may borrow

that film's promotional tag line,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<line>
"Jamaican Bobsledders?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:47" />

<line>
That's right, Diane.

"Jamaican bobsledders."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<line>
{\an8}Thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<line>
{\an8}Thank <i>you,</i> Dr. Janet,

for Jamaican me open up like that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<line>
{\an8}That took up most of the hour,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<line>
{\an8}but we do still have a little time

to hear from Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<line>
{\an8}Mr. Peanutbutter, I think you are great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<line>
{\an8}- Is that all?

- I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm not always good at using words

to describe emotions.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<line>
{\an8}Aren't you a writer?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:14" />

<line>
{\an8}Writer/social media coordinator/

director of New Media Outreach.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<line>
{\an8}- [alarm blaring]

- Aah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<line>
{\an8}That gentle sound tells us the sun has set

on our time together this week.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<line>
{\an8}But I remind you

of the importance of communication.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<line>
{\an8}It's the very blade of the bobsled.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm not singling out either one of you,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<line>
{\an8}but I think for the next time,

some people here

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<line>
{\an8}might want to work on putting

their thoughts and feelings into words,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<line>
{\an8}as a writer does.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<line>
{\an8}- Mmm?

- Mm-mmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<line>
{\an8}- Ah.

- [sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<line>
I settled on a company dental plan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
It's called, "The tooth, the whole tooth,

and nothing but the tooth."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
- Seemed comprehensive.

- Not "tooth" shabby, Judah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<line>
- [laughing]

- Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<line>
I also wanted to talk to you,

if this is a good time,

and it is, because you have exactly

nine minutes before your meeting

on <i>Captain Hooker 2:</i>

<i>Yo Ho Ho Ho and A Bottle Of Booty.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<line>
Yeah, what's up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<line>
I've taken on duties beyond the scope

of my original contract.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<line>
- I think I've proven my worth.

- Are you asking for a raise?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
A more elegant solution might involve

an ownership position in the company.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<line>
I thought I'd ask for 15 percent stake,

you'd counter with five,

we'd settle on ten.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<line>
- Well, then, it's settled.

- I'll draw up the paperwork.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<line>
Speaking of paper,

Piper Perabo and Pauley Perrette

need to push back the pitch on

the <i>Princess and the Pauper </i>project.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<line>
- You have a night off tonight.

- A night off?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<line>
- When's the last time that happened?

- It hasn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<line>
- Can I help you with anything else?

- Get me a date for tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<line>
Make that three dates.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
Who knows when I'll get another night off?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<line>
I do. And you won't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<line>
Excuse me, my good man.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
My movie, starring me,

the movie star, just opened.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<line>
We'd like to sit at the bar.

Drinks on the house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
Of course, Mr. Horseman.

Right away, Mr. Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<line>
[clears throat]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<line>
Mr. Sutherland, I'm going to have

to ask you to give up your seat

for a movie star and his companion.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
- Yeah. Beat it, Kiefer.

- [scoffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
Wow!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<line>
- They love you here.

- Everybody loves a movie star, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
I'm gonna get a lot of love.

I want you by my side,

soaking up the spillover

and feasting on my discarded leftovers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<line>
Sounds great, Boj.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<line>
Tonight, we're riding

a rocket straight into the sun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<line>
You won't get left on the launchpad

just because nobody knows your name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
- Todd? Todd Chavez?

- I think you mean BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<line>
- BoJack Horseman.

- Emily.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<line>
No, BoJack. Why do people keep

saying names that aren't my name?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
I haven't seen you since high school.

You look great. I love the hat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<line>
Thanks. What brings you here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
My dumb best friend's getting married,

so I'm here for the rehearsal dinner.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<line>
Why is everybody not talking about me

for a moment? This is concerning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<line>
- Oh, my God. You're BoJack Horseman.

- Yeah, duh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
I loved <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

That is, like, my favorite show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<line>
- You mean <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

- No, <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<line>
It was so dumb. It was the best.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<line>
- Thank you?

- I mean, it was the worst.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
- But that's what made it so good.

- Yeah, I got it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
I was laughing at it

because it was so bad, do you understand?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
- You're being very clear.

- I feel like I'm not articulating.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<line>
My enjoyment didn't come

from a place of sincere admiration.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<line>
It was more like,

"What an ill-conceived television show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<line>
Who made those terrible choices?

I can't stop watching."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<line>
You don't have to keep--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<line>
Anyway, I'm pretty much in love with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<line>
Thanks. I love you.

By which I mean, you're terrible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<line>
I should get back

to this stupid rehearsal dinner.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<line>
Todd, it was really great to see you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<line>
Wait, did you say there's a wedding?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<line>
- I said "rehearsal dinner," but--

- Whoa! We gotta crash that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
Boring regular people love it

when movie stars show up

and drink their alcohol.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<line>
They jizz their pants for that shit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<line>
- I don't know, BoJack.

- I'm sorry, Todd. Are you a movie star?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<line>
I did narrate a Mazda commercial.

Funny story how that came together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<line>
This is not the time for one

of your weird stories that go nowhere.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<line>
- We've got a wedding to crash.

- It's a rehearsal dinner.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
It just doesn't come easy for me,

like it does for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<line>
Communication is a process.

That's why we're going to Dr. Janet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<line>
- That, and there was a Groupon.

- You had a model growing up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
You had a house filled with love,

parents who said nice things to you,

and the beautiful verdant hillsides

of the Labrador Peninsula.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<line>
I didn't have Diane Peninsula.

I had the Isthmus of Assholes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<line>
I keep telling you

we should go visit the old country.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<line>
You'd love it up there.

There's so much to smell.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<line>
[chuckles] That's weird.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
I just got a text from Alexi Brosefino.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
The famous movie star and man about town?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<line>
He wants me to come to his house

and party with his friends.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<line>
The Snatch Batch?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<line>
Alexi Brosefino wants <i>you </i>to party

with the Snatch Batch?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<line>
He's one of our clients.

I met him a couple weeks ago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<line>
We talked about me

Instagramming one of his parties.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<line>
I didn't think he actually wanted me

to do it tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<line>
Oh, wait. Tonight?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
I hoped we could snuggle up

on the couch and watch <i>Bones.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<line>
I don't think that show's about

what you think it's about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<line>
Besides, I have to go.

It's for work. I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
It's fine. But you'll call me

if you're out late, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<line>
- Yes. I'll call you.

- Okay. Have a good time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
Ugh! I'm sure I won't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<line>
Cool guys like that

take me back to high school

and I end up feeling

like a huge nerd over again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
The only kind of nerd you should feel like

is hon-nerd that he selected you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn, I made reservations

for you tonight at Elefante.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<line>
- Reservations?

- For your dates.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
One at seven,

one at 8:30, and one at ten.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
You actually got me three dates?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<line>
- I was joking.

- I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<line>
I sometimes have trouble reading tone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<line>
Once I spent 45 minutes

at a fascinating lecture

at the Apollo Theater

before I realized it was a comedy routine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:29" />

<line>
I can't go on three dates.

Can we reschedule two of them?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<line>
It will be a long time

before you get another night off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<line>
Especially since you have those lawyers

coming next week to change light bulbs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<line>
Okay, I just realized now

that was also a joke.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
As the father of one of the brides,

I just wanted to take a moment to--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<line>
<i>Buenas noches, amigos.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<line>
Let's get blasted. Right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<line>
Oh, my God, BoJack Horseman.

The movie star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
This is the happiest day of my life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<line>
- [cheering]

- [hip-hop music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
- Ooh.

- [doorbell rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<line>
- Can I help you?

- I'm Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<line>
- Um...

- I work for Princess Carolyn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<line>
You texted me to come hang out

with you and your friends.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<line>
- I'm running out of things to say.

- Oh, yeah. Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<line>
Yeah, no, of course. Come in, please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<line>
- Holy shit. Is that a Klimt?

- Hey, guys, we got a guest.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<line>
Diane, this is Carlos, David,

and Shitshow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<line>
- Yo.

- Word.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<line>
Ah, the famous Snatch Batch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<line>
That's just a dumb name

some reporter came up with.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
We don't actually call ourselves that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<line>
We all have sex with a lot of women.

But who cares?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
We also love getting brunch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<line>
You might as well call us

the Brunch Batch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<line>
Or the Brunch Bunch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
Oh, my God, Carlos,

that's why you're the funny one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<line>
That is really good.

Write that one down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<line>
Yeah, we get why the Casanova narrative

is appealing and how it helps our brand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<line>
- We're not complete idiots.

- Yeah, except for Shitshow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<line>
- [blows raspberry]

- [laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<line>
Good one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<line>
But within each man

lives a great multiplicity, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<line>
- Nobody is just one thing.

- Yeah, except for Shitshow, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<line>
- [nervous chuckle]

- Ah...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<line>
You know, we can make fun of him

because, like, he's our friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>
I am so sorry, Shitshow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<line>
But the modern era of automotive glass

began when engineers

took two panes of laminated glass

and separated them

with a thin layer of PVB.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<line>
- Uh-huh.

- How about you? Are you in the industry?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<line>
- Yes, actually. I'm an agent.

- Agent?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
Oh, you're in the entertainment industry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<line>
When I said the industry,

I meant the auto glass industry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<line>
We call our business the industry

because we think

we're more important than everybody else.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
[whistles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<line>
I could bore everyone to death

about how proud I am

of the woman Taneisha's become,

but rather than read the remarks

I've been preparing

for the last eight months,

I'm gonna turn the microphone over

to an honest to God movie star,

BoJack Horseman, ladies and gentlemen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
[cheers and applause]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<line>
Thank you, thank you.

Let's get to the reason we're here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
And no, Uncle George,

I don't mean the chocolate fountain.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<line>
[laughter]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<line>
You know, I don't know

Karen and Taneisha super well,

but I do know how precious and rare it is

to find that one missing puzzle piece

who completes you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<line>
And when you know, you know.

You know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
So congrats to the happy couple

for knowing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
Okay, as they say in the movie business,

"That's a wrap on BoJack."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<line>
Let's hear it

from some of these bridesmaids.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<line>
Taneisha, Karen.

[sing-song] Taneisha... Karen...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
On the way here, the driver stopped

in some weird parking lot

and asked if he could touch my hair.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<line>
- That's terrifying.

- I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<line>
It is a very popular ride-sharing app,

you'd think they could vet

their drivers better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<line>
Which app is that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<line>
I probably shouldn't say,

for legal reasons.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
I think we all know

which one I'm talking about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<line>
You know what would solve

a lot of problems?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
If there was a ride-share app for women

that only had women drivers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
That is such a good idea, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<line>
- You always did have such great ideas.

- You know what else would be cool?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<line>
A miniature cupcake gun,

so you could shoot tiny cupcakes

into your mouth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
"Uh-oh! Is that guy

trying to kill himself?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<line>
"Nope, just a cupcake gun."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<line>
Wait, no, go back to your other idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<line>
- Which one?

- The one about the women drivers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<line>
Taneisha, and Karen.

[sobbing] Karen and Taneisha.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<line>
[dance music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
And my foundation focuses

on clean water initiatives

and that's actually how I met Carlos.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<line>
He patented a process

for ionic remineralization.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<line>
- It's crazy.

- That's incredible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
Okay, enough shop talk. Let's roll.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<line>
- Diane?

- Oh, drug taking. That's cool. I'm cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<line>
- What is this, Molly?

- [laughter]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<line>
Yeah, Diane, some drug dealer from 2013

found a time machine

and gave us this Molly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
- Nobody does Molly anymore.

- This is Gush.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<line>
What's Gush?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
[chuckles] Look, Diane, I get that

this is maybe not your usual scene.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<line>
- So don't feel like you have to do any--

- No, no, I can hang. Let's do drugs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<line>
Let's put the drug in my mouth,

so I can trip or roll or gush or--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<line>
- [gulping]

- Oh, you all did it. Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
Here we go.

Oh, it doesn't hit right away, does it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<line>
- No, it'll take a few minutes.

- Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<line>
So how'd you guys meet Shitshow?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />

<line>
We went to his TED Talk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<line>
Oh, it is so great

to finally date a woman my age.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<line>
- Yes.

- Who's comfortable in her own skin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<line>
I always say, there's more than one way

for a cat... you know, to have skin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<line>
And has come to terms

with not having children.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<line>
What makes you think

I don't want to have children?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<line>
Oh, come on.

What are you, serious? At your age?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<line>
Since when are you an expert

on who can and cannot have children?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<line>
I'm a gynecologist.

I specialize in fertility.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<line>
I'd be happy to put you in the stirrups,

look at the old cat eggs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<line>
Ecch! Not if you were the last albino

rhino gyno on the planet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<line>
I'm the only albino rhino gyno I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<line>
- Should we get some wine?

- Oh, great. You're also a wine addict.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<line>
Oh, yeah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<line>
So to do a soft launch,

I think we'd only need about ten cars.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<line>
I could work out any bugs with the app.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<line>
You really know what you're talking about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<line>
So, do you think

your girlfriend would get jealous

if we started this project together, or...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<line>
Oh, God, this is so embarrassing for you,

but I actually don't have a girlfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:38" />

<line>
That's a really weird assumption

for you to make.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<line>
You look really dumb right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<line>
No, actually, I was kind of hoping

you weren't seeing anybody.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<line>
I'm also not seeing anybody,

for what it's worth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<line>
- Ohh.

- Hey, Todd, you must be a real cool dude

if a movie star wants to hang out

with you for no reason.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<line>
Just wanted to give you

a key to the room I booked,

which nobody is in right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<line>
- Winkity dinkity.

- BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<line>
Maybe you two

should just go see if the bed works.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
A lot of these rooms have faulty beds.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<line>
- That's a great idea.

- Uh, yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<line>
Okay, let me just finish

this cocktail real quick. [slurping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<line>
- Uh...

- All right, Todd. Yeah, go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<line>
Ahh! Cool, I'm just gonna get

one or two more drinks

and then we'll go check out that bed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<line>
[Emily] Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />

<line>
Um... hello, everybody. I was thinking

about what BoJack said before.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<line>
About how when you know, you know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<line>
And I'm sitting there,

and I'm thinking, "Do I know?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<line>
- Uh...

- I mean, I think I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<line>
But if you know when you know

and I only think that I know,

maybe that means that I don't know, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<line>
- Oh, boy.

- Karen, I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<line>
I love you, but I can't do this.

The wedding's off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
[gasping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
- [Emily] It's a rehearsal dinner.

- Thank you, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<line>
- [mic feedback]

- [sobbing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<line>
Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<line>
I don't think it's working.

Am I doing this wrong?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<line>
Am I doing drugs wrong?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<line>
Alexi, did you hear back

from that piece you texted?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<line>
- Mm-mmm! Mm-mmm.

- "That piece"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<line>
That girl was hot.

What was her name again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<line>
Doesn't matter.

I mean, let's just enjoy ourselves, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<line>
- Diane?

- What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<line>
No, the hot girl. Her name was Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<line>
You saved her in your phone

as Cool Sexy Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<line>
Let's just, like, drop it, now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<line>
That's funny.

You have two friends named Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<line>
You know, I also know Diane Lane.

So, there's that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<line>
Why are we talking about other Dianes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<line>
Hey, wouldn't it be funny

if you tried to text Cool Sexy Diane,

but then instead you texted

Regular Boring Diane by mistake?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<line>
And then I showed up

and you were like, "Who's this chick?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<line>
All night, I'd be hanging out with you,

thinking I was one of the gang,

but it was just a big mistake

because you meant to text--

Oh, shit, that's exactly what happened.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<line>
Wait, Diane, please hear me out...

[voice deepens and distorts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<line>
Whoa.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<line>
[laughter, distorted]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<line>
Oh, shit. It's hitting. I gotta go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<line>
[panting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />

<line>
- Diane, wait. Come on.

- I get it, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<line>
You're the cool kids. I'm the nerd.

I should have known.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<line>
So I texted the wrong person. So what?

This isn't high school.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<line>
There's no nerds and no cool kids.

We're all adults.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<line>
We're hanging out together

and having a good time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:17" />

<line>
- So just come back inside.

- Everyone knows I don't belong there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<line>
Hey, you belong

wherever you want to belong, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<line>
- Yeah?

- Yeah, look at me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<line>
I'm a handsome white guy

and I never feel like I don't belong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
Also, you took a shit ton of gush.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<line>
- Things are about to get insane.

- I just took one pill.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<line>
Yeah, that's a shit ton.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<line>
- My jeans feel amazing right now.

- That is great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<line>
I feel so much love.

I got to tell someone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<line>
Yes, yes, tell me.

I'm in this with you, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<line>
No. I got to go home.

I got to tell my husband.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<line>
- [sighs]

- Wait, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<line>
That tree is amazing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<line>
Ugh! [shudders]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<line>
- Princess Carolyn?

- You've got to be kidding me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<line>
- You're a cat.

- And you're a mouse.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<line>
- I think I know how this ends.

- [both chuckling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<line>
Let's not waste each other's time

and cut right to the chase.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<line>
- It was nice to meet you, uh...?

- Ralph Stilton. It was nice to meet you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<line>
May all your disasters

be this easy to avoid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
[chuckling]

If I have one more bad date...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<line>
Oh! I am right there with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<line>
Date canceled.

I could use a bite to eat, though.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<line>
There's this great place

around the corner.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<line>
It's a little hole in the wall,

but they do a nice cheese plate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<line>
Hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<line>
- [sobbing and sniffling]

- [howling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<line>
Wow. Weird turn of events, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
Nobody's fault, right?

I'm gonna jet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<line>
You need to talk some sense

into my daughter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<line>
Yeah, talking sense into people

isn't really my thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<line>
In fact, I'm better at the opposite.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
I once got Nic Cage to buy

Charlie Chaplin's mustache on eBay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<line>
That was his last ten bucks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<line>
Please, BoJack. She'll listen to you.

Everyone loves the movie star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<line>
Uh... hey, laundry cart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<line>
Want to hide in sheets

and pretend we're ghosts?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
No, Todd, I don't want to pretend

like we're ghosts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<line>
I want to go in the hotel room

and fool around. Do you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<line>
[chuckles] I don't know, Emily.

Uh, you're pretty drunk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<line>
No, I'm-- I'm not. I'm not drunk at all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
- Oh, well, I'm pretty drunk.

- Yeah, but it seems like you're--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<line>
Maybe I should just go to bed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<line>
- I'm, uh, I'm feeling kind of sick.

- Oh, yeah. Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<line>
But, hey, it was really great seeing you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<line>
- Yeah, it was great seeing you too.

- Yeah, yeah, good night.

<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<line>
What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<line>
[laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<line>
My arm is stuck in the trap

and I'm running around the kitchen

like crazy, smearing blood everywhere.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<line>
- Oh, this is me.

- [alarm chirps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<line>
I think as far as disasters go,

that was one of the better ones.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<line>
It's the best non-date I've ever had.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<line>
Yeah, I was thinking,

maybe some time we should have a--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
- What's the opposite of a non-date?

- A date.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<line>
- That's the word.

- I'd like that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<line>
Well, great, great.

[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<line>
When can I see you again?

When's your next night off?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<line>
Did I say something? Is it because

I asked for the glass of milk?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<line>
- If you give me a cookie--

- No, you're great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<line>
It's just running an agency

doesn't give me a lot of nights off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<line>
Tell you what, here's my card.

If you're ever free, give me a call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<line>
If not, I'll just meet somebody else

and invite you to the wedding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
- Oh, thanks.

- You don't have to come, but send a gift.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<line>
- Hey, Taneisha?

- [sniffling] BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<line>
- I was thinking about what you said--

- Stop doing that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<line>
Nobody should be thinking

about the things I say.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<line>
- I love Karen. But does she complete me?

- Taneisha, nobody completes anybody.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<line>
That's not a real thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<line>
If you're lucky enough to find someone

you can halfway tolerate,

sink your nails in and don't let go,

no matter what.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<line>
- So, what, I should just settle?

- Yes, thank you, exactly. Settle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<line>
Because otherwise you're just gonna

get older, and harder, and more alone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<line>
And you're gonna do everything you can

to fill that hole, with friends,

and your career, and meaningless sex,

but the hole doesn't get filled.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<line>
One day, you're gonna look around

and you're going to realize

that everybody loves you,

but nobody likes you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<line>
And that is the loneliest feeling

in the world.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
[door latch clicks]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<line>
- The wedding is back on.

- [cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
I love you, baby. I always knew I did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<line>
- This is the happiest day of my life.

- Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

[giggling] Bones.

[panting] Mr. Peabut Nutter.

Mr. Peeper Number.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<line>
- Diane? Are you okay?

- [shushing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<line>
The drugs have something to say.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
And even though they are drugs,

they come from science,

so let's give a listen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<line>
I know I don't always have

the right words,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<line>
I don't always have the right feelings,

but I love you so much

and I need you to know that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<line>
Yeah, I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<line>
And sometimes I think that I know myself,

but maybe that's a trap.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<line>
Because maybe I <i>am </i>Cool Sexy Diane,

or Really In Touch

With Her Feelings Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<line>
Or possibly other Dianes

we don't even know about yet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
The point is, I'm all of the Dianes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<line>
I know exactly what you're talking about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<line>
I love that you do crazy things

that make no sense,

like fill our house up

with spaghetti strainers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
I had a very good reason for that,

but I do not remember what it was.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<line>
And we're really good for each other.

Or at least, you're good for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<line>
And you're fun. And you're sweet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<line>
And I love you. And I need you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<line>
And I don't always know

how to tell you that. But drugs help.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<line>
That's right, honey. Drugs are great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<line>
And now, I'm going to carry my man to bed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
- Here we go.

- Oh, okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<line>
- [grunting and straining]

- Uh, is this a good idea?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<line>
The drugs want me to do this,

and that means it's a good idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<line>
- Aaah! [grunts]

- Ohh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
Ow!

Drugs, I thought we were friends.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<line>
- Why were you working in the dark?

- Oh, I guess it got dark.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<line>
- I didn't notice. How were your dates?

- [sighs] Pointless.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<line>
Yes, most dates are.

Well, I've prepared our agreement.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
- Look it over, sign it at your leisure.

- I don't have any leisure.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<line>
While you're signing, I have a stack

of holiday cards for the staff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<line>
I took the liberty of writing

little personal messages

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<line>
- to everyone on your behalf.

- Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />

<line>
- Hey.

- Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<line>
- What's gonna happen tomorrow?

- I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<line>
- Are we going to fight?

- No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<line>
We are. Drugs are gonna wear off

and I'm gonna be mean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<line>
- Why am I so mean?

- You're not mean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:11" />

<line>
[exhales]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:13" />

<line>
[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<line>
- Let's go to the Labrador Peninsula.

- Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<line>
- Spend New Year's with your family.

- Oh, you are gonna love it up there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:20" />

<line>
I have an uncle who still plays the flute

at the local pub every week.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:23" />

<line>
- I want to hear him.

- Ohh, you can't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<line>
- He plays in dog frequency.

- Aww.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
Well, your blood work looks good.

So go home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<line>
Oh, and, uh, lay off the drugs.

Especially now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:34" />

<line>
- Why especially now?

- Oh, don't worry. Your baby's fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:39" />

<line>
What do you mean "baby"?

Why do you say "baby"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:41" />

<line>
Do you not know?

<timestamp data-time="00:24:44" />
