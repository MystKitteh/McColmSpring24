Come on, guys. Pay attention.

The squib didn't fire.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
-What did I do?

-Not you. Squib. Squib.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<line>
-The squib.

-I don't need any help. Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<line>
-You're doing great, BoJack.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<line>
And I did a great job watching you,

which is most of what producing is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<line>
We're doing it, buddy! First day!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<line>
Listen, I still have some questions

about my character,

and the script, and the show,

and you asking me to do this show,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
-and me saying, "Yes".

-Hey, can we get rid of Philbert's watch?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<line>
The network doesn't want us

to remind the audience

about the existence of clocks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<line>
And why we're making a TV show

for What-Time-Is-It-Right-Now-dot-com,

which is a website for people

who don't know their computers

already have built-in clocks

at the corner of the screen?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<line>
All your questions will be answered.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

But in the meantime,

would it kill you to smile?

Just like a bitch to shoot me

in the heart, bitch.

Good thing I carry this flask

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

[director] And, cut.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<line>
Hey, Flip. Can I ask why I'm calling

her a bitch twice?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<line>
The first bitch is her.

The second bitch is your heart.

</line>

about my character.

[beeping]

<line>
-I have two minutes.

-Okay, well, my first question is--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:59" />

<line>
{\an8}-BoJack Horseman...

-Oh, jeez. Here we go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<line>
{\an8}...and Mr. Peanutbutter

on the same studio backlot?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:04" />

<line>
-One sec--

-What is this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<line>
-A mismatched buddy comedy...

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<line>
...about two guys

from different sides of the tracks

who learn to respect each other

because they have a common interest?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<line>
-Who's this guy?

-Ignore him. Why--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
And a grudging respect

blossoms into real friendship

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<line>
{\an8}as they set aside their differences

to achieve a shared goal...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<line>
{\an8}-Stop it.

-...each bringing their own strength

to the table,

and possibly there's a karaoke scene?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<line>
Why does John Philbert's house

look the same as my house?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<line>
I've never been to your house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<line>
The set was designed to reflect

Detective Philbert.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<line>
Spare, lonely, precariously balanced

on a hill of his own isolation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<line>
It kind of looks

like David Boreanaz's house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<line>
{\an8}The set designer

actually took a tour there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, that's very interesting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<line>
Why are you here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<line>
I'm playing Julius Caesar

on the stage next door, in a movie!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
Well, it's a short film.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
-I gotta run.

-Wait!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<line>
I'll see you next time

I'm <i>Roman</i> around the lot!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<line>
{\an8}-Flip, when can we talk?

-Tomorrow morning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<line>
{\an8}-Hi.

-Hey.

</line>

<line>
{\an8}-[exhales]

-Wow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
{\an8}Sorry, I can't do you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm too distracted, I'd just do a bad job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
{\an8}You know your own body better than me

anyway so just go to town.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<line>
{\an8}Yeah, I'm gonna go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<line>
{\an8}Wait, Gina.

Can I ask you a question, about you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<line>
{\an8}Uh-huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
{\an8}Do you think I'm right, and

the Philbert character is poorly written,

and Flip needs to write him better,

so I don't look so bad?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<line>
Look, I do one of these shows every year.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
And I keep getting hired

because I show up, do the work,

and keep my head down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
But do you love this script?

Do you love your character?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<line>
{\an8}Do I love Internal Affairs Director

Sassy Malone,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<line>
{\an8}whose primary character traits

are that she hates bras

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<line>
{\an8}and loves cold rooms?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<line>
{\an8}Not especially.

It feels gratuitous and male-gazey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<line>
{\an8}But it pays for my expensive habit

of having a mortgage

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
{\an8}-in Southern California.

-You don't have to go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<line>
We could hang out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<line>
I'm sure you don't wanna be all alone

in a house by yourself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
{\an8}No, I love being alone.

I wish I were alone right now.

[Hollyhock grunts] <i>BoJack? Why are you up?</i>

<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
I could ask you the same question.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<line>
Now you're in college

you don't need to sleep anymore?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<line>
Oh, right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<line>
I wanted you to know

that I hearted your Instagram photo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<line>
Okay, cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<line>
Well, there were 23 other hearts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<line>
But I don't know if you know

who they're all from, but one was from me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
Yeah, they let me know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
Oh, cool, cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
Okay, I'm going back to sleep.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
Fine, but this phone call does not replace

our weekly Sunday call. Okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
Yeah, I'll talk to you Sunday afternoon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
Yes. Good. Because I miss you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<line>
Sorry, that sounded dumb.

I don't miss you, I'm just bored.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
-That also sounded dumb.

Good morning, lovebugs!

<line>
Don't mind me, just passing through!

Not sneaking a peek at the lovebugs!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<line>
There's nothing to see

that would embarrass any of us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
-We are all fully clothed.

-Ha-ha. If you say so!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<line>
What are you gonna do

while I'm at work all day?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<line>
There's an old frog

who lives down in the L.A. River.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<line>
He owes me an egg salad sandwich,

on account of a caper we once went on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
-What?

-I was gonna see if he wants

to make instruments out of shoeboxes

and rubber bands.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<line>
And, uh, that will satisfy you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<line>
When your life is ends,

and you're looking back at this day,

you'll think that was a good day?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<line>
Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<line>
Well, from your preliminary paperwork

you seem like a perfect candidate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<line>
Thanks, I just never thought

it would be like this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<line>
I mean, my mom popped out kids

by the dozen. And I can't even--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<line>
Mnh-mnh. Princess Carolyn,

is your name Cutie Cutie Cupcake?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<line>
-No, that's--

-Were you born on August 12th, 1947?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
-I--

-Do you sleep with your hands stuffed

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
-in lotion-filled socks?

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<line>
Right, because you are not your mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<line>
-How did you know--

-What you are is noble,

honorable, and unimpeachable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<line>
Anyone can just have a baby.

But to adopt one? That takes a hero.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
It takes a selfless, giving,

kickass superwoman

who's willing to take out

her checkbook right now

and write the adoption agency

a check for $60,000.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<line>
Well. [sighs] Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<line>
Fabulous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<line>
I'm just so glad

that I'm on this journey with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn,

I'm with you every step of the way,

from you giving me this check

all the way to me introducing you

to your new caseworker, Tracy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
-Hey.

-Ah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
You're in wonderful hands, bye!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<line>
Uh, what--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
Congratulations. What are you,

like, five months pregnant?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<line>
No, I'm not a birth mother. I'm adopting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
Oh, that makes sense.

'Cause you're so old.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<line>
Is Mikhaela ever coming back?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<line>
-[scoffs] Yeah, in your dreams.

-[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
Yes. Yes. No. Yes. What?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<line>
Jeanine, the script

calls for hot and haunted.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<line>
Does this girl look hot

and haunted to you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<line>
Yeah, I'm sure she was hot

for <i>Shakespeare in the Park,</i>

but I need TV hot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<line>
-Actually, she's starting to look haunted.

-[door opens]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
-Hey! Uh, this a bad time?

-It's fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<line>
I can talk to you and also judge

these women's bodies at the same time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<line>
What do you want?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
Okay, well, first of all,

the script is great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<line>
Really top-notch stuff.

I love the whole... thing of it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<line>
I just wanted to clarify some things

about Philbert as a character.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<line>
Yeah, okay, on page three,

is it necessary that Philbert

can only orgasm if he's listening

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<line>
-to a recording of his dead wife's voice?

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<line>
Okay, well, what about this thing

on page eight

where he goes to a strip club and just

sits in the back with a sketch-pad

and draws the strippers,

while a Leonard Cohen song plays?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<line>
What about it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<line>
It's just that

all of these half-naked women.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<line>
I mean, I understand it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
I'm just worried it might come across

as gratuitous and, uh, male-gazey,

which I know it isn't!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
Hmm. You know what? You girls can go home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<line>
The stripper scene's cut.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<line>
-No.

-Seriously?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
-Uh, oh. Uh...

-How am I gonna feed my baby?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<line>
I just got an idea for something better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<line>
So, instead of drawing strippers naked,

you're just going to draw Gina naked.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<line>
[BoJack] Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<line>
Gina, BoJack was concerned the old scene

was gratuitous and male-gazey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<line>
Oh, he was? BoJack said that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<line>
[Flip] This is much more interesting

and motivated by character.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
And since it's motivated by character,

that means it's not gratuitous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<line>
Thank you for the note, BoJack,

you really helped.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
Yeah. Thanks, BoJack, for helping.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<line>
-Oh, um...

-[Flip] Can we get some ice?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<line>
Can we get some nipple ice for Gina?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<line>
-So, you're the famous Yolanda.

-I am not famous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
You might have me confused

with another more famous Yolanda.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<line>
I know, I-I just meant

because Todd talks about you so much,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<line>
I feel like you're famous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<line>
Oh, well, that was not clear.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
Okay. Todd, why don't you say things now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<line>
Steve, you still fixing up your truck?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
You're thinking of Emily's old boyfriend,

firefighter Steve D'Marco.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<line>
Yeah, I'm firefighter Steve D'Mazio.

We're very different.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>
But I do have a truck,

and I'm fixing it up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:16" />

<line>
So, thanks for asking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<line>
I created a dating app

for firefighters to meet me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<line>
-Looks like it worked.

-[chuckles] Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<line>
Hey! We should create a dating app

for asexuals.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<line>
Why would asexuals want a dating app?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<line>
Well, not all asexuals are aromantic.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<line>
-Uh...

-Think of it this way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<line>
One could be: A, Romantic,

or B, Aromantic,

while also being A, Sexual, or B, Asexual.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
So you could be BB, or BA.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
As for me, see AB, see?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<line>
So, even within the one percent

of the population that's asexual,

there's an even smaller percentage

that is still looking

for romantic companionship.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<line>
Seems like a pretty thin user base

for an app.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<line>
But without it, asexual romantics

might end up settling for just whatever

other asexual romantics they might meet,

even if they have nothing else in common.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
-Well, anyway--

-Yeah, but maybe it's good

if they have nothing in common

because then they can help each other grow

and change, and become fuller,

more well-rounded people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
Yeah, that's true.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
So, Todd, are you still doing

that rabid clown-dentist exercise thing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<line>
Oh, no, that whole thing kinda fell apart

when the clowns got loose.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<line>
[mystery music]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<line>
Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
<i>I know you killed your wife, Philbert,</i>

<i>and I'm gonna prove it.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
[Mr. Peanutbutter] Wow!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<line>
<i>Don't finger me for a murderer, Malone.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<line>
<i>I don't know</i>

<i>where those fingers have been.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
[Mr. Peanutbutter] Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<line>
Well, how about I show you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<line>
-[Mr. Peanutbutter] Wow!

-[Flip] Cut!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<line>
Someone keeps shouting "Wow" and "Ooh."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<line>
You guys are doing a bang-up job

over here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<line>
So sayeth Caesar! King of the apes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<line>
Look, man, I know what you're doing, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<line>
You're trying to punish me.

Just don't punish Gina.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<line>
I'm not trying to punish anyone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<line>
I'm just trying to make a good show

that's brilliant and unprecedented.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
It sounds like you guys

are basically on the same page.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<line>
You're the only one with a problem here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
-Gina is fine with it.

-Gina is not fine with it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<line>
You guys, you're almost saying

exactly the same thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<line>
Except one of you is saying "not".

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<line>
Gina, do you have a problem

with the nudity in this scene?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<line>
It's great. It's brilliant, unprecedented.

I'm gonna get some potatoes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
You see? Everyone's fine with it but you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
So, can we drop it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<line>
I know you're used to being

the most important person on set.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
-This is not about me.

-It's weird for you

that I don't need to listen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
-I'm not--

-Hey, hey--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>
But if you actually have notes

that are helpful,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<line>
I would love to hear them when

you're done swinging your dick around.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<line>
-No, this is not about my dick.

-Okay, fellas...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<line>
-Well, maybe it should be about your dick.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<line>
Since you're so concerned

about the male gaze,

let's give the females

something to gaze at.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<line>
We'll do a full-frontal nude scene

with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<line>
This is compromise!

This is working together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
-Well, hold on.

-Fully exposed, Philbert reaches up

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<line>
-with both hands to screw in a light bulb.

-Yes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<line>
He totters in little circles

on a tiny stool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<line>
-Wouldn't I just turn my wrist?

-Full body rotation. We see everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<line>
Now we're talking!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
-No, we're not! Princess--

-I'm on it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<line>
Flip, BoJack can only do this scene

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<line>
-if he can wear a T-shirt.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
He's very self-conscious

about his belly area.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<line>
No, I'm self-conscious

about my penis area.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<line>
He can't wear a shirt.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<line>
It's about being vulnerable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<line>
We see every fold and imperfection

of his wrinkled, saggy body.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<line>
-Hey!

-So we like him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<line>
But he has to be fully erect

so we respect him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<line>
-What?

-We'll shoot it tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<line>
-Yeah.

-Unless you don't like this idea,

in which case, we can go back

to what we were doing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
-Right.

-Well--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />

<line>
So, you would be admitting

that you don't actually care

about the male gaze

and you were only giving me notes

to hear yourself talk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<line>
But that's not it, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<line>
-Right.

-Great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<line>
-Shooting is tomorrow afternoon.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<line>
-I'll send the waxing kit over tonight.

-Philbert waxes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<line>
Not for cosmetic purposes.

He just wants to feel something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<line>
-[chuckles]

-Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<line>
I like your friend.

It's impressive how she creates companies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<line>
And her boyfriend has

an interesting career as well.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<line>
Yeah! And you have an interesting career.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<line>
Hey! The three of you

all have interesting careers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<line>
That is so cool!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<line>
Todd, do you ever feel weird

that you have

no discernible life direction?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<line>
-No.

-Let me rephrase that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<line>
I feel weird that you have

no discernible life direction.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<line>
-Oh.

-I mean...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<line>
-What am I supposed to tell people?

-A story? A joke?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<line>
Compliments are things

people like being told sometimes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<line>
I'm sorry. How was your day?

Did you end up meeting with that frog?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<line>
No, I just stayed home

and looked at stuff on the Internet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<line>
-[gasps]

-Hello, Princess Carolyn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<line>
You're not Princess Carolyn.

Why are you not Princess Carolyn?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<line>
-She gets home pretty late.

-I came all this way for nothing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<line>
I brought my spinny chair

and everything!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<line>
Well, if you want something to do,

you could help me find a job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
-You're looking for a job?

-I spent all day looking!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<line>
First, I thought

I should get a newspaper to find one,

but then I was, like,

"Where do I find a newspaper?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<line>
-Uh.

-So, I looked it up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<line>
And a map came up of my local area.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<line>
So, then I thought about

how I know this area pretty well,

but there's all kinds of areas

I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<line>
-Like South Africa.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
-And then I thought about Charlize Theron.

-Uh, right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<line>
And then I thought about

that movie <i>Monster.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<line>
And then I was, like,

"What year did that come out?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<line>
-So I went to Monster.com...

-[pc clacking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<line>
...to look up facts

about the movie <i>Monster,</i>

and it turns out

they have job postings there!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<line>
-[Bojack sups]

-What a time to be alive!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
Hey! A posting for

WhatTimeIsItRightNow.com!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<line>
[Todd] Oh, a janitor job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<line>
I've always wanted to... Janet!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<line>
I just got an amazing idea.

Interview for that job!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<line>
Uh... Was that your amazing idea?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<line>
Because I feel, like,

it kinda came out of the room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<line>
When you get in the building,

say you need to use the WC.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<line>
Then you'll sneak into the office

of one of the network execs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<line>
Go into their email

and send a message to Flip McVicker

telling him he can't film

any more nude scenes

because they're derivative

and unnecessary,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<line>
-especially the nude scenes involving me.

-You are throwing a lotta words at me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<line>
Todd, don't you get it?

We're gonna save the show!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<line>
You're on a show?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<line>
This is a very impressive resume.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<line>
Yep. Now, if you'll excuse me,

I must adjourn to the restroom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<line>
You founded a ride-share app.

You built and managed your own theme park.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<line>
And you were, briefly,

Governor of California!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<line>
I was also the director

of a <i>Star Wars</i> movie,

but they fired me

over "creative differences."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<line>
Now about that restroom...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<line>
Hold on. You are way overqualified

to be a janitor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<line>
-Okay. But I do actually need to go.

-Oh, you need to go, all right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<line>
-Straight to the top of this company!

-[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<line>
We're ready for you on set, Mr. Horseman.

<line>
Just a minute.

<line>
Bad news is I can't help you.

<line>
Why not? You're their boss now.

You can tell them what to do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<line>
I could, but I'm no leader at all

if I can't delegate authority.

Can we get it even bigger?

<line>
Ugh, Todd, your good-hearted naiveté

has once again conspired

with outrageous happenstance

to completely dick me over!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<line>
Have you tried just talking

to the show runner?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<line>
In my experience,

I've found it's best to shoot straight,

in the boardroom and on the driving range.

<line>
-I never do!

-[cell phone beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<line>
-Hey, Flip, we need to talk.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<line>
-I'm not doing the naked scene.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<line>
The only reason you wrote it

is to embarrass me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<line>
BoJack, I'm not writing scenes

for my television show

and also directing them

in order to teach you lessons

or send you secret messages.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<line>
I'm just trying to make a good show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<line>
-Why do you keep making it so difficult?

-I'm making it difficult?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<line>
I have done nothing,

but be a friend to you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<line>
I actually called my mom last night

and told her that I made a friend on set.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<line>
Do you wanna make me a liar to my mother?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<line>
-What? Ew. Weird.

-Take off that robe and go to set.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<line>
-No.

-Take off that robe right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<line>
Why can't you act like a professional

and get naked?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<line>
Because it's dumb!

This whole show is duuuuuuumb!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<line>
It's confusing, it's overwritten,

and it's poorly lit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<line>
The darkness is a metaphor for darkness!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<line>
And worst of all, it's boring!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<line>
It has nothing to say,

and it says that nothing badly!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<line>
[inhales] Let me tell you

how this is going to be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<line>
I am the show creator

and if I want your character to get naked,

he gets naked.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
If I want him to speak only in Korean,

you're learning Korean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<line>
If I want your character to shit his pants

and walk around with shit in his pants

for the rest of the season,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<line>
-you will do just that.

-[mystery music]

</line>

-You signed a contract.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
And that means I am your god.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<line>
You will please your god,

and if I don't see your ass on set

then I will see your ass in court.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<line>
Do you understand?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<line>
That's a good note about the lighting.

I'll take a look at that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<line>
Good news! We found a birth mother!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
Really? A-already?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<line>
She came in yesterday.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
She's giving her baby

to a sweet couple in Illinois.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<line>
-What?

-Oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<line>
Did you think we found

a birth mother for you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<line>
Conceited much?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<line>
Tracy, I’m spending a lot of money

to be here with you

and I'm putting myself

in a very vulnerable position.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<line>
Is there any way

you can be a little more thoughtful

with the way you manage me as a client?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
It sounds like what you're looking for

is an adoption manager.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<line>
This is an adoption agency.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<line>
-Do you not know the difference?

-[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<line>
-[cell phone buzzes]

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn, I overplayed my hand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<line>
BoJack and I got into a fight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<line>
-And he never showed up on set.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
-[horn blaring]

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<line>
[BoJack] Princess Carolyyyyyyyn,

I need to talk to youuuuuu.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<line>
-BoJack.

-Hold on, I got a thing with a chair.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<line>
How did you even find me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<line>
Duh. Bought a burner phone,

slipped it into your purse,

and then used the Find My Phone app.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<line>
How thoughtful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<line>
[deep voice] Hello, Princess Carolyn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<line>
Oh, God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<line>
I have a plan and I need your help.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<line>
-I found out his mom has a fake leg.

-Who's mom?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<line>
Flip. I'm gonna seduce her, steal her leg,

and then smack him across the face with it

until he chokes on his own blood.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
It's subtle,

but I think he'll get the message.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<line>
BoJack, what are you trying

to accomplish here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<line>
I-I don't want to do the show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
So you're gonna run away

like you always do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<line>
Yeah. I never wanted to do this show!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<line>
-You faked my signature!

-And I told you that,

and you said, "Okay" because you wanted

to be a good friend to me!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<line>
So, you can't get points for that

and then resent me for it now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<line>
-It's not about you! I don't like him!

-Oh, Flip's not that bad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<line>
He's just insecure

and is overcompensating a little.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<line>
I know that must be

a foreign concept for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
No, not Flip. Philbert.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<line>
He-he's a drunk.

He's an asshole. I don't want to be him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<line>
So, maybe don't be the drunk asshole.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
Maybe this time, you have a good attitude

and you don't drink so much

and you show up at your call time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<line>
And then you put on the Philbert costume

and you <i>pretend </i>to be this other guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<line>
And then when you're done shooting,

you take off your costume

and you're BoJack, the star of the show

that everybody likes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<line>
-Yeah?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
Hey, why are we at an adoption agency?

Are you adopting something?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
-I'm trying to.

-Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<line>
So, can you keep it together

for the next ten weeks

so I don't need to come to set,

every day, to put out fires?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<line>
You think you could do that? For me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<line>

<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<line>
[Flip] Action.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<line>
[Diane] Hey, stranger.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<line>
It sounds like you had an amazing trip.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<line>
I did. What have you been up to?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<line>
Well, I did play Julius Caesar

in a pizza commercial

that they're going to... [chuckles]

...get this, show in movie theaters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
Wow, look at you. Pizza.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
<i>Et Cru-Dités?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<line>
-What?

-That was my line.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<line>
I played Little Caesar's dad, Big Caesar,

in the back story part of the commercial,

which is funny because most commercials

don't even have a back story part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
Also, Little Caesar's

doesn't sell crudités.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<line>
Oh, man, my part's definitely going

to get cut, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<line>
Just like the real Caesar!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<line>
Hey, that's right!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
-Well, here's your place.

-[horns honking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<line>
Yep. Here it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<line>
Well, anyway, I signed the papers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<line>
Oh. Great!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<line>
Yeah, so if it all looks good to you

and your lawyer,

you can sign it too

and then it'll be official.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<line>
Divorce completed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<line>
-Yay.

-We did it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<line>
Take that, our marriage!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<line>
-Well, I guess I'll see you around?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<line>
-I was going to--

-Sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
-[both laughing]

-Sorry. Just go all the way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<line>
-Well, bye.

-Cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<line>
[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
[Flip] And, cut.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<line>
-[buzzes]

-[Flip] We got it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<line>
What's that for? We've all seen me naked.

back in the bottle now, baby.
