{\an8}Well, the photographer's here.

Where is Crackerjack?

He was aware that we're posing

for a family photo portrait.

I've got to ankle back to Indianapolis.

So you were with Sarah Lynn

when she died, right?

<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<line>
-No.

-TMZ said you took her to the hospital.

<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
-And you held her hand.

-Did you cry?

<line>
-I'm not--

-Did she totally poop her pants?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<line>
I heard people poop their pants

when they die.

<line>
-Listen to me--

-God, is that true?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

and that totally changes things.

Hey, Not BoJack, did you hear they're

making a miniseries about Sarah Lynn?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<line>
-BoJack is being played by Paul Giamatti.

-What?!

</line>

Why would you get Paul Giamatti

to play me... meaty roles like that one?

to fix the door?

-What do you care?

-I don't.

would've been torn down years ago.

It's a blight on the neighborhood.

on the top of the shit sandwich.

has cherries on top?

your door instead of my metaphor?

Who's BoJack Horseman?

He's a very famous TV and film star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
Or he was, yeah, before he gave it all up

for a life of quiet anonymity.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<line>
Where is he? Nobody knows.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

Perhaps he's even...

in this very room.

How am I supposed to sell sugar <i>and</i>

keep my secretary's self-esteem afloat

when you're having

honest-to-goodness fits of hysteria?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
-Don't yell, Father.

-I just can't anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<line>
I can't stop thinking about him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<line>
I can't be with people

and I can't be alone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<line>
I don't know how to be better, Joseph.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<line>
-Please fix me. I want to be better.

-[door opens]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
[panting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<line>
-[phone beeps]

-[line ringing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<line>
[muffled gasp]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<line>
BoJack? Where are you?

Are you okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<line>
[panting] I don't know. I'm so sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
It's okay. Talk to me.

What's going on?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<line>
[BoJack] <i>It's Michigan,</i>

<i>and it's beautiful here,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<line>
-and everything sucks.

<i>-Michigan?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<line>
-BoJack, come home.

<i>-I can't.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<line>
I don't belong there,

I don't belong anywhere.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<line>
But that's the thing,

everybody belongs in Los Angeles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<line>
<i>-There's, like, no barrier for entry.</i>

-Oh, God, that's true. [sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
They do let in just anybody.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<line>
I was at a coffee shop yesterday,

I heard a guy trying to impress someone

by soft-pitching a web series

he crowdfunded.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
Let me guess: the web series is about

how funny he and his friends are,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<line>
-just, like, hanging out.

-He described it as HBO's <i>Girls</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
-but, like, from a guy's perspective.

<i>-What?!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<line>
And he's just giving this away for free

in a coffee shop?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<line>
Somebody get this guy an overall!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<line>
Well, the important thing

is that barista's

definitely going to have sex

with him later.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<line>
[chuckling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
I've missed you, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<line>
I've missed you, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<line>
Mmm. [slurping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<line>
-Is Mother okay?

-She is now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
She just let her womanly emotions

get the better of her, that's all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
Nothing a little operation couldn't fix.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
Operation?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<line>
What's broken in the heart

can never be repaired,

but the brain, well, we have

all sorts of science for the brain.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<line>
She's a brand new woman now,

and she'd like to meet you very much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
[note plays]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<line>
-Mother?

-Oh, hello.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<line>
It's Beatrice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:44" />

<line>
Yes, that's right.

What a pretty girl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<line>
-What did they do to you? [sobs]

-Oh, hush.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<line>
It's okay. I'm better now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<line>
I don't understand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<line>
Love does things to a person,

terrible things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<line>
[sniffles, sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<line>
Beatrice, promise me

you'll never love anyone

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<line>
-as much as I loved Crackerjack.

-I promise. I won't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<line>
Why, I have half a mind...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<line>
[truck advancing, beeping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<line>
Keep going, keep going, keep going.

There we go, big boy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:19" />

<line>
Hey, what's going on out here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<line>
Probably should have warned you,

when these guys tear the house down

it might make some noise.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<line>
Tear the <i>house </i>down?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<line>
Uh, yeah. You think I just want

to mope around in a shrine to the past,

getting off on my own guilt

while the rest of my life passes me by?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<line>
Pathetic, much?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:33" />

<line>
But we spent the last eight months

restoring this place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:36" />

<line>
Yeah, and then you tried to kill me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:38" />

<line>
That's usually a series wrap

on a friendship.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:40" />

<line>
-What is a series wrap?

-Are you serious?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:42" />

<line>
Oh, my God, what am I doing

in this backwash of a town?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:45" />

<line>
Do you even get Showtime here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:47" />

<line>
-So what was all this for?

-I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:49" />

<line>
Guess it was just a big waste of time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:51" />

<line>
But you can't change the past.

Time's arrow marches on, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:54" />

<line>
I don't believe this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:55" />

<line>
Well, as a great woman once said,

suck a dick, dumbshit. [grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:00" />

<line>
-Where are you going?

-Home.

</line>
