<p>
[BoJack] <i>Piece of shit.</i>

<i>Stupid piece of shit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:09" />

<p>
<i>You're a real stupid piece of shit.</i>

<i>But I know I'm a piece of shit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<p>
<i>That makes me better</i>

<i>than all the pieces of shit</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<p>
<i>who don't know they're pieces of shit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<p>
<i>Or is it worse? Breakfast.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<p>
<i>Oh, I don't deserve breakfast. Shut up.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
<i>Don't feel sorry for yourself.</i>

<i>Get breakfast, you stupid fat-ass.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
<i>These are cookies. This is not breakfast.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
<i>You are eating cookies. Stop it.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<p>
<i>Stop eating cookies,</i>

<i>go make yourself breakfast.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
<i>Stop it. Don't eat one more cookie.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<p>
<i>Put that down. Do not eat that cookie.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<p>
-[crunching]

<i>-I can't believe you ate that cookie.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
-Hey, BoJack, we need milk.

-For the baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<p>
-For the what?

-Where is the baby? I saw...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<p>
-Can I borrow your car?

-What baby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<p>
I don't know.

Tina's gonna make breakfast.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<p>
She needs milk.

Can I take the car or what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Shit.</i>

<i>I don't want her driving my car,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
<i>getting her grubby hands all over.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
<i>She's not grubby, she's your daughter,</i>

<i>you piece of garbage.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<p>
<i>You're a piece of garbage,</i>

<i>a real shitty piece of garbage.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
<i>Think, idiot. If she takes the car,</i>

<i>you're trapped here with Mom</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<p>
<i>and her spooky lazy eyes.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
<i>If you get the milk</i>

<i>and leave Hollyhock with Mom,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<p>
<i>she could tell things about you,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<p>
<i>poison your daughter against you,</i>

<i>that what you want?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<p>
Okay, how about, um... Hold on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>They're looking.</i>

<i>Say something!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
<i>Open your idiot dumb mouth!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<p>
I will get milk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<p>
[door opens, closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Milk, milk.</i>

<i>What are they talking about now?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<p>
<i>Probably you and what a dumb piece</i>

<i>of trash you are, you fat sack of idiot.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
<i>Why not do the world a favor</i>

<i>and swerve into oncoming traffic?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<p>
<i>No, you don't deserve to die young,</i>

<i>only the greats die young.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<p>
<i>Oh, now you think you're young</i>

<i>all of a sudden?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<p>
<i>One drink.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<p>
<i>Whoa. Is it night suddenly?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<p>
<i>Suddenly sundown.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:33" />

<p>
<i>Suddenly "Sooze-town."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<p>
<i>What was that show?</i>

<i>"Suddenly Sooze-town?"</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:37" />

<p>
<i>Brooke Shields... something?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<p>
<i>Show was on for five years and now</i>

<i>nobody-- Oh, my God, is that life?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<p>
<i>You're there, you do your thing,</i>

<i>and then people forget.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<p>
<i>"Forget it, Jake. It's Sooze-town."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:47" />

<p>
<i>Is that me?</i>

<i>Am I the Suddenly Sooze-town of people?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

<p>
<i>Shit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<p>
-[groans]

-[door closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<p>
<i>Oh, shit. You gotta drive.</i>

<i>Sober up, buddy.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<p>
<i>Here we go, sober... now!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<p>
<i>Sober, now!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:58" />

<p>
<i>Come on, you drunk piece of shit,</i>

<i>be less drunk.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<p>
<i>Now! Okay.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:05" />

<p>
[alarm blaring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<p>
[screeching]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:08" />

<p>
<i>Idiot. What'd you do all day?</i>

<i>Piece of shit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:11" />

<p>
<i>That's a day you'll never get back.</i>

<i>What was that? You're a real piece of--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:14" />

<p>
-Where have you been?

-Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:17" />

<p>
Did you get the milk?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:19" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:21" />

<p>
{\an8}[theme music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Stupid piece of shit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
Oh, God. [groaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
If you're looking for the milk

Tina ended up getting,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<p>
Tina is using it to make us all breakfast.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<p>
[growls]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
Well, it's about time someone

pulls their weight around here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<p>
Henrietta, you should make

a healthy breakfast.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<p>
{\an8}-Okay, that's enough from you.

-For the baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
{\an8}No one loves a Fatty Patty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<p>
{\an8}-[groans]

-[Bea] Uh-oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Is my house</i>

<i>on a slant or something?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
{\an8}-[Bea] This wall needs to be painted.

-I'm gonna go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
You don't want to stick around,

eat breakfast together?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<p>
Great pitch, love your energy.

It's a pass.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
{\an8}[thinking] <i>What are you doing?</i>

<i>Go home.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>You're parked on Mulholland doing nothing, </i>

<i>you could be eating breakfast</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>with your long-lost daughter</i>

<i>and dying mother.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>You are a terrible person.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
{\an8}-[horn honking]

-Use the shoulder, asshole!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
<i>He gets it.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<p>
[laughs] I know,

I wanted to tell you right away.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<p>
-Right this way.

-Oh, I gotta go. See you tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<p>
If it isn't my favorite client,

Courtney Portnoy,

and also another client, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
It's always nice to be included

in a sentence someone says.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
So bad news first: <i>Ms. Taken</i>

was a miserable failure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<p>
-Princess Carolyn--

-But Courtney, more importantly,

audiences are going to adore

your tour de force performance

as the forceful denim-clad court reporter

in <i>The Court Reporter Sported Jorts,</i>

the jet-setting jort-sporting

court reporter story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
Yes, the film is spectacularly romantic

and well-titled,

but I need a change in representation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<p>
No! Courtney! Before you fire me--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
I'm not gonna fire you.

Heavens, no! I fired my agents.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
Oh, good. Yeah, agents are replaceable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
A manager is forever.

That's the takeaway here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
I think you'll fall in love

with my new agent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<p>
-Love her already. Who is she?

-He.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<p>
Yes, he, he, ha, ha.

[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<p>
-Now tell me her name.

-Rutabaga Rabitowitz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
Oh, fish.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
{\an8}We got a nice bounce

off of Court's engagement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
{\an8}"Court" is what I'm calling Courtney

for wordplay-related reasons

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
{\an8}that'll become apparent

at the end of this sentence,

but that bounce has lost its pounce,

and if we want to keep

this name in the news,

we're going to need a full-<i>court</i> press.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<p>
{\an8}So what do you do after an engagement?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<p>
{\an8}D-d-d-doy!

Wedding of the century.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<p>
{\an8}Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
{\an8}We're talking floral arrangements.

We're talking procession of elephants.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<p>
{\an8}We're talking Jaden Smith

in a <i>Clockwork Orange</i> costume,

reading a poem he wrote...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
Does that poem rhyme? No!

What are you, crazy? Of course it doesn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
{\an8}And, uh-oh, was someone looking

for Sebastian Janikowski,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
{\an8}because here's the kicker--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<p>
{\an8}we do the whole thing the weekend

before the movie drops. Bam!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
{\an8}-Weekend before the movie drops?

-Boom!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<p>
{\an8}-That's this weekend.

-Ka-zow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
{\an8}-Four days from today.

-Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<p>
Today? That's today!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<p>
Which is why it's so perfect.

No notice is the new notice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
{\an8}This wedding is so fancy

we don't care if you have other plans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
-Total status move.

-You're right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<p>
Being engaged is one thing,

but I'm not sure

I want to actually get married.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<p>
{\an8}We can draw up a standard

Hollywoo sham-marriage contract:

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
{\an8}-three years, non-exclusive, huge payday.

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
And I presume

you'll be arranging everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
As Courtney's agent I'm happy to help,

but I believe traditionally

it's the bride's manager

who plans the wedding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<p>
[groans] Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Idiot. Stupid animal. Oaf.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
[Bea] You are just the prettiest thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
-Yes, you are.

-Who are you talking to?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<p>
Keep it down, oaf.

You'll make the baby cry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<p>
-Baby?

-Yes, you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<p>
She kept asking where the baby was,

so I had Tina get her this doll.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
-She's totes into it.

-Mom is "totes" into a baby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<p>
Is it possible the baby

got dipped in brandy at some point?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
Or cigarettes, or regressive ideas

about immigrants?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<p>
-I think she just wanted a baby.

-Coochie-coochie-coo...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
You shouldn't indulge her delusions.

It's not right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
But she seemed really down.

And you're never around anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
It was getting depressing to look at her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
That's why I made her this pillowcase.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
You just put this over her head

and everything is fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<p>
-[groans]

-[Bea] Dark in here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<p>
-[growls]

-Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
So they're airing an <i>F.H.B.A. Miami</i>

marathon this weekend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<p>
Does anyone want to come over?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<p>
Oh, I actually have a big announcement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
I'm marrying Courtney Portnoy

this weekend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<p>
-Wow! Great, Todd. Good for you.

-That's amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<p>
I know it's pretty wild for an asexual

to get married, but...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
Not really. John and I are aces

and we're married.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<p>
-Really?

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
Our wedding was nautical-themed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<p>
Why nautical?

Is that, like, an asexual thing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
No, man. We just really like boats.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
Asexual just means

you're not interested in sex.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:49" />

<p>
Some asexuals are also a-romantic,

but others have relationships

like anyone else.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<p>
But involving boats?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<p>
I feel like you're getting really hung up

on the boats thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<p>
So, it's not weird

for an ace to get married?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<p>
No, if you found someone who really

accepts you for who you are, go for it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<p>
I will! I mean, I am. I mean, am I?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
Mmm! Beatrice, this coffee is amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>You stupid garbage fire.</i>

<i>Everything sucks.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<p>
BoJack, did you see

what your mother is doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<p>
Isn't it incredible?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:29" />

<p>
Yeah, making breakfast

at three in the afternoon. So with it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
Isn't this baby well-behaved?

Hardly ever cries.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
Probably because you're such

a good mother, Beatrice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
Don't say that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<p>
I was very nervous

to have a baby in the house,

but it turns out,

all it needed is a mother's love.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<p>
Oh, when you grow up,

you can be anything you want to be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Lousy baby.</i>

<i>What did it ever do that was so great?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
<i>Am I jealous of a doll?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<p>
<i>Maybe if that doll wasn't so smug,</i>

<i>looking at me with its creepy doll eyes...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<p>
She's tricking you, Hollyhock.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<p>
-This is not what she's really like.

-Who cares?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
Whatever beef you have with your mom,

that's just a sweet confused old lady.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
-[thinking] <i>She's right.</i>

-Wrong. She's in there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
-She knows exactly what she's doing.

-You are so paranoid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
Please stop fighting.

All this shouting is bad for the baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
Where was that keen parenting insight

50 years ago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
[gasps] Henrietta,

you're unfit to be a parent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<p>
-I'm unfit?

-[thinking] <i>It's true, jackass.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<p>
You think it's so hard

to be a parent to a doll? I could do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Hey, look, I'm cradling the baby.

Hope I don't drop it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<p>
[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<p>
Oh, no! I dropped it, but it's not crying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<p>
Guess it's okay. I'm an amazing parent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
What if I left it in its room all day

and didn't feed it or change it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
Oh, that's okay, too.

I must be mother of the year!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<p>
-BoJack.

-I know! What if for 18 years straight

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
I just tell it how worthless it is

every day, how it embarrasses me,

how my life would be better

if it was never born?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<p>
Would that be a good idea?

Probably, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<p>
Give me the baby back, you worthless waste

of my husband's jism!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
-Oh, so you <i>do </i>know who I am.

-Govern yourself, Henrietta.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<p>
Hey, you think the baby would be okay

if I threw it over the side of my deck?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
-Probably, right?

-[Bea gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<p>
BoJack, don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Do it.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<p>
Nah, I'm just kidding around.

Here you go, Mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
Oh, no! My hands are so slippery!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
Oh, no! Oh, oh, oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>
No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Nice arm.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<p>
-[sobbing]

-Why did you do that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<p>
-[growling]

<i>-You goddamn piece of shit idiot asshole.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<p>
<i>This is what you do.</i>

<i>This is what you always do.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
<i>This is why Mom loves Doll more than you.</i>

<i>She's right. Doll never hurt anybody.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
<i>Doll wouldn't throw you</i>

<i>over the side of a mountain.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
<i>Gotta make things right.</i>

<i>Gotta get Doll back.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
<i>Okay, one drink. And then, Doll back.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
<i>You screw-up.</i>

<i>You're making your daughter hate you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
<i>Which is good, because look what happens</i>

<i>when people love you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<p>
<i>Look at Penny. And Herb. And Sarah Lynn.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<p>
<i>It's because you made them love you,</i>

<i>BoJack.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
<i>You gotta fix this, dummy.</i>

<i>How can you fix this?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<p>
<i>Princess Carolyn?</i>

<i>She hates your guts.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<p>
<i>Todd? No.</i>

<i>Diane? Yes! Oh, good.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
<i>Good old responsible Diane,</i>

<i>she'll know what to do.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<p>
Oh... aah...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
-[groaning]

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
"California can't wait."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<p>
Am I Ace of Base right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
Because all that I want

is another one of these babies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
BoJack Horseman?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<p>
What is this, a will.i.am-style

celebrity endorsement video?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
-Where's Diane?

-Oh, she's on the roof.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<p>
Boy, will she be surprised

to see you. Diane!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>What are you doing?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<p>
No, not like this.

She doesn't know I'm here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<p>
First time she sees me

can't be drunk asking for help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<p>
-What's wrong? You need help?

-<i>Idiot.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
You gotta get me outta here.

Where did I park?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
-Um...

-Beep. Beep, beep?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
You shouldn't be driving right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<p>
Why don't I make like Eddie Money

and take you home tonight?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<p>
No, I can't go home. Not without Doll.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
Also, Eddie Money doesn't do

the taking home in "Take Me Home Tonight,"

so if you're taking me home,

then I would be Eddie Money.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
Okay, something's going on with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
-It's not like you to be so testy.

-Yes, it is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
Everyone, take the rest of the day off.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<p>
My pal BoJack needs a friend day.

California can wait!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<p>
Elton, you <i>have</i> to play this wedding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
We want one of those <i>Stranger Things</i>

kids to be the ring-bearer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
They're still little?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<p>
You're gonna do a duet

with a hologram of Nat King Cole.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<p>
Or, if that's cost-prohibitive,

Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<p>
Puberty?

Can we give them something for that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<p>
-Great.

-Fabulous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
We are killing this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<p>
We are doing to this wedding

what Rob Durst did to that lady

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<p>
-and what Fred Durst did to his career.

-[door opens]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
I have terrible news. It's Meryl Streep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<p>
-[both gasp]

-Did Meryl Streep die?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<p>
No, she's retiring.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<p>
Mr. McGregor!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
You cannot just walk into a room and say,

"I have terrible news about Meryl Streep."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
Her retirement party

is scheduled for this Saturday.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
All of Hollywoo will be attending.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
This Saturday? No, no, no!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
How is #TortneyChortnoy

supposed to compete with that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
We're toast.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
Unless, uh, we could somehow get Meryl

to postpone her party?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<p>
Hmm... what if we put together

a project so enticing

she couldn't help but climb aboard?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<p>
-One more gig...

-Means no more retirement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
But what could we possibly offer her

that she hasn't already done?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<p>
-Ah. What does every actor want to do?

-Direct.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<p>
-Direct!

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<p>
But the dream of any director

is to work with Meryl Streep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<p>
You think Meryl wants to direct

a bunch of actors who aren't Meryl Streep?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<p>
-Hah! What a nightmare!

-Okay, all right. Okay, fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>
But, okay, okay, and this...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<p>
What if all the actors in the movie

<i>were </i>Meryl Streep?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<p>
-What? No!

-Are you suggesting some sort of

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<p>
<i>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</i>

type situation

where Meryl Streep plays every role?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
Bingo-bongo, weirdo-beardo.

All the greats have done it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<p>
Peter Sellers, Sir Alec Guinness,

Flo from the Progressive ads.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<p>
Let's take this to the Streep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
Hey, look. Maybe this is a baby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
-Mmm.

-[door opens]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
-Welcome...

-Hey, hey!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<p>
...to the nightmare, non-sexy version of

<i>Three's Company </i>that my life has become.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<p>
Oh, good. Instead of getting

the doll back, like you said you would,

you disappeared for a few hours

and found a friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
For your information, we are on the case.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<p>
Just need a whiff of your mom

to track the scent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<p>
Uh, excuse me, young lady,

I'm looking for a Beatrice,

but you're way too young and attractive

to be that mean old crone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
-What?

-What are you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
[sniffing] Okay, I'm picking up

on some fruity overtones.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
Oak, desert sage... [chuckles]

No, I'm just kidding around.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<p>
It's smelling humor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
Is this the best time

to be workshopping your tight five?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<p>
[sniffing] Okay, got it.

Ooh, this way?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
[sniffing] No! No, no. That way!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>
-[glasses clattering]

-[sniffing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
Out the door! Come on! Here we go!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<p>
-[groans]

-[door opens, shuts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<p>
[sniffing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Look at him. Not a care</i>

<i>in the world. How does he do it?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<p>
[sniffs] This is the place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
[doorbell rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
-Oh, hi, I'm--

-BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<p>
-Felicity Huffman?

-Looking for this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
-Yes!

-Well, keep looking, buddy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
You're a real piece of shit,

you know that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<p>
Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
[grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
So, instead of talking

through your issues,

your new thing

is to just get in really big fights

and then have hot angry sex?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<p>
-Yeah, but it kind of works.

-Does it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
I'm sorry,

I feel like we always talk about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<p>
What's going on with you, Roxie?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<p>
-I'm actually glad you asked, I...

-[grunts] Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<p>
Hey, Diane, can I get your advice

on something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<p>
-Yeah, of course. I'm not doing anything.

-Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<p>
So, I have this friend,

and his name

is Darnarius McQuimberton.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<p>
Oh, yeah,

I think I read an article about him

in <i>Real, Not Made-Up, Person Magazine.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

<p>
Darnarius is supposed to get married

this weekend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:34" />

<p>
And it's going to be an amazing wedding,

but it's kind of based on a lie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<p>
Should he go through with it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<p>
Well, all weddings are lies, right?

Sort of.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<p>
You're making this big declaration

about how you're gonna stay

with this person forever,

but you don't actually know that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<p>
You're just saying it.

The whole thing is a farce.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<p>
-Yeah, that's true.

-But it's a lie based on truth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<p>
Like, at the center of the farce

there's this nugget

of something real and pure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<p>
And that strange beautiful something

is why you put up

with everything else, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<p>
I guess so.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
And sometimes it's hard to remember

that pure, shining thing

because it's been painted over

with so many arguments

and compromises and disappointments.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<p>
But you have to believe

it's still down there somewhere,

even if you can't see it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
And maybe even the belief in it

is more important than the thing itself,

but only as long as you still believe it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:29" />

<p>
-Does that make sense?

-Yeah. Thanks, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
You've given me

and Darquimbertus McNarington

a lot to think about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<p>
That was good advice.

I'm, like, a really good friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
[doorbell rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<p>
-What?

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<p>
So that doll actually belongs to my mom.

She's very sick, very frail.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<p>
And I know you're really mad at me

because...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
<i>Think, shit-for-brains, think.</i>

<i>Why is Felicity Huffman mad at you?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
<i>You cut her off in traffic,</i>

<i>got her fired off a project,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
<i>talked shit about her at an AIDS benefit</i>

<i>and didn't realize your mic was on.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />

<p>
I have been living directly under

your house for the last 15 years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<p>
Do you have any idea how much shit

you throw over the side of your deck?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:11" />

<p>
Beer bottles, lit cigarettes,

scripts where the lead is female.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<p>
One time, a mountain

of regurgitated cotton candy

sat on that hill for a month

before sliding into my hot tub.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<p>
Who you think has to deal with that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
I assume your maid

or gardener or something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<p>
Well, yeah.

But it's still super-obnoxious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<p>
You're not getting that doll back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:32" />

<p>
Citizens, citizens.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
As the future governor of California,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
I pride myself on probably being able

to reach compromises

across the ideological spectrum.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<p>
-Oh! What if we cut the baby in half?

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<p>
-Why would we do that?

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
So you both agree that's a bad idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<p>
Perhaps you're not so different after all?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<p>
-Advantage: Peanutbutter.

-How is that...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
Felicity Huffman, you are a beloved star

of film and television.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<p>
BoJack, you have also

appeared in film and television.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<p>
What's that like? Discuss.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>
I'm sorry for my acquaintance.

I'm actually a big fan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<p>
[thinking]<i> I hope</i>

<i>she has no follow-up questions.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<p>
Really? So you've probably

seen my new show,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
<i>-F.H.B.A. Los Angeles.</i>

-[thinking] <i>What?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<p>
-Yup, love it.

-How'd you like to do an arc for sweeps?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Ugh, TV? No.</i>

<i>I just got out of that sinkhole.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:16" />

<p>
He'll do it, if you give us our doll back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
Hup... ho... hup!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<p>
[Princess Carolyn] <i>What's your status?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>
I have breached Compound Streep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<p>
If I don't make it out of this alive,

just know I have already seen heaven

and it is Meryl's rose garden.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<p>
-And the offer?

-I put it under a big box

that's propped up by a stick.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<p>
If she goes to look

and the box falls on her,

she's contractually obligated

to do the movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<p>
Yeah, I know what

"packaging talent" means.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
Okay, she's walking up to the box.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
She's sniffing around, and...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<p>
-[box slides, woman screams]

-We got Meryl!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<p>
All right! Yes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>What if I throw myself</i>

<i>off my deck</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
<i>into Felicity Huffman's backyard.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<p>
<i>If she found my dead body,</i>

<i>that'd show her.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
Why are we at a bar?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<p>
We're just celebrating getting Doll back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
You don't want to bring the doll back

to your mom?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
I will. We're just having a drink first.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
-Relax.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>He knows you're terrible.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<p>
<i>He's the biggest idiot in the world,</i>

<i>even he knows you're terrible.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<p>
So when did you get a daughter?

She's new, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<p>
-Or was she always part of the gang?

-I met her about a month ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<p>
-Whoa!

-Yeah. And it was great, at first.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<p>
But now I can feel her getting attached,

and I just know

I'm gonna BoJack things up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
"BoJack things up?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<p>
You mean, show up somewhere

and be the life of the party?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
Then share a laugh

with your good friend, Mr. Peanutbutter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<p>
No, obviously I meant screw everything up

until she hates me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<p>
I don't think I can take that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
Maybe this time, don't do the thing

that makes her hate you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
I don't want to,

but every time she looks at me

with those big innocent eyes,

all I can think about

is every shitty thing I've ever done,

and I think,

"I don't deserve that kind of love."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
Look, BoJack, I don't know a lot

about balancing a state budget

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
-or how a bill becomes a law.

-Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<p>
I don't know a lot about a lot of things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
But I do know this:

everybody deserves to be loved.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
[clinking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<p>
So we put together an all-star wedding

and a Meryl Streep movie in one day!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<p>
-You got to admit, we're a good team.

-Rutabaga...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<p>
I know it wasn't always smooth sailing

for the Good Ship You and Me,

but now you've got a boyfriend

and I've got a family,

and since we have to work together again,

we're a good team.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<p>
Tell me you didn't miss this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<p>
-Todd is on line two.

-Aaah! Do you go <i>through </i>the walls?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<p>
Todd! Have you finished

your groomsmen list?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
We gotta figure out

how many parachutes we need.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<p>
Uh, guys, I-- I can't marry Courtney.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
-What?

-No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<p>
I've been doing some thinking,

and marriage is like a Tootsie Pop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
The lollipop part is a lie,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
<i>but at the center of the lie</i>

<i>there's a truth.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<p>
That's the Tootsie Roll,

and that's why people get married.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
But if I married Courtney

it would be a lie without any truth in it,

like a Tootsie Pop

with just the lollipop part

and nothing in the middle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
So, a lollipop? That's still pretty good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<p>
[Todd] <i>I guess it's a bad analogy.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
But I don't want a fake marriage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
I'm sorry I didn't realize that before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
[sighs] Okay, Todd.

You gotta do what's right for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
<i>Thanks, Princess Carolyn.</i>

<i>Whoa--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<p>
All right, blue sky time. Wedding's off.

Can we spin this somehow?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
Courtney got jilted,

play the sympathy card?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<p>
I guess we could put out a statement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
That's your solution?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
What happened to the guy

from this morning with all the big ideas?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<p>
Oh, that guy dies at six.

This guy's gotta get home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<p>
I got seven kids and a wife

who's really into me co-parenting,

or, as she calls it, "parenting."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
Well, can't you tuck the kids into bed,

read them some script coverage

of the film adaptation of <i>Good Night Moon</i>

and then come back?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<p>
-This is important.

-Well, my kids are important.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
Fine, both things are equally important.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
Oh, my God, thank God you're not a mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<p>
You would be hilarious at it.

[sips]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
Hey, today was fun.

I'll call you in the morning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<p>
We'll figure this out. We'll deal with it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
-[door opens]

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<p>
If you'd like to never see him again,

I have ways of getting rid of him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
What kind of ways?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<p>
Asking him politely to not come back.

Actually, that's only one way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<p>
I apologize for misleading you

about the number of ways.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
He's a jerk, right? It's not just me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<p>
I worked with guys like him at F.M.E.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
When I left, I swore

I would never work at a big agency again,

because I can't work

with people like that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<p>
You don't think I'm like that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
No, because you care about people

other than yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<p>
And for what it's worth,

you will be a wonderful mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<p>
-You're not just saying that?

-I never just say anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<p>
I choose words very carefully,

with an eye towards precision

and expediency.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
I'm surprised you haven't noticed that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<p>
-Good night, Judah.

-Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
[door closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<p>
[muffled grunts and yells]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
Okay. [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<p>
-It's about time, Henrietta.

-You're welcome.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
[growls]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>Go talk to her, idiot.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<p>
<i>Drink first. No, you stupid alcoholic.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<p>
<i>Talk to your daughter. You're ruining her.</i>

<i>You know that, right?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
<i>No matter what,</i>

<i>your poison is already in her.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<p>
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

<i>That's not true.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<p>
<i>Yeah, it is, you stupid piece of shit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
<i>You're a real stupid piece of shit,</i>

<i>and everywhere you go you destroy people.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<p>
<i>Your mother never loved you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<p>
<i>That's why Sarah Lynn died,</i>

<i>Charlotte'll never forgive you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
<i>What you gonna do to Hollyhock?</i>

<i>What you gonna do, asshole? Shut up!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
[exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
Got Doll back. No big deal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
Where do you go,

when you disappear all day?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<p>
Just drive around.

Sometimes I go to a bar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<p>
Sometimes I pull over

by the side of the road,

just sit there for hours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<p>
Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<p>
And you'd rather do that

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
-than spend time with me?

-Hollyhock...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
I know you didn't ask

for this dorky 17-year-old

to just show up at your door.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
And I'm sorry if I'm annoying,

but I didn't ask...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<p>
-No, Hollyhock, I'm glad you're here.

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
If I'm shitty,

that's just because I'm shitty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<p>
You're allowed to be mad at me,

but you need to know that whatever I do,

it's not your fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<p>
I know. I mean, I know,

but I don't always know, you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<p>
Like, sometimes I have this tiny voice

in the back of my head that goes, like,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<p>
"Hey, everyone hates you!

And they're not wrong to feel that way!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:19" />

<p>
I know what you mean.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<p>
That voice, the one that tells you

you're worthless and stupid and ugly?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<p>
-Yeah?

-It goes away, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<p>
It's just, like, a dumb teenage-girl

thing, but then it goes away?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:33" />

<p>
Yeah.
