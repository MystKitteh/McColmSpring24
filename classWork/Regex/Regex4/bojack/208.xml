<p>
-We're live in five minutes, folks.

-[crew member] Make way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<p>
Someone find out the average rainfall

in Bora Bora.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
Thank you so much for doing this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<p>
Hey, there are a lot of advantages to

being the girlfriend of a big celebrity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
It's more than being an elbow

they couldn't crop out of

a red-carpet shot in <i>US Weekly.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
-I've been that elbow.

-Hello, what have we here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
So you know

how the game's played, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<p>
I'm sure I'll pick it up.

How hard could it be?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
You didn't read the treatment?

I faxed it to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
My bad, our fax machine

isn't plugged in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
BoJack, this is our first show

and it is very important that things

run smoothly tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
I mean, do you even care

about this at all?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<p>
Sweetie, no. I think this is stupid

and a waste of everybody's time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
But you're my girlfriend

and I care about you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
-So I'm here.

-Okay. Break a leg.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<p>
[vocalizing] Me, me, me. My, my, my.

Bow-wow-wow-wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
Good boy, good boy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
Okay, this is it, everybody.

Moment of truth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
Now it's in the hands of god.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<p>
And for the next 30 minutes,

I am that God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
-I got you an iPad, ma'am.

-Oh, no thanks, Mia.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<p>
I'm still working my way through

the last 30 years of technology.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<p>
Right now I'm on Palm Pilot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<p>
But you can use our second screen app

to see what viewers say

about the show as it airs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<p>
Oh, cool,

I love stupid bullshit like this. Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
Oh, you just touch it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<p>
Hello, I am Mustache Todd.

Like regular Todd, but with a mustache.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<p>
Listen boo-boo, I didn't graduate first in

my class from a prestigious university,

rise through the ranks at

an elite news organization,

win a well-known award,

never ever be sick at sea

and also my name is Mia McKibben,

so that I could deal with your nonsense.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<p>
-[grunts]

-Todd, stay out of Hair and Makeup.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<p>
But I like it there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<p>
They brush my hair and tell me stories

about their weekends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<p>
Big-nosed Todd wasn't funny,

Zombie Todd wasn't funny,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:47" />

<p>
Pretty Lady Todd wasn't funny,

and this isn't funny.

No more tomfoolery.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:51" />

<p>
When it's me,

we call it "Todd-foolery."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<p>
We certainly do not call it that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<p>
Listen up, everyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:57" />

<p>
What you are part of tonight

is bigger than you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:59" />

<p>
It's bigger than any of us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<p>
I expect all of you to work together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:03" />

<p>
But I also expect that one of you

will tower above the rest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<p>
And that outstanding individual

will receive this pen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:11" />

<p>
It was through this pen that I bled

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:14" />

<p>
<i>Raise High The Roof Beam,</i>

<i>Carpenters </i>upon the page.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:17" />

<p>
Also, it has four different colors.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:19" />

<p>
Black, red, blue

and for some reason, green.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:22" />

<p>
By the end of tonight,

this pen will be bestowed upon

the person most deserving.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:27" />

<p>
Because nothing is more

important than television,

and no one more important than

the people who make that television.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:34" />

<p>

<p>
{\an8}Hey, this is Mr. Peanutbutter's show,

so be nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<p>
{\an8}When you say nice, do you mean kind?

<p>
{\an8}Or, like,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

{\an8}-What the--?

-That noise means

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<p>
{\an8}it's time for your first

General Knowledge question.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<p>
Audience, does BoJack know things?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
[audience] Let's find out!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<p>
{\an8}BoJack, what is the average

annual rainfall in Bora Bora?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
-Uh, this is general knowledge?

-It's just an average we're asking for.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<p>
-I don't know, seven?

-Wrong! So wrong.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
{\an8}Wow, when it comes to Bora Bora,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<p>
{\an8}maybe this celebrity should

have studied more-a more-a.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<p>
[J.D.]

Yes, Mr. Peanutbutter. Go for the kill.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
-That doesn't really seem--

-[woman] <i>They're all dead!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
<i>I watched them die!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
-What is--?

-Oh-ho. That sound means

it's time to pick your category.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
"Trigonometry." "Advanced Physics,"

and "At the Movies With Mr. Peanutbutter."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
At the Movies With

Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<p>
Good choice. After seeing J.J. Abrams'

<i>Star Trek </i>reboot, did I call it:

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
{\an8}A, "A visual feast for the senses,"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
{\an8}B, "A zestful lark through time

and space,"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
{\an8}C, "The best Zachary Quinto movie

of all time,"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<p>
{\an8}or D, "All of the above"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<p>
{\an8}-I'll say D?

-Ouch, the answer was A and B.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
<i>Though I would</i>

<i>also agree with C.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<p>
So I told Mr. Peanutbutter

I'd drive him here,

and next thing I know,

I'm an Associate Producer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
Stupid me. I went to Stanford.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
Next time I'll just try that

thing where I'm a huge dumbass

who happens to be friends

with Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
-Yup.

-Cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<p>
Well, have fun watching me

win that pen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<p>
I don't need a pen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
I can walk into any Chili's with a child

under 12 and get crayons for free.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
You don't get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
If Salinger gives you his pen,

that means you're worth something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
It means you're a serious person

who's going places.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<p>
Actually, you know what?

Don't worry about it. It's not for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<p>
I'm gonna go with nuclear fusion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
-[buzzer sounds]

-Oh, the answer is Egypt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
Turn up the directional heat lamps.

Oh, yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<p>
Let's really make him sweat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
Surprised you didn't get that one,

since you're an expert

when it comes to de-Nile.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
Quick impression. [drinks]

"I'm not an alcoholic."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
[laughs] You love it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<p>
Oh, yeah, pretty good one from King Mutt

over here. Am I right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
You know, like King Tut?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<p>
Because we're talking about Egypt?

And Mr. Peanutbutter's a mutt, so...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
You suck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<p>
I'm a yellow lab, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<p>
-You could get one thing right tonight.

-[audience laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
Anyway, let's take a moment

to look at the great comments

we've been getting on

our second screen app,

now available for download.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<p>
And we're out.

Fifteen seconds, everybody.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<p>
-Hey, how am I doing?

-You're kind of being a dick.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
Hey, are we at Tony Roma's right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<p>
Because there's a lot

of ribbing going on here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
I'm not ribbing you.

I'm telling you, you're--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
-And we're back in three, two...

-[music plays]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
Welcome back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
Will BoJack Horseman go down in show

history as our worst contestant ever?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
So far, yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<p>
Wait till they see this.

Mia, get ready to drop the bomb.

<p>
[woman] <i>Death from above!</i>

[Bojack gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<p>
Uh-oh. That sound means it's time

to drop "da" bomb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
And yes folks, I said "da," not "the."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<p>
What I'm trying to say is,

it's a positive bomb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<p>
Audience, let's...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<p>
[audience] Drop da bomb!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
{\an8}Did you guys all practice

before the show, because--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, we've had

some fun with our little celebrity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
But now, let's meet our big celebrity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<p>
-Big celebrity?

-Say hello to...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
{\an8}-Daniel Radcliffe!

-Hi, I'm Daniel Radcliffe. Hello.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
-Oh, my God! It's Daniel Radcliffe!

-[audience cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<p>
We'll find out what our big celebrity

knows right after this break.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<p>
[BoJack groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<p>
And we're out.

Oh, we're cooking now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
Hey, you, you're doing great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<p>
I'm not 100 percent watching

because I'm so engrossed

in the second screen experience,

but according to

the second screen experience,

other people are loving the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
You didn't tell me

there would be another celebrity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
Well, I had no idea that was coming

but some guy named Dong-Slinger-420

loved the surprise.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
He said, "Two dongs way up."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<p>
There was no mention of another bigger

celebrity in the document you faxed?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<p>
I couldn't read it. My fax machine

cut it into little strips.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
-That sounds like a shredder.

-Well, I guess I shredded it to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
-[iPad chimes]

-I gotta deal with this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
If I don't interact with this app

every 80 seconds,

it charges my credit card five dollars.

Love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
[mumbling] Ehh... you, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Could you get the base

a little less pale?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<p>
-Hey, Daniel, good to see you.

-Always nice to meet a fan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<p>
-No, sorry, I'm not a, uh-- I'm an actor.

-Oh, good for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
It's a dreadful business

but hang in there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
No, I already did hang in there.

I'm BoJack Horseman?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
We've actually met before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<p>
At Chris Martin's holiday party?

We stepped outside for a smoke?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
-To get away from Chris Martin?

-Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
You opened up

about your fear of success?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<p>
I gave you some advice?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<p>
You said I was a true friend

and you would never forget me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<p>
And you said your name

was Chadwick Boseman?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
-BoJack Horseman.

-Oh, I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<p>
When you're as famous as I am,

you meet so many people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
Sorry, we need you guys back on set.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
You were the second hairdresser's

assistant on <i>The Ellen Show</i>

about five years ago.

Veronica, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
-Yeah, that's right.

-How was your mother's party in the end?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<p>
And we're back in five, four,

three, two...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
So you never say one, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>
-Welcome back, America.

-[man] We love you, Daniel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
[laughs] So do I. So let's watch

our celebrities go... Audience?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
[all] Head to head!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<p>
<i>How could they possibly know that?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
<i>-This is the first episode, right?</i>

-[J.D. laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
The puppets clap

when the puppetmaster pulls the strings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
Hello. Serious,

Going-Places Todd at your service.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<p>
Hey, look at you, all dressed up

for the Dipshit Awards.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
You know you're not allowed

in Hair and Makeup.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
-Are you wearing roller skates?

-I'm wearing Heelys.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
They're shoes with wheels,

for efficiency purposes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
-Now I can be serious faster.

-You can also go nowhere faster.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
Seeing as I am a professional--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<p>
-[buzzer sounds]

-Oh, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
Another embarrassingly

wrong answer,

bringing your score down

by 80 points and 12 dollars.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<p>
Why are we playing

for both points and dollars?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<p>
-Oh, tough break, B.J. Novak!

-My name is--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
Our next question is to Mr. Radcliffe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<p>
"What color comes from

the combination of blue and yellow?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
I actually know this one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
When I was growing up,

my neighbor was a painter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
I remember visiting his flat

and watching him work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<p>
Sometimes he would mix together

blue paint with yellow paint

and it made an entirely new color.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
And that man was Banksy.

And that color was green.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<p>
-Final answer.

-Correct!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
You've earned

the chance to go for a spin

in our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<p>
[audience cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<p>
Oh, splendid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<p>
And while Daniel's in the booth,

BoJack, you have an essay question.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<p>
-What?

-You'll find a blue book on your podium.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
"To what extent was feudalism

a cause of the French Revolution?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
-Wait, are you ser-- Oh!

-And go!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
While BoJack works,

let's check out the action

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<p>
-on our Kia Sportage Cash Grab Booth Cam.

-[audience cheers]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
-Hey, champ.

-What are you doing here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<p>
I'm trying to write an essay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<p>
I came to ask you how you were doing

and then to tell you

you're not doing so well.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<p>
Why am I getting

the hard questions,

while Boy Wizard over there

just has to know colors

and literally grab cash out of thin air?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<p>
[Daniel laughs] A five! This is so easy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
I think I might be able to help you out.

Let me tell you a story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
<i>The year was 2003</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
<i>and for some reason, everyone was</i>

<i>playing poker all of a sudden.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<p>
<i>A then-relevant Wilmer Valderrama</i>

<i>used to host a weekly how-do-you-do</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
<i>and all the stars</i>

<i>came out to show off their tricks.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
<i>There was Lucy Lawless, Lucy Liu,</i>

<i>Lori Laughlin, Lisa Loeb,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
<i>the dog from </i>Frasier,

<i>and at the head of the table?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
<i>Big Money himself, Mr. Peanutbutter.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
Whoops. Woh-oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<p>
<i>I thought, "Here's a rube."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<p>
[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<p>
<i>But Lady Luck had other plans.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<p>
You know what,

I got an essay to write,

so if this isn't about the precipitous

fall of the French ruling class--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
<i>But then I saw, the kid had a tell.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
I feel like that story had a lot

of unnecessary details in it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
Listen. You have to pay close attention,

it's subtle,

but when he gets excited, his ears ever

so slightly flop up and give him away.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<p>
Well, that's no surprise. Guy's been

flopping upwards his whole career.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>
Mm-hm. Watch the ears.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
[horn blows]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<p>
Time's up, Daniel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<p>
Whoa, looks like D to the R

to the Ad to the Cliffe

just won 54,000 bonus dollars.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<p>
And BoJack barely got beyond

his thesis statement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<p>
[audience laughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<p>
[clears throat]

"A continent ravaged by war,

coupled with the retreat

of the church from secular life..."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
-And then it just stops?

-[audience laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
Oh, that's gonna cost

you some serious pesos.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
But first, it's time for

our Multiple Choice Buzz-In Round.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
A buzz-in round? All right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<p>
In is my favorite direction

in which to buzz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<p>
Tell me, "How many oak trees are needed

to build an 18th century triple-decker

Royal Navy battle ship?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<p>
A, 75? B, 1000?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
Or C, 3500?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<p>
C! 3500!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
-Um, correct.

-Uh, what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
-Uh, wow. That's, uh...

-[mild applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
That's actually correct.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<p>
How the hell did he know that? What else

does he know? Does he know things?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<p>
Let's find out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<p>
Quantum tunneling.

King Magnus the Second.

<p>
Miss Scarlet in the library

with the lead pipe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<p>
Sassafras. Butterscotch! Argyle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<p>
-Because seven eight nine.

-[buzzes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
What an amazing run.

It looks like we've got a tied game.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:32" />

<p>
Which is an exciting surprise.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<p>
-Goddamn it, throw to commercial.

-We'll be right back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:38" />

<p>
[lively music playing over speakers]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<p>
-Hey. Horshack. What's going on?

-What's going on is I'm kicking your ass.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
{\an8}Yeah, you know, you're doing great,

but I'm supposed to win.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<p>
{\an8}That was the deal.

Plug my movie, win money for charity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, tell Charity she can kiss my ass.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
{\an8}By the way,

your girlfriend has a stripper name.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
{\an8}It's not my girlfriend, it's charity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
BoJack, according to this app,

you're almost tied.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<p>
Oh, you are tied, there's a lag.

Congratulations.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<p>
Thanks. It was touch and go--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
But I'm a little concerned

because it seems like

you might actually win,

but everyone on the app

is really rooting for Daniel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<p>
People love him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<p>
I guess he was in some movie about a

potter or a Pottery Barn or something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<p>
-Are you asking me to throw the game?

-You don't care about this game.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<p>
The only reason you're here is for me,

so maybe you could help me out?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<p>
-[sighs] Okay.

-You know what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
You're the best, no matter

what everybody on this app says.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<p>
They say you're the worst. Especially

Queefburglar69. He's their leader.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<p>
[audience cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<p>
And we're back. Contestants, I've got

a history question for both of you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<p>
"You may or may not be familiar with a

famous racehorse named Secretariat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<p>
In what year did Secretariat

win the Triple Crown?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
-[buzzer sounds]

-BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<p>
Piece of cake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<p>
Hmm?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<p>
Um, 1492?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
-[audience and Daniel laughing]

-What? No, not even close.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<p>
BoJack, aren't you in a movie

about Secretariat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
-How could you not know that?

-Let's just move on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
Maybe instead,

he should be in a movie

about a guy who doesn't know

anything about Secretariat. [laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
That would not be a good movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
I mean, more like Secre-terrible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
{\an8}Damn, Bojangles, you got served.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<p>
Do you know anything about Secretariat?

You know he was a horse, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<p>
Oh, wait, did I just spoil it for you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
No wonder my wife

had to write your book for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
Hey, yeah, you know, while we're talking

about your wife, I've got a question.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
How come your wife flew

all the way to war-torn Cordovia

just to get away from you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<p>
[people murmuring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<p>
That's not what happened.

She went to help people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
Or maybe she went to help herself

get away from her awful marriage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<p>
[audience gasping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
-Oh, was that too far?

-Oh-ho, you want to get into things?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<p>
-Well, I mean--

-No, no, no, let's get into things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<p>
Let's get real.

Everybody, BoJack wants to get real.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<p>
Cancel the Bubble Round.

Because we're getting real.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<p>
[production assistant sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<p>
Should we cut to commercial?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<p>
Would Homer cut away

from Odysseus's journey

just as he was being enticed

by the sirens' song?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:13" />

<p>
No?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<p>
Well, there you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<p>
Things are getting real out here.

Really real.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<p>
Really, really, really real!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<p>
{\an8}[audience member clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
-Uh, I'm not sure where you're going--

-Oh, no?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<p>
You knew

where you were going with my wife

that time you pulled over

by the side of the road.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
-You know, a week before we got married?

-Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
You want to talk about that, BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
You want to talk about the time when you,

my "good friend," kissed my wife?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
-No!

-Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
Did something

exciting just happen?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<p>
Because people on the app are,

and I quote, "losing their tits."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<p>
Oh, no, no, I've stumbled on to

a cancer support message board.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<p>
Okay, how do I...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
How did you know about that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
Well, there are roadside cameras

all along the PCH,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
I have a few friends

in the highway patrol,

and she told me, of course! We're married!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<p>
Wait, so you've known all this time?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<p>
Now this is television. Turn on the rain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<p>
Um, don't you think

you're pushing them too far?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<p>
I'll tell you when it's too far.

This is my art, goddamn it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<p>
I'm J. goddamn D.

goddamn Salinger, and I want rain!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<p>
[thunder rumbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<p>
All I ever wanted was to be your friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
And you treat me like a big joke.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<p>
You think I don't notice?

Why don't you like me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<p>
-Mr. Peanutbutter--

-No, tell me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<p>
-Because... I'm jealous.

-Oh.

-Of what? Diane?

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<p>
Of everything.

Everything comes so easy for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
Oh, and it doesn't for you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
You're a millionaire movie star

with a girlfriend who loves you,

acting in your dream movie.

What more do you want?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<p>
What else could

the universe possibly owe you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<p>
I want to feel good about myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<p>
The way you do.

And I don't know how.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<p>
I don't know if I can.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
Whoa, guys, this is getting

a little heavy, don't we think?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<p>
I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<p>
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<p>
Wow, um, I don't know

if I can forgive you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<p>
But I guess we'll find out

right after this break.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<p>
[audience cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
-Damn.

-Shut up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
[all cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<p>
I knew it. I knew this show would

bring us to the heights of human drama

more powerfully than literature

ever dreamed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
Now somebody go out and get me

a Red Bull and a banana fish sandwich.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<p>
On it. It's a perfect day for a Red Bull.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
Whoa-oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
-Mr. Peanutbutter!

-Oh, hey Wanda.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<p>
I'm only half paying attention

to whatever you two are arguing about

but it's killer.

Now all we need is a happy ending.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
I don't think we can just resolve

everything cleanly in a half-hour.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<p>
Uh, this is network television.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<p>
So resolving everything cleanly

in a half-hour is kind of what we do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<p>
You want to host a game show where

everyone feels bad at the end?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
You can get in your little car, drive to

Santa Monica and pitch it to AMC.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<p>
But these people want resolution, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
So you get your little butt back

on that stage and you resolve.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<p>
-Uh...

-[audience applauding]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
And we're back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<p>
You know, I did some thinking

over the break. BoJack--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<p>
-[electricity powers down]

-[audience gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<p>
-What's going on?

-Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
No! No! What's happening?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<p>
-[all chattering]

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
[electricity powers up]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<p>
Someone unplugged the main power line

and plugged in a George Foreman Grill.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<p>
Panini time. Hey, who unplugged--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
Todd! Goddamnit, step aside!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
Mia, good work.

You saved the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
You earned my respect... and this pen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<p>
-Oh, thank you.

-[all cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<p>
Aww.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
Oh, are we back? We're back!

Live television, folks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
You know, during the break,

my producers told me

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
I had to forgive BoJack

live on the air.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
[audience booing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
But I'm my own dog.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
And as my own dog, I decided

to forgive BoJack live on the air!

Bring it in, buddy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
-What?

-Really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

I applaud your forgiving nature,

but this guy kissed your wife.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
Wait, BoJack kissed Diane?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<p>
The only way to even the score

is if you get to kiss him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<p>
-Wait, what?

-You're right, it makes perfect sense.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
-Yeah, absolutely.

-No, it doesn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<p>
That way Diane and I will have

had the same experience.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<p>
It's the only way we can move past this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
Well, if it helps us move past this,

I guess...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<p>
[Daniel and audience] Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
[J.D.] Cue the Kiss Cam.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<p>
[love song playing over speakers]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
Oh, if only I'd had a Kiss Cam

for <i>Catcher In The Rye.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<p>
Well, just one more regret

on a long list of many.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<p>
Todd, there you are. You're missing

a pretty big moment out there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
I don't care. You said it yourself.

Without that pen, I'm totally worthless.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
Not for nothing, but you were worthless

before you didn't get the pen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
I really tried this time. I guess

I'll never really amount to anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
Well, maybe you just need

someone to believe in you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<p>
Wow, no one's ever

fallen for that!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
-What?

-You're so stupid!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<p>
You had the pen

and you just gave it to me?!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<p>
Oh, I can't believe that worked.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<p>
Oh, my God, look at your stupid face.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<p>
The pen is just a symbol.

It doesn't--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<p>
Yeah, said the girl

who doesn't have a pen right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<p>
Unbelievable. You are the most annoying,

immature, aggravating,

irritating, crazy-making...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
Oh, she was mad, all right. But kids?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<p>
That's the story of

how I met... this pen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<p>
Hey, get out of Hair and Makeup

and give me back my pen!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
I got your pen.

That means you respect me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<p>
-No it does not.

-Viva Todd-foolery!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<p>
Suck a dick, dumbshits.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<p>
-Hey! Hey, hey!

-[blows raspberry]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<p>
-[lively music playing over speakers]

-[audience cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<p>
Well, that stern but supple kiss

puts you over the top.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<p>
BoJack Horseman is tonight's winner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<p>
[dog howls]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<p>
-Well played, Jock-jam Door-slam.

-[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<p>
You've earned $500,000 for charity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<p>
You can walk away right now

or, and remember, this is for charity,

you can risk it all in

our Double or Nothing round.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
[audience clamoring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<p>
{\an8}I wanna risk it all!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />

<p>
All right. Now that's $500,000.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
If you get this question right,

you double that,

a million dollars for charity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:44" />

<p>
But if you get it wrong,

the charity gets nothing

and all the money will be set on fire

live here on our studio soundstage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
BoJack, for all the marbles:

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<p>
"Which famous actor

played the titular role

in the popular <i>Harry Potter</i>

film franchise?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<p>
-[audience] Oh.

-Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<p>
Yeah. I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<p>
When you're as famous as I am,

you meet so many people,

it's impossible to remember them all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<p>
Okay, I get what you're doing. Very funny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:13" />

<p>
Yeah. Oh, what is that guy's name?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<p>
You know, it's on the tip of my tongue?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
Are you serious right now?

Dude, this is for charity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<p>
-BoJack, we need an answer.

-Yeah, I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<p>
Gosh, I wanna say...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<p>
-Elijah Wood?

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<p>
{\an8}Elijah Wood?!
