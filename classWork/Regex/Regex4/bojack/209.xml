<timestamp data-time="00:00:05" />

<p>
[thunder rumbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:10" />

<p>
Sir, you can't send me to Vietnam.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<p>
[Nixon] I can do whatever I want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
I'm president of the goddamn

United States of America.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<p>
Isn't that right, Checkers?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
That's what it says

on your business cards.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
There are going to be riots

in the streets.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<p>
I'm Secretariat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
You think I'm afraid

of a few rioting hippies?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
Don't make me laugh. Ha-hoo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
Or whatever a laugh sounds like.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
Please, I'll do anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
You gotta send someone else

in my place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<p>
Hmm. Perhaps an arrangement can be...

arranged.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>I'm just an athlete. I'm no hero.</i>

<i>My brother Jeffretariat is the hero.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<p>
<i>He's fighting the Reds over in 'Nam,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
<i>which is necessary</i>

<i>to protect our way of life.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
<i>And another hero is President Nixon.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<p>
<i>He is one groovy dude.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<p>
[BoJack] Groovy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
[coughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<p>
What the hell are you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<p>
Sorry, Mommy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<p>
Don't you dare put that out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<p>
That is a perfectly good cigarette,

and you are going to finish it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
But I don't wanna.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
And I don't want to be

the mother of a quitter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<p>
Finish it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<p>
[coughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<p>
Jesus Christ, you can't even smoke

a cigarette right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<p>
Don't you dare cry,

don't you ever cry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<p>
You wanted this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<p>
Are you punishing me for smoking

or for stealing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<p>
I'm punishing you for being alive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:43" />

<p>
Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<p>
Uh, BoJack? You really shouldn't throw

a lit cigarette off the--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:48" />

<p>
[fire roaring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

<p>
Fine. I'll call 911.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<p>
{\an8}[♪♪]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:48" />

<p>
{\an8}The fire department got

everything under control,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<p>
{\an8}but the cable's out

for the neighborhood.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<p>
{\an8}I don't understand

what started the fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<p>
{\an8}Nobody knows where fires come from,

it's a mystery.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<p>
{\an8}Anyway, I am fired up

about my first day back on set.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<p>
{\an8}We're gonna finish

that big Nixon scene.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<p>
{\an8}We were just one shot away

before we went on hiatus.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<p>
{\an8}Yeah, I know.

You told me at breakfast.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<p>
{\an8}Why did you call me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:08" />

<p>
{\an8}Usually I talk to Diane

on the way to work,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<p>
{\an8}but she abandoned me to teach piano

in Cordovia or something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<p>
Oh. Well, glad you settled for me

because Diane wasn't available.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<p>
{\an8}You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna kill

in this Nixon scene.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
{\an8}BoJack gonna be in "da" house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
{\an8}In da White House.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<p>
What happened to da house set?

Da White House set?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<p>
{\an8}-Things changed a little.

-You cut the Nixon scene?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<p>
{\an8}The Nixon scene is the core

of the whole movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<p>
Where we see Secretariat

be morally corrupted

and get to look

into the real darkness of his soul.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
It's still all that,

except now it happens

while you give a Christmas present

to your nieces

and they hug you

while your butt is stuck in a chimney.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<p>
Is one of the nieces Nixon?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
{\an8}Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
{\an8}People don't want

all that controversial stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
But we were supposed to make

a gritty movie about the real Secretariat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
{\an8}-Warts and all.

-Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
{\an8}That's why they took the gay stuff

out of <i>A Beautiful Mind.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
Know that guy who spent 12 years

as a slave?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
They don't talk about the 60 years

he spent as a jerk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<p>
{\an8}-Kelsey, you're okay with this?

-Eh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
{\an8}That's showbiz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
{\an8}See, BoJack,

that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
{\an8}Good shrugging, kid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
{\an8}Yo! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
{\an8}That's the end of your name.

We need to talk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
{\an8}We'll meet in the supply closet

in one minute. Break!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<p>
Oh, okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<p>
Ooh, ow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<p>
Carolyn, when you're in the throes

of a very ugly divorce such as I am,

along with all that pain and degradation

comes a certain perfect clarity,

and right now that clarity is telling me

that you and I should get out of here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
Well, what do you mean,

"get out of here"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,

and I want you to be my partner in crime.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<p>
What? But I can't just leave Vigor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<p>
I've been here 20 years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
Who's gonna water the plants?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<p>
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<p>
I started doing it as an intern,

but then no one told me to stop,

so it's still kind of my job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
Carolyn,

you are my gritty, witty city kitty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
Things are so crazy

for me right now. I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<p>
Don't give me that, you want crazy.

"Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline song

and your second favorite

Gnarls Barkley song.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<p>
I don't want crazy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
I've got five episodes

of <i>The Good Wife </i>piled up on my DVR,

and I just want a night off

to enjoy them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
Well, if that's how you feel, I guess

I could just go to Vanessa Gekko.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
-[Carolyn] Gekko?!

-But I'd rather look at you all day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<p>
You're an amazing agent.

And you're bright, and you're fun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
And I think we could make something

really special.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<p>
We weren't doing anything!

We were just looking for closet supplies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<p>
Are you the person to talk to

about unclogging the toilet?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
Stuart, I'm your boss.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<p>
Okay, but you're the one

in the janitor's closet, so...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
-What, I'm the idiot?

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
[Diane] <i>The first thing you notice</i>

<i>about Sebastian St. Clair</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
<i>is that he speaks in paragraphs.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<p>
Even I can't believe

how much good we've done here,

and I'll believe almost anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
In the last six weeks,

we dug a new well, built a school,

and next month

the community center is doing <i>Seussical.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
There we go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
[Diane] <i>In his previous life,</i>

<i>Sebastian owned</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<p>
<i>a chain of high-end department stores.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
I want to stock up on muffs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
We're going to sell a lot of muffs

this winter. Huzzah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<p>
Diane, I lived a life

of power and luxury,

and then my picture

was in the newspaper.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<p>
-A real-life newspaper!

-Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
But I knew my life was empty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<p>
<i>At night I heard the cries</i>

<i>of children sick and dying.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<p>
<i>And I would scream into the night.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<p>
Shut up! Shut up, children!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
<i>But the phantom cries would not abate.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
And so I began my travels,

with little more than a compass,

a yearning for adventure,

and several crates full of unsold muffs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
I knew there were people out there

just waiting for my help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
Diane, this is Kinko.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<p>
I am Kinko.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<p>
In his language, it means,

orphan whose parents were murdered

by rebels and will die young,

probably from malaria.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
Hi, Kinko. I'm Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
It means,

my parents liked the show <i>Cheers.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
<i>Cheers! </i>Oh, you're good.

You're very good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
[Diane] <i>When Sebastian St. Clair says</i>

<i>you're good,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<p>
<i>you want to believe</i>

<i>that you really are.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
<i>That you, like Sebastian, are part</i>

<i>of something bigger than just yourself.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
<i>And for a moment,</i>

<i>you feel like you are.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<p>
[Sebastian] Oh, Kinko made a mess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
Now I finally realize that a triple hug is

way more valuable than a Triple Crown.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
And cut. Neat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
-Let's break for lunch.

-[kids] Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<p>
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<p>
I had to touch three children today,

and one of them was sticky.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
Yeah, it was you.

Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
-BoJack, there's nothing we can do.

-No, this isn't you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<p>
I've seen everything you've done.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<p>
Your films are challenging and gritty,

and they're great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
I'm not just saying that

because they're full of lesbians.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<p>
Look, even if I wanted to finish

that Nixon scene,

we don't have an Oval Office set.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<p>
There's one at the Nixon Library

in Yorba Linda.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<p>
Why on earth do you know that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
In season three of <i>Horsin' Around,</i>

the horse got elected president

and we shot on location.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
We can sneak into the library

and get the shot, guerilla-style.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<p>
Once Turteltaub sees it,

he'll love it,

and we can make the movie

we both want to make.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<p>
-Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.

-All right!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<p>
Did they really make

your character president?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<p>
Only for season three.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
In season four, it turned out

it was all a dream.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
They called my airplane <i>Air Horse One.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<p>
And the vice president was

a hip-hop zebra named Zebro.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<p>
-Come on.

-It wasn't our best season.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<p>
But on the bright side,

was not our worst.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<p>
<i>Step one, we go to the Nixon Library...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
<i>and steal the scale model.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<p>
[man as Nixon] Welcome to my library.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<p>
I'm Nixon. [chuckles].

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
[in normal voice] Yeah, you know,

some people say I look like Nixon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<p>
Not because he's my dad or anything.

That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
But if you have any questions about Nixon,

I'd be happy to answer them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
Yeah, I have a question. Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<p>
Is that the lighted exit sign

from Nixon's boyhood home?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<p>
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<p>
-Is that...

-Here we go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
...the handicapped drinking fountain

he used in the White House?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<p>
No, just a normal drinking fountain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<p>
-Hang on.

-One more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
-Is that the smoke alarm--?

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
[chuckles nervously]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
{\an8}So the Oval Office is right here,

next to the men's room.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
{\an8}I remember because season three

of<i> Horsin' Around </i>was a big cocaine year.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
{\an8}All the pressures of being president.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<p>
-I don't see how we'll pull this off.

-We're gonna need a crack team.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
First, we gotta get

the best lock-pick in the city.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
-Not interested.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<p>
<i>The second best lock-pick in the city.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<p>
-No way I'm doing that.

-Got it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
<i>A lock-pick.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Todd, can you pick locks?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
-Kind of.

-Great. You're in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
<i>We'll need an expert cat burglar.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

All right, <i>Good Wife,</i>

<p>
[BoJack] Hey, Princess Carolyn!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
Kelsey and I are gonna break

into the Nixon library

to steal a shot

for our Secretariat movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
It's a super-sneaky, kooky caper

that stands to benefit you in no way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
Are you in?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
[man] Hey! Shut up down there!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<p>
-[BoJack] You shut up!

-[man] Make me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<p>
[BoJack] Hey, you got a problem?

Take it up with my agent,

your downstairs neighbor

Princess Carolyn.

</p>

<p>
Hey, Chicago! Al Capone, deep dish.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
What does Ethan Hawke know?

We'll find out tonight. Da Bears.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<p>
BoJack, I'd love to help you out,

but I'm super-busy recording promos

for television's

highest-rated new game show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
-We can probably do it without you.

-This next one's for Seattle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
Hey, Seattle! Space Needle, Starbucks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>
What does Ethan Hawke know?

We'll find out tonight. Rain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
It's too bad though because I could

really bring a lot to this project.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
The more I think about it,

Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<p>
It's just a single on Secretariat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
Hey, Waco, Texas! Terrible tragedy.

What does Ethan Hawke know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<p>
-We'll find out tonight. So sorry.

-You know what? Forget I even asked.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
-Twist my arm, why don't you? I'll do it.

-Okay.

you've been a model prisoner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<p>
I'm glad I served my time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
But now I'm ready to move on with my life

and get back to doing small roles

in critically-acclaimed films

and television shows.

<p>
I need your help with a break-in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
BoJack, I've been out of prison

for two minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
What took you so long?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<p>
[tires squealing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<p>
Kelsey, Mr. Peanutbutter and I

are gonna break into the library.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
But the problem is,

the place is crawling with cops.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<p>
They're on high alert

because some idiot

stole this model last night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<p>
Yeah, nice work, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
[laughs] Who am I kidding?

I can't stay mad at you. You're adorable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<p>
Look at your big saucer eyes.

I can go swimming in them!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
-Totally.

-Now, we need to lose the cops.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<p>
The rest of you will create a diversion

by breaking into the only other place

in Yorba Linda of cultural significance:

the Discount Fine Art Gallery

in the strip mall,

between the tanning salon

and the adult bookstore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
Once you set off the alarm,

all the cops will go there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<p>
[mimicking siren wails and engine revving]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
Now, things could get ugly.

One of you is very likely to die.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<p>
-Possibly Alan.

-Why possibly Alan?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
Well, you are the guy

none of us knows that well.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
I just came to fix your cable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
Alan, you already know too much.

You're a part of this now, like it or not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<p>
-But--

-Hey, you think you could keep it down?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
I'm reading a script

and I'm having trouble focusing,

so now my notes are

gonna be confusing and vague.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
We're almost done.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<p>
I know you're having fun

with your police cars,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
I just wish you would have asked

before you invited these people over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<p>
-I live here, too.

-You're right. I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<p>
And can you at least let Alan

fix the cable before he dies?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<p>
I can't die. I'm endangered!

I'm concerned you're spending

<p>
Remember, you're supposed

to be writing about me.

</p>

<p>
Sure, but isn't this why we're here?

To help these people?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
I'm here to help these people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<p>
You're here to help me help them

by writing a book about me

so people back home will give money

to my foundation.

<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<p>
Great.

</p>

to come out of this alive.

<p>
Why do you all keep saying that?

<p>
Why can't we all assume we're gonna

make it out alive and go from there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
Alan, we've got enough problems without

worrying about your imminent death.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<p>
Can't we just all shut up and do this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
Why does everything have to be

a big, complicated mess?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
Like,

look at this Thomas Kinkade painting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
It's simple.

Yeah? What, another leftist screed

<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
-Uh...

-Or is it about how he had

an illegitimate son,

and the son never knew who his dad was,

but always had a hunch it was Nixon,

and then that son grew up to be

the security guard at the Nixon Library?

<p>
Well, if that's true, how come you don't

have an actor here to play Nixon?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<p>
[as Nixon] I'm Nixon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
The way you're feeling

about your dead brother is how I feel

about the son I'll never know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<p>
But I look at the moon and so does he.

That's how I know we're connected.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<p>
And I'm Checkers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<p>
[Kelsey] All right, so, BoJack,

you've been told

that your brother, Jeffretariat,

the one Nixon sent to Vietnam

in your place, is dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<p>
You're feeling the weight of that guilt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
And the tears start to flow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
And the tears start to flow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<p>
Oh. I don't cry in front of other people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
Well, you need to.

This is the emotional climax of the movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
Yeah, okay, but I don't cry in front

of other people. I can't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
Really, never? Come on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<p>
What if someone tells you

they'll take you to the park,

and they keep talking about the park

and all the fun you'll have,

but then... [sobs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
But then they don't take you to the park.

I need a second.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
Well, I'm sorry, I can't do it.

I didn't know you wanted me to cry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
Can you give us the room, please?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<p>
There's a park right outside

we can hang out at.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
-Oh!

-Oh, we can't, the sprinklers are on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
Ah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<p>
Well, another beautiful, serene day

in magical fantasy-painting world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<p>
Queen Princess Carolyn, if I may,

I have some exciting news.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<p>
I just landed a new client.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<p>
-The mill owner!

-Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<p>
We're doing a three-picture deal

about his waterwheel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<p>
-Wait, you're making deals here?

-I'll say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<p>
I'm now the biggest agent

in the entire idyllic New England village.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
It's like you don't even read

the idyllic New England village trades.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
What? No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<p>
You're polluting my perfect serene

dream life. Why is this happening?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
I don't know. It's your fantasy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
But if you ask me, I don't think

you want perfect and serene

and enough time to catch up

on <i>The Good Wife.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
Stop kidding yourself,

Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
If you really wanted the simple life,

you'd have a simple life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
Oh, my God. I gotta get out of here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
[sing-song] Bye!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
Hey. Yeah, I got rid of her.

Now this place is all mine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
Get your demo guys together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
Let's tear this old Tudor down

and put up some condos! [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
[Margo laughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
This isn't just for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<p>
It's for John Carroll Lynch,

C.C.H. Pounder,

and all the other character actors

who live in lucrative obscurity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<p>
The blood I spill today is for us all!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
I'm character actress Margo Martindale!

[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<p>
Yeah, I'm going to go

with Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
[laughing and grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<p>
Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<p>
[cell phone ringtone]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
-Hello?

-Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
There you are!

I've been trying to call you all week.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
-Yeah, the coverage in Cordovia is--

<i>-Diane, Diane.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<p>
Listen, I gotta tell you:

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<p>
I'm sorry I gave you such

a hard time about your trip.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
The truth is,

I really am so proud of you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
<i>A lot of people talk big,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
<i>but you're actually out there</i>

<i>helping people.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
<i>You're the real deal, Diane.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<p>
-Yeah...

-How is it there? Is it amazing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<p>
It's... good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
It's hard, but it's good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
I miss you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
I miss you, too, but I promise,

these six months are gonna fly by.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
Yeah. How's the game show going?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
Oh, shit, I completely forgot I'm supposed

to be hosting a game show right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<p>
[upbeat dance music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<p>
[caws]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<p>
I gotta go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
[Diane] <i>And that's when you realize</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<p>
<i>that the book you've been writing</i>

<i>in your head</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<p>
<i>is never actually going to be a book,</i>

<i>so you stop--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<p>
I know what you're gonna say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<p>
I'm a dumb sitcom actor

who's in over his head.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
I'm sorry that I thought I could do this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<p>
And I'm sorry I made you come here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<p>
I'm sorry for everything.

I don't know what I'm doing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<p>
BoJack, sit down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
You've just been told your brother is dead

and that it's your fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<p>
But this moment is bigger than that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
This is the moment

that Secretariat stops running.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
Because this is the moment you realize

something inside you is broken,

and it can never be fixed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
We got it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<p>
Really? I didn't cry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<p>
You didn't have to.

Turteltaub's gonna love this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<p>
-Oh. All right.

-Thanks for talking me into this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
Just so you know, I'm really glad

we're making this movie together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<p>
-Didn't know I had it in me, did you?

-No, I knew.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<p>
Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<p>
[crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<p>
-Hold the elevator, please.

-Coming in?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
-I'm all in.

-Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<p>
Mommy, it's nearly Christmas.

Where's Uncle Secretariat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
He had to go win a race

against the Russians.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<p>
But maybe, if he runs really fast...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<p>
-Hey, where's Kelsey?

-Oh, yeah, funny story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<p>
Turns out you two knuckleheads

snuck out last night

and got that shot

I told you not to get for the scene

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<p>
-that's not in the movie anymore.

-Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<p>
Silly me, I didn't like that.

So I fired her ass.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<p>
-What?

-We got a movie to finish, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
So, go get in costume,

get your butt up that chimney,

and do your thing, Hamlet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<p>
Just maybe,

all we have to do is believe!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:27" />

<p>
[slurping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:37" />

<p>
What are you doing here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:38" />

<p>
Hey, is it cool if I crash here

for a couple nights?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:42" />

<p>
I didn't know where else to go.
