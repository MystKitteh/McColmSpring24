<p>
...fucker!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<p>
-So, we have some options.

-Yeah, a lot of options to discuss.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<p>
-You know I love you.

-That's not what this is about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
We always agreed

we didn't want kids, unless--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
A streetwise but soulful teen

needed somewhere to live

as he waited

for his Juilliard audition.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
We'd support his dancing and let him

stay in the guest room, right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
-But a baby? Are you--?

-It's not about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
There's no "I" in uterus,

there's only "us."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
And "U," and another "U,"

but that's the "U" that's in "us,"

so I already said that "U."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<p>
The point is,

I'm going to be here for you, 24/7.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<p>
Two hundred and forty-seven percent,

that's how "there for you" I'll be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
-Whatever you decide...

-What we decide, because this is--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<p>
Definitely. This is a conversation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
Let's both say what we want

at the same time on three.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
-Okay.

-One, two--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
On three or after three?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<p>
How could I say it "on three"?

I'll be saying "three."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
-Okay. Okay.

-One, two, three...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
-Abortion.

-Get an abortion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<p>
Oh, no. We said different things.

<p>
{\an8}I would seriously like to know

what crawled up your butt,

<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
{\an8}made a home for itself in your butt,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
{\an8}started a family, lived a fruitful life,

and then died up your butt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm getting an abortion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
Whoa, that takes me back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
I had more than my share of abortions

in the '90s.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
I didn't get them, I paid for them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
{\an8}I really hope all those women

actually got the abortions,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
{\an8}and didn't just keep my money.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
{\an8}Diane, are you tweeting for pop starlet

Sextina Aquafina right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm trying to. Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
{\an8}Because her account

just tweeted out to 40 million followers,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
{\an8}"I'm getting an abortion."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
{\an8}What? No--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<p>
She--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<p>
Oh, balls.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<p>
The tweet heard round the world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<p>
Sextina Aquafina says,

"I'm getting an abortion."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
And the world says, "Whaaa?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<p>
If it's happening,

we're gonna talk about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<p>
It's time for Tom's Rant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<p>
Is Twitter an appropriate forum

to be discussing a sensitive issue

like abortion?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<p>
Wouldn't a better forum be nowhere?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<p>
Wait, does that say "Tom Srant"?

Why does that say Tom Srant?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
I clearly said--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
Randy, don't look at Jessica.

This is on you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<p>
Diane, VIM is hanging on by a thread

and only barely scraping by

because of clients like Sextina.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<p>
Hey! Heard you pulled the trigger

on the Big Bear condo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<p>
Great investment.

We are not on the edge of complete ruin.

<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<p>
We are on the edge of complete ruin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
I think if I explain it to her

and apologize, she'll understand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<p>
Because she's so understanding?

This is a teenage pop star.

<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<p>
Ugh. So imagine my surprise

when I'm in the middle of a performance

for Gaddafi's cousin on his yacht

and I'm in a giant champagne flute

singing "Left Titty"

and everyone starts to look

at their phones and look at me,

because I am apparently aborting a baby

I do not have.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
So I had them turn their boat into a car

and drive me here to fire someone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
-I think that's me.

-Great. You're fired, Glasses.

<p>
Oh. Oh!

<p>

Nicki Minaj tweeted at you

a face with heart eyes.

like Sextina.

<p>
-You're trending like crazy.

-I'm trending?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
Most women who go through this

never talk about it

because it's so stigmatized.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
The fact that you're coming out like this

is huge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<p>
It would be, if you were

actually getting an abortion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
So what you're saying is,

maybe I <i>am </i>getting an abortion?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
Well, no, because you're not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
Yeah, but if you did,

this would make you a cultural icon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<p>
Glasses, you're un-fired.

I'm getting an abortion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<p>
-Well...

-I gotta go on talk shows.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
If I can make one woman

feel a little less alone,

then it's all worth it, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
Yeah...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
And if I can make a million women

buy my album,

then it's definitely all worth it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<p>
Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
-Diane, take the yes.

-Okay.

<p>
Sextina Aquafina, you are now the face

of the pro-choice movement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
-Now let's get you informed.

-Hey! Uh, what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<p>
[crowd chattering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<p>
So, before the procedure,

you'll need to look at an ultrasound

and listen to the heartbeat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
Or heartbeats, if you're having a litter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
Why does she have to listen

to the heartbeat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<p>
It's the law. Also, by law,

I have to tell you that at one month,

your puppies have a favorite color

and that color may be blue.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<p>
-That can't be true.

-By law, I have to tell you that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
Also, before your procedure,

you'll need to watch

20 hours of cute puppy videos

as Sarah McLachlan's

"I Will Remember You" plays softly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<p>
Don't worry, Diane, I will watch

the cute puppy videos for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<p>
-It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

-No, she has to watch the videos.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
Don't worry, Diane, we will watch

the cute puppy videos together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<p>
-No, she has to watch them alone.

-Diane, I have some terrible news.

<p>
How do you get in the head

of a war criminal?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
You know,

I don't think of him as a war criminal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<p>
I just think of him as a person

who had a funny accent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<p>
Totally. I think I'm getting

the hang of all this now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
You won last night, the other guy

won tonight, maybe I'll win next time.

<p>
Yikes.

Look, man, you're not gonna be next.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<p>
This will sound dumb

coming out of my mouth, but it's true.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
So Jurj, Bread, Mitt, those are names.

Like real names.

<p>
Lernernerner DiCarpricorn, that's a name.

<p>
-BoJack, not a name.

-Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
I figured they would, like,

tell you this stuff.

<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
You're the Fifth Man. You get it, right?

</p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
-Is that right?

-That is exactly correct, A Ryan,

but I am very excited for this opportunity

to put a face on this important issue.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<p>
One out of three women

will have an abortion in her life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<p>
That sounds crazy high to me,

I don't buy it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
I wanted to destigmatize the experience

for all women out there,

so I'm dropping a new single.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
-What?

- <i>♪ Surprise! ♪</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<p>
-New single?

-Just relax.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<p>
Crack an egg on your head,

feel the yolk drip down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
America, get your uteruses turnt,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
'cause this song is called

"Get Dat Fetus Kill Dat Fetus."

</p>

Oh, dear.

Christ, stop the tape.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
Glasses, you did this.

You empowered me to tell my story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<p>
I think the tone might be a little severe?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<p>
Look, when you get an abortion,

you can express yourself however you want,

but this is about my body and my choices,

and my choice

is to be a totally insane badass.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<p>
Ugh! I <i>am </i>getting an abortion.

You're not even really pregnant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
So? This is show business.

"Brrap brrap. Pew pew."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<p>
{\an8}"Brrap brrap. Pew pew."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<p>
{\an8}A daring battle cry from

the self-appointed New Voice of Choice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
{\an8}But has the concept of women

having choices gone too far?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<p>
{\an8}We've assembled this diverse panel

of white men in bow ties

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
{\an8}to talk about abortion. Gentlemen?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<p>
{\an8}Tom, this is not just a woman's issue.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm a man, but if I got pregnant,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
{\an8}would I put my life on hold

for a child I didn't want? Yes, I would.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<p>
{\an8}I can say that with confidence,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
{\an8}because I will never have to make

that decision, so I'm unbiased.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
{\an8}-Does this video glamorize abortion?

-Very possibly, Tom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<p>
{\an8}Millennials today think everything is NBD.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<p>
{\an8}NBD of course stands for No BD,

referring to B.D. Wong,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<p>
{\an8}who teens think is a very big deal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<p>
{\an8}So if something's not BD,

it means it's not a big deal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
{\an8}-These days, abortions are not BD.

-Are abortions even necessary?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<p>
{\an8}I heard a theory that if a woman

really has an unwanted pregnancy,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<p>
{\an8}the body has a way to break the fetus down

into gas particles

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
{\an8}and then she can just fart it out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
{\an8}Where did you hear this intriguing

"fart it out" theory?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<p>
{\an8}-I don't remember. Maybe the Bible?

-Thank you for clarifying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<p>
{\an8}Next up, Jurj Clooners

is making audiences cry

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
{\an8}in his new film, but his latest prank

might make you... think?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
[groaning]

Jurj. He likes pranks, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<p>
I'll prank him. I'll prank him real good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<p>
We'll need to draw him out.

What do A-list actors like?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<p>
Stretch limos? Nannies?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
Flying their private jets

to disaster areas so they can "help out"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
Yeah, limos. We'll get a limo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
I'll need one of those caps,

I'll be the driver.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<p>
I'll pick him up,

and he'll be all like, "I'm Jurj, I suck,"

and then I'll be all, "Surprise,"

and hit him with a bat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
Pranked!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<p>
It really doesn't seem like a prank

as much as you hitting him with a bat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<p>
Yeah, it's a bad prank on purpose

to show how stupid pranks are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<p>
-That's the point.

-Is that the point?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
I'm working on levels here, man.

To the limousine repository.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<p>
[paparazzi yelling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
[with accent]

Good afternoon, Mr. Clooners.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
Hey, man, just one sec,

my publicist is right behind me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
Of course. Bring the publicist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
-Oh, shit.

-What's that, driver?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
I said, "Auschwitz."

You're the Nazi who played Yahtzee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
Right, well, anyway, we're going

to the AOL-Time-Warner-PepsiCo-Viacom

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<p>
Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-Trader Joe's

Auditorium

for the Image Choice Spirit Awards.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<p>
Uh... okay, yes, ma'am.

Here I go. Driving, driving.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
You don't need to talk,

you can just drive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
Actually, can we make a couple stops?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<p>
I am totally out of toilet paper,

so if you could find a Rite Aid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
You have to go in and buy the TP for me.

I'll get mobbed by fans if I go in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
Just pick out something

extra soft for my tushy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<p>
-I don't know

-Do as he says, driver.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<p>
-Chop chop.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<p>
My concern is that you're

actually giving the pro-life movement

something to latch onto

as an example of--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>
Oh, my God, you are so boring.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<p>
Can I abort talking to you right now?

Abort.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<p>
-You need to stop and think--

-Or what? You gonna sic Fido on me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<p>
I am just here for emotional support.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:32" />

<p>
Can you let it go?

I don't want to have to ask you again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<p>
I really think we have the chance

to say something here,

and all we're saying

is "Pshew pshew pow."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
-What is that?

-What are you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<p>
That's the gun sounds, from the song.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
Uh. Do you mean, "Brrap brrap pew pew"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<p>
Yeah, that's what I did. "Pshow, kapow."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<p>
-That's not what a gun sounds like.

-Prrow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<p>
-Pshow, kapow!

-Bop!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:53" />

<p>
-Brrap brrap pew pew!

-Ppew, ping!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<p>
Can everyone please

stop making gun sounds?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
It is really freaking me out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<p>
My point is,

everyone's listening to you now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<p>
Soon people are gonna get bored

and move onto the next thing

and you'll hate yourself

that you weren't able to make a difference

when you had the chance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
Believe me,

it happens sooner than you think.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<p>
Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<p>
Hi. I'm A Ryan Sea--

[screaming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<p>
Okay, we're here, finally. Get out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<p>
Ooh, can we make one more stop?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<p>
I just remembered

we left my wife back at the house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />

<p>
Can we go back? Pwease?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<p>
Driver? The man said, "Pwease."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<p>
That's it. Enough.

I am not your driver. It is I, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
[gasping]

BoJack? What are you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
I was gonna prank Jurj

by hitting him with this bat,

but you got into the car because,

apparently, you are a two-timing liar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<p>
What's the thing with the bat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<p>
BoJack, this is not a good look on you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<p>
All this time,

I thought you believed in me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<p>
This is why your clients win every year.

You represent everyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<p>
It has nothing to do with whether

you're a good publicist or not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
I am a marvelous publicist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<p>
Not to me. You're doing great work

for this asshole who loves pranks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<p>
You're pranking him right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<p>
Yeah, with a bad prank

to show how stupid pranks are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
Seems a little convoluted,

which is actually a trademark

of a great prank.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
Well played, sir.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
No, it's a bad prank.

That's my point. Pranks are dumb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<p>
We're late, and I won't keep going

round and round with you on this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<p>
Publicists have many clients.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<p>
Not my publicist. You're fired.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<p>
Are you kidding?

Who fires Ana Spanakopita?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
I do. I just did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
[scoffing] Who's gonna set up

your press appearances?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<p>
Your hopeless agent? Your idiot sidekick?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<p>
Not your problem.

Get the hell out of my limo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
'Cause I gotta pick up

a bachelorette party in 30 minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<p>
{\an8}Sextina, welcome to the program.

Can I get a "pew pew" for the fans?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
{\an8}-Tom, abortion is a very serious subject.

-Yes, very serious, I agree.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<p>
{\an8}I want to tell the real story

about abortion,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<p>
{\an8}show America what it's really about,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
{\an8}which is why your girl Sextina Aquafina

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
{\an8}is gonna have her abortion

live on television.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<p>
{\an8}What what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
{\an8}Pay-per-view, chitches.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<p>
-What?

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
"Pay-per-view, chitches."

Brrap brrap, pew pew, ka-ching ka-ching.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<p>
How are you going to have

an abortion on live TV

when you're not even

really having an abortion?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<p>
-Duh, we'll just <i>Argo </i>that shit.

-What does that mean?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<p>
Yeah, yeah. Fake abortion.

Movie magic, like in <i>Argo.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:13" />

<p>
That is not what happened in <i>Argo.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<p>
If we're gonna do this,

we got to be real tasteful.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<p>
Yeah, only the best for my abortion.

All class.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
John Carpenter

can do the practical effects.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<p>
-He owes me a favor.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<p>
We'll book Eddie Redmayne as the fetus.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<p>
Are you hearing yourselves?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<p>
We're not going to fake an abortion

on live TV.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:32" />

<p>
Obviously, we'll pre-tape it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
Then put a little box in the corner

of the screen that says "Live."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
You don't think

this is incredibly disrespectful

to the women who actually get abortions?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
Not if we do it tasteful.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<p>
Diane, this is what the client wants.

Stop making it about you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<p>
I'm not making it about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<p>
-I am so tired of you creating problems.

-I'm not--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
I'm sorry you're so fertile

and in a sexually active,

loving relationship

and now you don't want a family.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<p>
-I'm sure that's really hard for you.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>
Uh... if this is not about me anymore,

then I'mma go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<p>
Y'all figure your shit out

and get back at me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:07" />

<p>
Where's that ZZ Top mofo at?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<p>
Can a chitch

get a parking validation or what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<p>
Is there something you want to say to me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
I have given everything to get where I am,

and I am not about to throw all that away.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<p>
She wants an abortion?

I'm getting her an abortion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<p>
-You know this is bullshit.

-It's all bullshit, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<p>
That's the gig. And you're not good enough

at this job to be too good for this job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<p>
I won't be a part of this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<p>
[groaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<p>
Yo, Beardo, where did you go?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
I need to get my parking validation did,

or I cannot leave.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<p>
Y'all's trippin' if you think

Sextina Aquafina

is paying $15 for parking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<p>
All right, new publicist.

What do you got for me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
Secretariat was an athlete, right?

And you used to be an athlete.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<p>
What? No, I didn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<p>
You didn't play baseball and football?

Oh, um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
You know, I think I Googled the wrong guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
-Did you think I was Bo Jackson?

-This idea I know you're going to like.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<p>
You know that car wash on Alvarado?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<p>
They need someone to dress up

like a gorilla and spin a sign.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<p>
Why would I do that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<p>
Anything that gets your face

out there, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<p>
How does it get my face out there

dressed like a gorilla?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
Maybe that one's a dud,

but hey, you think Lou Bega

knocked it out of the park

with "Mambo Number One"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<p>
-No, but he kept at it.

-[groaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
-[crowd chattering]

-[babies crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<p>
I'm making things all about me?

I'm the one who's having an abortion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<p>
-It's ridiculous.

-They're completely morally bankrupt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
I agree with you, 247 percent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
I just wrote "morally bankrupt"

on this form.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
You were right to do that.

This form is being very nosy right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<p>
Why did I even take that job?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<p>
You were going through a rough time,

Princess Carolyn wanted to help you

and she offered you the job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
Which she should not have done.

So morally bankrupt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<p>
Okay, yeah, that was nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<p>
But still,

she is putting her company's bottom line

before the very real damage

that bottle-nosed maniac

is doing every time

she gets on the news and--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<p>
[gasping]

That's it, the news.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
I gotta take the high road,

go on the news and rat those suckers out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<p>
Is that really a good idea?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<p>
It is if you think it is,

because I am here to support you

no matter what,

but maybe it isn't the best idea?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<p>
Like, if that idea were a Dillon brother

maybe it's a Kevin, not a Matt?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
Someone has to tell the world

that Sextina is a total fraud.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
[girl] You know Sextina Aquafina?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
-Oh. Yeah, I mean, I work with her.

-Oh. She is so cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
Sextina's music makes me feel strong,

like I can do anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
It doesn't offend you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
What about the part where she says,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<p>
"I hope and pray to God

my little fetus has a soul

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
'cause I want it to feel pain

when I eject it from my hole"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
It's a joke.

You get that it's a joke, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
Well, obviously.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
Do you think she actually wants

to shoot her fetus with a gun?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
-No, I get it.

-Getting an abortion is scary.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<p>
With all the protesters out front,

how you have to listen

to the heartbeat and all that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
When you can joke about it,

it makes it less scary, you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
[sighing]

Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
[nurse]

Diane?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
Ana?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<p>
I won't be working with Jurj anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<p>
I let him know this morning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<p>
First he thought I was doing

a really good prank,

but eventually I think he understood.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<p>
You dropped Jurj?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
Jurj Clooners?

Sexiest Man in America Jurj Clooners?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<p>
Jurj is easy. Everyone loves him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
I've got a master's degree in Publicist,

it's time to put that to use.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
I dropped all my other clients.

You're the underdog.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
I want to put all my attention on you

and get you that Oscar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<p>
So nobody else, huh? Good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
Just all your hopes and dreams

pinned on me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
Somehow beating the odds

and winning the highest possible accolade

in an actor's career.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
-I know we can do it.

-Just me, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
Wow, that's actually. That--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<p>
Is someone standing on my windpipe?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
Let's just get Jurj on the phone so we--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<p>
No, BoJack. I believe in you, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
Whoa, Ana, what are you--?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
-Oh, boy.

-Shh... It's okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<p>
-When you fired me, it was thrilling.

-Oh. Ana...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<p>
Nobody talks to me like that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
It reminded me that I work for you,

and I liked that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<p>
Okay, but--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
Do you like that?

Being in control? Being the star?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<p>
You're my star, BoJack. My shining star.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<p>
-But don't you ever...

-Ow, too tight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
-...try to screw me again.

-Ouch! Oh, please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
-Do you understand?

-Yes. God, yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<p>
Good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
I'll see you tomorrow bright and early.

You have my undivided attention now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<p>
-Uh...

-[door opens, closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
[doctor]

<i>How are you feeling, Sextina?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<p>
[Sextina] <i>A little queasy</i>

<i>but on the whole, wonderful.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
[doctor] <i>Good. Now, I do accept tips.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<p>
-That was surprisingly tasteful.

-And educational, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<p>
Yeah. Weirdly educational.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<p>
I actually learned a lot about abortion,

and I just had an abortion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<p>
-How are you feeling?

-I feel shitty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
I mean, physically.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
I'm glad I did it,

but mostly I just felt old.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
There were all these teenagers there.

Twenty-somethings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />

<p>
I know from the outside, it might seem

like I should be ready for kids,

but I can't--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<p>
Diane, you don't need

to explain anything to anyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
[phone buzzing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<p>
-Sextina. Great job, we did it.

<i>-Yeah, so, little wrinkle.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<p>
I've been having a lot of sex, you know,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
'cause I'm a sexual creature

and dolphins do have sex for pleasure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<p>
I just found out

I got knocked up for real.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<p>
-What?

-And I think I want to keep it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<p>
But that might be a little confusing

to my fans,

since they just saw me

get the old scoopity doopity?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<p>
Okay, we're gonna handle this.

Meet us at the office in 20 minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:13" />

<p>
First thing is we gotta get her

out of town before she starts to show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:17" />

<p>
Yeah, we'll send her to that farm

where celebrities go to disappear,

where Chad Michael Murray

and Thora Birch went.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<p>
Film a bunch of music videos now,

and then--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<p>
Release them over the next year

so it seems like she's still around.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:29" />

<p>
Then when she comes back,

we'll say she adopted a baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<p>
[Carolyn] People are going to love that.

[Diane] Yeah. Everyone loves a baby.
