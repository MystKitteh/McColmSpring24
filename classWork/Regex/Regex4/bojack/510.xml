<p>
What troubles you, Sister?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
It's the woman who came from the water.

She's been in our care for two years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
She hasn't spoken a word

and spends her days in a fog.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
Have you been steadfast in your prayers?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
I have. And yet,

her condition does not improve.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<p>
"And yet"? Is prayer but a bargain?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
Is it for <i>you </i>to present terms

to the Lord?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
No, Mother. I just--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<p>
You seek a sign from God.

Should He seek <i>less </i>from you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<p>
Take the woman to the seaside

tomorrow after Matins.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<p>
Prove your faith to Him

that He might reveal His glory to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
Yes, Mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<p>
Can you feel that on your feet?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
That's water. Water.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<p>
This is hopeless! I want to help you,

but I don't even know who you are!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
I look at your face and think

you could be literally anyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<p>
Are you a federal judge? A Russian spy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<p>
-A proud Southern matriarch?

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<p>
Bo... BoJack!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<p>
-What?

-BoJack!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<p>
-What are you saying? I don't--

-BoJack! BoJack! BoJack!

{\an8}-Come on, get up. We're gonna be late.

-How have I gained weight?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:40" />

<p>
{\an8}Spent two weeks in a hospital

hooked up to a feeding tube.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<p>
You drank milkshakes.

That's not a feeding tube.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:44" />

<p>
It's basically a feeding tube.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<p>
{\an8}How many do you take a day?

Are you in that much pain right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:49" />

<p>
-I'm about to be. Reviews are out.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>"Philbert </i>is an astonishment,

{\an8}with Horseman bringing surprising depth

to the eponymous character."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<p>
"Surprising depth"?

God, they always gotta slant it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<p>
Why can't it just be "depth"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<p>
I'd hate to see you after a bad review.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:04" />

<p>
{\an8}Oh, and I bet "eponymous"

was supposed to be a pun on "pony."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<p>
Wait. There's a part about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<p>
"Gina Cazador also appears

as Sassy Malone."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<p>
Wow, I've never been mentioned

in a review before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
"Her restrained performance

crackles with nuance and power."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<p>
{\an8}Damn, look at me-- in two sentences.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, don't let it go to your head.

Probably just because you're a good actor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<p>
Anyway, I got you something

for the premiere party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<p>
{\an8}-These are beautiful, BoJack.

-Well, don't let it go to your head.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
It's because you visited me

in the hospital every day,

and I got used to having you around,

and it turns out I like you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<p>
Uh-oh. I let them go to my head.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
[elevator dings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
{\an8}"What separates <i>Philbert</i>

is the character's vulnerability.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
This is not the sad man

as suave and cynical anti-hero,

but a barely scabbed-over wound

of a person."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<p>
{\an8}"Barely scabbed-over."

Congratulations.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
You're the one

who took a stock bad-boy detective

and made him into a wound.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<p>
{\an8}Me? No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>-You're coming to the premiere party?</i>

-Already on my way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
{\an8}My apartment is a two-hour drive

from everywhere.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
{\an8}Seven miles, two hours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
-How is that possible?

-Honk, honk!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, that'll give you plenty of time

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
{\an8}to come up with a few spontaneous remarks

for the red carpet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
-[Diane] <i>Oh, do I have to do that?</i>

-Look, I gotta go. You'll be great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
-Just be charmingly effusive. Be yourself.

<i>-I can't be both of those things at once!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
-Can I help you?

-Abel Ziegler.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<p>
I saw the trailer

for your new show <i>Philbert,</i>

and I think you oughta see this. [slurps]

<p>
"What did the clam say to the crab

at the undersea ball?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<p>
I think you know why I'm here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
Oh, fish.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, buddy, these past few months,

you have been inappropriate

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<p>
{\an8}with every person

who's come to our apartment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<p>
{\an8}-[Henry] <i>I want to be inside you.</i>

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
{\an8}Henry Fondle, you <i>are </i>inside of me.

You always have been.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<p>
{\an8}But there's nowhere else I can take you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<p>
[Henry] <i>Let's get down to business.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
{\an8}You want me to take you to work?

No way!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>-Oh, yes!</i>

-No!

<p>
<i>-Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<p>
I need you to be

on your best behavior today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<p>
<i>That is the stuff I like.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
I also like clearly defined expectations.

<p>
It seems we understand each other.

together-together at this thing?

<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<p>
Oh, uh, well...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<p>
I mean, I know we're together.

I just meant publicly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<p>
Like, are we gonna introduce the world

to "BoJina"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
Well, yeah, I just... I'm not sure

the world is ready for, um, BoJina.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
-Oh, yeah, you're probably right.

-[phone chimes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
[sighs] What do you want,

Mr. Peanutbutter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<p>
Gotcha! It's not Steven Spielberg.

I changed my name in your contacts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<p>
-[BoJack groans]

-Pickles wants to say "hi."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<p>
-<i>What pickles?</i>

-Hi, BoJack!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
Uh, hello. Are you the pickles?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<p>
I don't know if I'm <i>the </i>Pickles,

but maybe one day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<p>
-Right now I'm just a waitress.

<i>-Oh, right. The waitress.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
Well, I don't know if I'm <i>the </i>waitress.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
She's being modest.

She's a waitress-<i>slash-</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
-<i>aspiring Instagram influencer.</i>

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<p>
<i>Is that Gina?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

<i>-Wow.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
BoJack Horseman and Mr. Peanutbutter,

and also Gina on the same phone call?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<p>
What is this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
I don't know what this is.

Why did you call me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<p>
[Peanutbutter] <i>Oh, yeah!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<p>
You wanna ride with me and Pickles

to the premiere?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
It'll be like this, but for 40 minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<p>
-Hard no.

-Hardly no?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
-That sounds like a yes.

-<i>Okay, bye.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
-[phone beeps]

-Well, anyway-- hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
Huh. He must have accidentally hung up,

right after he accidentally said,

"Okay, bye."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
As the clam said to the crab

at the undersea ball...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
"Shell we dance?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
There are some superficial similarities.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<p>
Superficial, shmuperficial!

It's the same line!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<p>
-Doesn't mean I stole it!

-Flip.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
I spent months on that line.

I slaved, finessed, crafted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
The world was a block of marble,

and, like Michelangelo,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
I chiseled it into my David,

as I did for each and every one

of Crazy AZ's <i>Frozen Funnies.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
Mr. Ziegler, we have so much respect

for your work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<p>
Do you think I'm like a penny

on a railroad track?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
Prone to flattery?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
We've got a premiere to get to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
How long do we have to listen to this guy

do his Popsicle schtick?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<p>
It's pronounced "stick," idiot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
Play nice, Flip.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
If this gets out, everyone will be talking

about the stolen gag,

instead of all the great parts of the show

that weren't stolen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<p>
Fine. What do you want?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
I want what every comedy writer wants.

<i>Respect!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
Oh! What if I just let you come

to the premiere party with us?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<p>
They have tiny tacos in soft shells

that are impossible to fold

without making a big mess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
I accept your terms. Where do I sign?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<p>
-Can we go now?

-Wait.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<p>
{\an8}"Abel Ziegler ampersand"?

What are you ampersanding?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
-My former writing partner, Ziggy Abler.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
I can only give permission

for the part I wrote.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<p>
I'm the set-up guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
If you want the punch line,

you gotta talk to Ziggy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
Can you ask him to sign the release?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<p>
I can't even ask him the best time

to go to the dentist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<p>
He hasn't talked to me for 30 years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<p>
-Now, you mentioned a party?

-[Flip groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<p>
[Pickles] Wow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<p>
A real Hollywoo premiere party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<p>
Can we get our pictures taken,

and drink specialty cocktails,

and form life-long bonds

with other fancy celebrities,

and read in magazines,

"Who wore it better?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
And then people vote,

and then 78 percent of readers say,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<p>
-"Pickles did!"

-[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<p>
Hey, BoJack, can we get some of just you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
-Oh, uh, yeah.

-Mm-hmm. I'll see you in there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
FYI, you're gonna want pictures of her

after you see what she does in <i>Philbert.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
Let me tell you something,

that 39-year-old actress is going places.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
-Oh. Hey.

-What happened to your arm?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
-Oh, just some asshole got T-boned by me.

-Oh, my God. When?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
Uh... couple weeks ago? Or months?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<p>
As Philbert says, "Time is like a woman;

completely impossible to comprehend."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
I think we ended up cutting that line

because the network was worried

it would be offensive

to people who didn't know

what time it was.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
-[clattering]

-This you call a tip?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
I haven't seen a tip this measly

since my bris.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
You must be Ziggy Abler.

Oh, thank you so much for coming.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<p>
Darling, you're wasting your time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
I love to sign documents.

In fact, that's my signature move.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
But if Abel signed it, I won't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<p>
I guess you could say I'm willing,

but not Abel!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
-Oh...!

-Now where are those tiny tacos?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
-[bell chimes]

-Cuckoo.

<p>
Oh, is it five o'clock already?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<p>
If you've poured me a drink,

you must want something.

</p>

<p>
-Out with it.

-[Henry] <i>I want to be on top of you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
There's no one on top of me.

I'm CEO of this company.

</p>

<p>
<i>-That's my favorite position.</i>

-Well, you can't have it. It's mine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<p>
<i>Give it to me.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<p>
You want to be tantamount

to this catamount?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
You've got balls, I'll give you that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
[clanking, whirring] <i>I am a horny robot.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<p>
For my job, yes, you've been quite clear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
But if you were CEO, what would I do?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<p>
Take a portraiture class

at the Learning Annex?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
While away the hours,

painting canvas after canvas of my wife,

and, through this act,

rediscover the woman I fell in love with

those many years ago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
No, such a realization would only crush

my too-feeble heart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<p>
After all, what benefit is it to love

without the words to express it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
What could I possibly say to articulate

my deep devotion to this woman,

who has become but a stranger to me now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<p>
[whirring] <i>I am powerless in the face</i>

<i>of your mesmerizing sexual energy.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<p>
[gasps] Such a brain for business,

yet such a tongue for poetry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
So, I am resigning from my post,

effective immediately.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<p>
I leave you in the good hands

of Henry Fondle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
-Henry, would you like to say a few words?

-Henry] <i>You will submit to my desires.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<p>
-Very impressive.

-He's leaning in and I respect that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
-Uh... guys, are you sure about this?

-I've never been more sure about anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<p>
Todd, why don't you show your new boss

around the premises?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
I'm actually about to head out

to the <i>Philbert</i> premiere party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<p>
-[Henry] <i>I'm coming.</i>

-Brilliant! You'll take him with you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<p>
Oh, no, no.

He doesn't need to come.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<p>
[Henry] <i>I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

<i>Oh, God, I'm coming.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
Whatever you say... boss.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<p>
[splattering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
Hello, everyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<p>
Thank you for attending the premiere

of my opus.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
I hope you all enjoy it

because that means you are smart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<p>
If you don't get it, that means

that my genius wasn't appreciated

in my own time, and that's okay, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
[weak laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
Why are you laughing?

Please do not laugh during the screening.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<p>
This episode contains

no intentional humor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
[chuckles] Okay. That's--

that's always a good sign,

when you have to clarify that.

Look, folks, Herb is being modest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
-"Herb"?

-I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
[laughs] Flip. Did I say Herb?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
Herb is being modest,

but he put together a tremendous show

that I think that you guys

are really gonna love.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<p>
That's right.

It all came out of this brain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<p>
-Ha! That brain, he says?

-That brain? Double-ha!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<p>
Shh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
And the most amazing thing about this show

is that I'm sure we all have Philberts

in our lives,

or we are Philberts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<p>
You know, we've all done terrible things

that we deeply regret.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<p>
I've done so many... unforgivable things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<p>
And I think that,

that's what this show says.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
Is that... is that we're all terrible,

so therefore we're all... okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<p>
And I think

that's a really powerful message.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<p>
Okay, well, without further ado,

the first chapter,

and notice I said "chapter" not episode

because I think of this show as more

of a novel than a TV show...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<p>
-of <i>Philbert!</i>

-[applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<p>
[BoJack's voice]

<i>Nothing's lonelier than a party.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<p>
[cheering, applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
Barf me a river!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<p>
[camera shutter clicks]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
[phone clicking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<p>
Hey, Pickles, where have you been?

You left after, like, ten minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
My friend Ilana, not my best friend Ilana,

but another Ilana who is my friend,

was having a crisis,

and I needed to text her "LOL."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<p>
Well, you missed the whole episode.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<p>
I saw the first ten minutes!

I just couldn't get into it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<p>
And you kept saying,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<p>
"Do you love it? Are you loving it?

How did you like that scene?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<p>
Well, did you love it? Were you loving it?

How did you like that scene?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<p>
Every time you showed up on screen,

I kept thinking,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
"That's not a dirty cop,

that's my boyfriend!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
The sweetest, cutest dog

in the whole world!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<p>
And then you'd shoot someone,

and I was like... eww!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<p>
-Fritz is the hardest I've ever acted.

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
Harder than the ice bucket challenge,

but it was fake ice.

I wanted you to see it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<p>
I'm going to fix this.

You stay here and party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
I'll go home.

I'll watch the entire season of your show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<p>
You don't have to do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
And you don't have to like every one

of my Instagram posts, but you do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<p>
The least I could do

is watch your TV show,

even if it kills me

because I hate it so much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
-Well, don't watch it if you hate it.

-I'm going to do this for us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<p>
-But--

-I love you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
-[sighs]

-[buzzing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
I've been to dozens of these things

and I've never heard applause like that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
We might actually get a season two.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<p>
-That's never happened to me before.

-That's incredible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<p>
Excuse me,

can I borrow you for a few minutes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
-Oh, sure. Gina, do you mind if I, um...?

-Yeah, go ahead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<p>
Oh, no, I was actually talking to Gina.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
Me? I'm being borrowed for a few minutes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<p>
Oh! Well, yeah. Yeah, of course.

Yeah, yeah. Sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<p>
Wow. Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<p>
Hey, how you doing? Hey, you came!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<p>
Flip, I screwed up.

I didn't know it would feel like that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<p>
To be in that room.

To hear people cheering <i>for Philbert!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<p>
-What are you talking about?

-When I first started on this job,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<p>
I wanted to make <i>Philbert</i>

more well-rounded,

so the audience

could relate to him better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<p>
And now you're upset

because I didn't mention you

in my introduction.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
Diane, the whole point of television

is it's a collaborative medium,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
-where one person gets all the credit.

-No, it's not about that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
I made him more vulnerable,

and that made him more likable,

which makes for a better TV show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
But if <i>Philbert</i> is just a way

to help dumb assholes<i> </i>rationalize

their own awful behavior,

well, I'm sorry,

but we can't put this out there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<p>
Uh, it's out there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<p>
The whole season's dropping at midnight

all over the world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
-I can't be here.

-[Flip sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<p>
Come on, fellas.

I know we can find a solution here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<p>
I doubt it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<p>
We have the same problem

as a hematology lab

that goes a week without electricity!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<p>
Too much bad blood!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<p>
But you obviously work together so well.

What went wrong?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />

<p>
It was a long time ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<p>
My wife Harriet

always had a sneaker for Ziggy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
Oh, and the unspoken resentment crept in?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

<p>
Unspoken? It was shouted!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
Nevertheless, me and Harriet ended up

having a fling.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<p>
Eventually, we got married.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<p>
-And that killed the partnership?

-No, we got over that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<p>
But at their tenth anniversary,

I had a few too many--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<p>
And what, you took a swing at him?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<p>
I said I always felt

he had the easier job,

coming up with the punch lines.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<p>
And then what? What led to the rift?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<p>
Led? That's the whole rift!

He besmirched my craft.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<p>
I still haven't forgiven

the son of a bitch!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<p>
I said it then, and I stand by it now!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<p>
All the pressure's on the punch line!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<p>
Pressure? Please!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<p>
Set-ups need context,

mise-en-scène, flavor!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
I carried us to the top

of the Popsicle stick game!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
You wrote the part

they let you try before you buy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<p>
I had to deliver the money line!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<p>
[both] Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
So, you both think you had the harder job?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
-[Abel] Of course!

-Indubitably!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
Well, what if you tried switching roles?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<p>
-You mean, I tag <i>his </i>set-ups?

-Why not?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<p>
I don't know.

I'm a punch line guy my whole life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
How do I come up with straight lines?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
-You could try using a ruler.

-Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<p>
[both laugh]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
-Oh, I missed you, Abel!

-You, too, Zig!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<p>
All right, so we have a deal?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<p>
What did the terminally ill man say

to Dr. Kevorkian?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
"Give me that sweet release!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<p>
Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<p>
Did you really mean what you said,

before the screening?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<p>
About how Philbert made you feel okay,

about yourself?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
Oh, I don't know--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<p>
Because, you know,

that's not the point of Philbert--

for guys to watch it and feel okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<p>
Diane, it's a compliment.

You did a good job. Relax.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<p>
I don't want you, or anyone else,

justifying their shitty behavior

because of the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
What is your problem?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:13" />

<p>
Why can't you accept

that something you did is successful?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<p>
It's connecting to people,

and that's good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<p>
You're right, sorry.

I don't know why I thought you would care.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<p>
-Excuse me?

-What is going on with you? You're a mess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<p>
-Am I?

-I feel like I barely know you anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<p>
Oh, bullshit. Don't give me that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
-It's true. I don't know you.

-No. You know me. You do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
Then what the hell happened in New Mexico?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
Look, I...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
I don't know what you think

that you know--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
I don't know anything!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<p>
I mean, I know something happened

with a girl in New Mexico,

and I know it resulted in

you coming home in a boat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
-Well, that's--

-I also know...

that your old friend Charlotte

lives in New Mexico

because you used to leave

her business card lying around the house,

and I know her daughter is a senior

at Oberlin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:52" />

<p>
-How--?

-And I know you went to Oberlin

during your bender three years ago

because a bunch of students

posted pictures of you on Facebook.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<p>
Jesus Christ,

why are you so obsessed with me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>
I am not obsessed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<p>
I wanted to know what happened,

and you wouldn't tell me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<p>
-You never asked!

-Okay, so I'm asking now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
What happened in New Mexico?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<p>
-Hallo! Smile for Yahoo, Finland!

-[camera shutter clicks]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<p>
What I don't understand is why you feel

like you deserve to know

every shitty thing I ever did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
I don't deserve anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
I would like to know

when you've done shitty things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>
Why is that your business?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
Because I'm your friend,

and I care about you,

and I wrote a book about you,

and now I wrote this show for you,

and I am very publicly your friend,

so if it gets out that you're doing

creepy stuff, that makes me look bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<p>
Oh! So you're worried about things

that I may have done

because you think

that it reflects badly on <i>you?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<p>
Hurts your brand?

That's your moral high ground?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<p>
This is not about "moral high ground."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<p>
Wanna know about New Mexico?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<p>
You want to know about the one

little thing that I did in New Mexico,

which, by the way,

wasn't even really a thing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
-You know what? Spare me.

-No, I'm gonna tell you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<p>
I'll tell you what you want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
And while I'm at it, you wanna hear about

what happened at the MTV beach house?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<p>
Or why I'm not allowed

to fly United anymore?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
Or what happened with Sharona,

the makeup lady on <i>Horsing Around?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
-What?

-Or the dozens of other shady things

that may or may not have occurred

in my life that I can barely even remember

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<p>
'cause I was high or drunk

or it was 30 years ago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<p>
And you don't feel bad,

about any of this stuff?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<p>
Yeah, of course I do!

I've spent so much time feeling bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<p>
By the way, most of these women...

don't even remember, I bet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
Well, that's really convenient for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
I'm the one

who has to live with this shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
I'm the one who has to feel the guilt

all day, every day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
So, you're the victim here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<p>
Yeah, and I know

that's not the woke, progressive,

intersectionally appropriate thing to say,

but I would say, yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
I'm the one who has suffered the most

because of the actions of BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<p>
<i>-You've </i>suffered?

-Yeah, I have!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<p>
<i>-The most?</i>

<i>-The most!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
Really? More than, say, Sarah Lynn?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
Don't talk to me about her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
No, I wanna know how <i>you're </i>the victim

of the Sarah Lynn story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<p>
-I'm serious.

-Explain to me...

how Sarah Lynn's overdose was

really rough for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<p>
-Shut up.

-You feel a lot of guilt about that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<p>
You feel a lot of guilt because you were

the only father figure she ever had,

and when she came to you for help, you--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
-Hey, how you doing?

-You folks having a good time?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<p>
You look great. Thanks for coming.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
-You had sex with her?

-That's-- ! No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
And then when she was sober,

you took her on a month-long bender?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<p>
And then she died. And she is dead now.

And you're still alive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<p>
With a girlfriend, who is also alive,

and a TV show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
And that's been really hard for <i>you,</i>

the main character in this story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
Why are you bringing this shit up?

Is this fun for you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
-To really rub in--

-It's not <i>fun.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<p>
You win! You scored all the points

in the argument!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<p>
According to facts, you are right

and I am wrong, like always.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
But you know what? I don't care.

Because I'm trying to move forward.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
You haven't changed at all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
Yes! Congratulations!

You are the last person to get that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
I'm not gonna <i>change.</i>

I don't need your <i>help</i> for <i>changing,</i>

so you can stop trying

to make me your project.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
-That's not--

-When I met you, I was depressed

because I didn't like myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<p>
And when you wrote that book

and sold a bajillion copies,

you taught me that as screwed up

as I am, that's okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<p>
<i>You </i>did that. And now I'm okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<p>
I don't believe that's true.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
And I don't think you believe it's true.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
I think you want me to tell you

that you can be better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<p>
And even though you're being

a total asshole right now,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<p>
I still believe it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<p>
If all you've gotten

out of this friendship,

is the idea that you should be okay

with yourself, as you are,

then I don't think

this is a good relationship...

for either of us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
-Diane, come on.

-I'm going home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
No, Diane, we're saying things,

but let's just go back to the party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<p>
I'm done... with all of this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<p>
I went to New Mexico to see Charlotte.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
She was married with a daughter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
But it wasn't like...

what you're thinking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
She was 17, which is the legal age

of consent in New Mexico,

and she wasn't drunk, so,

not that I wanted to, I never... I didn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<p>
That's the dumbest part of all of this!

I didn't do anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
I mean, the fact that this has turned

into such a thing for you--

you know, maybe I didn't tell you

because there was nothing to tell.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<p>
Did you ever think of that?

She was my friend's daughter,

and she wanted it, and I was... [breathes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
I was in a bad place

because Charlotte had just--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<p>
So, then she came onto my boat,

Charlotte, I mean,

and she walked in,

and I was with her daughter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
But again, nothing had happened yet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
-"Yet?"

-Nothing happened.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
Goodbye, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<p>
-Diane, no!

-Hey-- Aah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
You wanted me to tell you. I told you.

You know everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<p>
-Please let go of me.

-Diane, please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
You're hurting me,

and I would like you to let go now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<p>
[winces, sighs]

</p>

[whirring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
-So, what'd you think of the show, boss?

-[Henry] <i>More, more.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<p>
Well, all ten episodes

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
-will be on our website at midnight.

<i>-More.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
-You want more episodes?

<i>-Give it to me.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<p>
Ooh! Flip! They're picking us up

for more episodes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<p>
Wow. And my mother said

I'd never last as long as <i>Hung.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<p>
Well, who's <i>Hung </i>now, Mom?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<p>
Uh, right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<p>
[puffs] Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<p>
[grunts] Ow! Oh, ah!

</p>

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
-Oh. Hey!

-Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
-You're leaving?

-Yeah. You?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
I'm just getting some air.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
No, wrong Prius.

I'm sorry I lost my ticket!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<p>
-[sighs]

-[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
Want me to drive you home?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
You can come back

and get your car tomorrow?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
You don't have to do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<p>
Of course not.

I don't have to do anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
-[camera shutters clicking]

-[guests laughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />

<p>
Gina, I know it's early,

but have you started writing

your acceptance speech for the Emmys?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
Oh, stop. I'll probably just repurpose

whatever I say at the SAG Awards.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
-[laughter]

-Is that gonna read as cocky?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<p>
Can you explain to your readers

that I'm being charmingly self-effacing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
-Excuse me.

-Oh, hey, hot stuff! Whoa!

</p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<p>
Thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<p>
And, great job, by the way.

You're really good on the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<p>
Yeah? No. Me? No. Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<p>
Yeah! You're a good actor.

I never knew that about you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<p>
Well, I'll see you back on set, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
Did you hear we got picked up

for more episodes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:20" />

<p>
I'm not going back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<p>
Oh. Well, then,

I guess I'll see you around.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<p>
I hope so. [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:27" />

<p>
I can't believe I finally got you

to leave a party early.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:30" />

<p>
Come on, you know I'd do anything for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:33" />

<p>
-Why? I'm such a disaster.

-You're not a disaster.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:38" />

<p>
You're Diane. You're amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:45" />

<p>
Do you wanna come in?
