What happened to my birthday cake?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<p>
- Goober.

- It wasn't me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<p>
But you're welcome to check my pockets.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<p>
- Go home, Goober.

- Go home, Goober.

[man] <i>Oh, I was a Goober, all right.</i>

<i>I Goobed with the best of 'em.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
But that ain't me anymore.

<p>
I'm now the proprietor/spokesperson/

number one customer of Whale World.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
At Whale World, families come together

to admire the fine female form

of the majestic killer whale.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
It's educational.

</p>

<p>

<i>dorsal fins in town</i>

Bring your prepubescent daughters,

who are beginning to be cognizant

of a woman's role in the world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
They won't internalize

deeply problematic notions

about the commodification

of sexuality in today's society.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<p>
What are you talking about?

It's just whales.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
And what about so-called "experts,"

who say it's wrong

to keep these girls in captivity

so they can amuse and entertain us?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
Well, to those people I say,

"Stop saying that, okay?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<p>
{\an8}These sea girls are my family,

and my business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<p>
{\an8}And they can be yours too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<p>
{\an8}Come on down to Whale World,

a fun, sexy time for the whole family.

- Where are you? I hear mirth.

<p>
{\an8}An elementary school all inclusive

non-denominational winter day pageant.

<p>
{\an8}Oh, no. The snow goblin wants to destroy

our seasonal festivities.

<p>

Jesus, Jill.

And you thought your play sucked.

<p>
Hobnob. Did you check

on Cuddlywhiskers like I asked?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:03" />

<p>
He's doing great.

Little of this, little of that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<p>
Likes to go jogging... in a big wheel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<p>
- You didn't check on him, did you?

- Completely forgot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<p>
{\an8}- Shh! Keep it down, buddy.

- Oh, I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<p>
{\an8}Did you miss the three wise people make

their journey to visit the regular baby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
Go to his house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<p>
If he's not there, you must retrieve

something for me,

something of a sensitive nature.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<p>
{\an8}Oh, fine, if it'll finally make you stop

calling me, asking me to go on errands.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<p>
- What do you need?

- A letter I wrote him,

back when we were, prepare yourself,

I'm about to say lovers... Lovers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
{\an8}- That was not enough time to prepare.

- Get off the phone, jerk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
It was years ago

and it was quite beautiful

and disgusting all at once.

I remember it fondly. And horribly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
- What's in the letter?

- None of your concern. I must have it,

for... sentimental reasons. Goodbye.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<p>
{\an8}- Did you have a nice phone call?

- Are you in the Academy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
{\an8}- No.

- Then I don't care what you think.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
{\an8}- I got to go do a thing for someone.

- Fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
{\an8}You made your appearance,

you were magnificent, I'm very proud.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
{\an8}But don't forget, you have a full day

of muckety-muck glad-handing.

</p>

<p>
{\an8}You'll be wonderful,

I have complete faith in you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
{\an8}That is literally the first time

anyone ever said that to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
{\an8}Diane, you'll keep up

his Internet presence?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
{\an8}I want him trending by this afternoon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<p>
{\an8}But good trending, not bad trending,

you understand?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<p>
{\an8}Hashtag you betcha.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<p>
{\an8}Did I just say hashtag out loud?

Hashtag, oops. Hashtag, oh no!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<p>
I'm honestly more alarmed

by the "you betcha".

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<p>
I'll take a smoke break

before these little boogers

dig into the refrain

of "Frosty the Non-Gendered Snow Person."

Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
Hello, my precious darling

slice of sunshine,

who I am <i>not </i>putting on a pedestal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<p>
Just calling for our daily download,

as per Dr. Janet's

friendly but firm suggestion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<p>
When do you think you'll be home?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
- Uh, it might be late.

- Okay, just let me know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<p>
I cherish you, I respect you

and you have value.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
I feel valued and I value you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
I am hearing that and I accept that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<p>
- Diane?

- Yes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<p>
<i>Do you accept my acceptance?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
I hear it and I accept it and I value it

and all the other verbs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<p>
Promise you won't work too hard today?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
I won't, if you promise me

you won't bother that skunk next door.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<p>
I don't want to come home

to a stinky husband.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<p>
That is some great food for thought.

I gotta go right now.

Mr. Peanutbutter,

my favorite weekday client.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<p>
- Why are you calling on the weekend?

- I need your help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<p>
I've done something bad, very bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<p>
Put the corpse on ice, I'm on my way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<p>
What? No, it's not. Why would I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
Listen, I was sniffing around

where I didn't belong and I got skunked.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
- What?

<i>- You got to help us.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
- Us?

- Todd's here too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
I'm skunked, Princess Carolyn.

Skunked real bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
Yeah, yeah, we got real bad skunked,

super skunked.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
- Hardcore.

- Yeah, hardcore skunked.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
Okay. First things first,

don't go back in the house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
Sadly, you can call me L.L. Cool J

because I am in the house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
Yecch! Okay, don't move.

I'll be there in 20.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
Mind if I do this real quick?

I gotta pick up a letter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<p>
Can we make the appearances

we're supposed to make and go home?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<p>
Oh, sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
I haven't seen you much

since you moved out of my deck chairs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
You know, I've been focusing

on my new job and my marriage and--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
- And avoiding me?

- I'm not avoiding you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
I'm just making an effort

to not be in a room alone with you

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<p>
- because I am... avoiding you.

- Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
You know, I think we're alike

in a lot of ways.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<p>
I always tell people

you're like the not-cool version of me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<p>
Sometimes that's great,

but it also means we can bring out

the worst in each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
I'm trying to get my life back on track.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
I just think maybe it's better,

for both of us,

if we keep things

a little more professional.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
Yes, okay. Professional.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
BoJack and Diane being professional.

Doing our jobs and nothing else.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
We're at the place I needed to go to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
It's so weird I drove here on accident.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
Might as well run in

and grab that thing I need to get.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<p>
- Then, back to business.

- [groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
[creaking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
- It's spooky in here. Too spooky.

- Really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<p>
And what would be the right amount

of spooky? Jesus, this thing's heavy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
Now I know how Hilary Swank's arms

got so jacked.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
Put it down, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<p>
Does it look weird?

Me with an Oscar?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<p>
- I actually think that it feels--

- Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<p>
- I think she's dead.

- Hold on, maybe she's not dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
Maybe she's just being a-- a whale?

No, she's dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
Maybe there's someone

in her phone we can call.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
Diane, kids these days don't call.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<p>
They communicate

via a combination of text messages,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
- eye rolls, and dick pics.

- Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:49" />

<p>
What is it? Dick pics?

See if they spell out a message.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
- [guns cocking]

- Freeze! Drop the Oscar!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
- Oh, man.

- Well, well, well.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
Or should I say whale, whale, whale?

Killer whale, that is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<p>
Or should I say <i>killed</i> whale?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<p>
- Listen, Officer--

- I told you to freeze.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<p>
You just became prime suspects

in the case I like to call,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
"Black and White and Dead All Over,

</p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
Eh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
- Cuff 'em, boys, or, uh, girls.

- I am a woman, sir.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
Lindsay, you know I am trying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<p>
Can we please show a united front

in front of the perps?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<p>
- We will talk about this later.

- Aww.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
Ohh! It smells like a skunk

skunked another skunk in here,

then they smoked a joint.

What happened?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
First I rolled all over the couch

to get the skunk stench out,

but that did not work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<p>
Then I ran into every room to rub myself

on all my clothes and belongings,

to get the Mr. Peanutbutter smell back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
And then I smoked a joint,

so that might be

why it smells like skunk in here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn, I have to fix this

before Diane gets home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<p>
Things have been shaky with us

since she pretended

to be out of the country for two months.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<p>
And then when I filled our entire house

with these giant crates

of spaghetti strainers, that did not help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<p>
Why buy these spaghetti strainers

in the first place?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
Oh, I don't even remember.

I'm sure it'll pay off at some point.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
Man, married life is weird.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
We're making an effort

and getting stronger every day,

but I swear to God we are like five

big fights away from a divorce,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
I do not want this to be one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<p>
Okay, number first.

We got to get you in a tomato bath.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
Mmm! Delicious and nutritious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Is marinara all right,

or will I need something zestier

like Arrabiata?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
Tomato bath.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<p>
Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<p>
I am so high right now. [sniffs]

Wait, was there a skunk in here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
[Princess Carolyn groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<p>
- What do you know about Nadia?

- Uh, who's Nadia?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
Your friend doing the face-down mambo

in the king-sized bathtub.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<p>
- Now I know her name is Nadia.

- Oh, so you're a comedian, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<p>
Although I am trying to branch

into more serious roles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<p>
You pigs think you can march all over us.

But I know my rights.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<p>
- Yeah, what are they?

- I mean, I don't <i>know them</i> know them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<p>
But I know that I have them.

So, can I check my phone real quick?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
You're not gonna look up your rights,

are you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
What? No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<p>
I'm just supposed to moderate

an Emily VanCamp live-chat talkback

on Snapchat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
Let me just set up

the user preferences here, and...

you can't detain us

unless we're under arrest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<p>
Damn it. You <i>were </i>looking up

your rights, weren't you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<p>
Nope, that was just a thing

I already knew.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<p>
Everyone's stupid rights these days.

I never get to have any fun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<p>
- Let's get out of here.

- BoJack, I need to show you something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
This is Nadia's phone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
I did not know you were such a klepto.

I can buy you a new phone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<p>
Check this out,

the last text message she sent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
"BoJack is going to kill me?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
I think someone's trying to frame you,

for murder.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
Oh, my God, we're gonna be late

for the Bat Mitzvah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:48" />

<p>
We got to get to Brentwood.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
At this time of day?

It's gonna be... murder.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey. L'chaim ♪</i>

</p>

<p>
<i>♪ Hey, hey, hey. L'chaim ♪</i>

Hey!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<p>
I can't believe

you're not more concerned about this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
- Someone is implicating you in a murder.

- I can be two things at once.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<p>
I am very concerned,

but also very proud

that today Tovah is a woman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
Hi, BoJack Horseman,

potential Oscar nominee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
I am kvelling over here. Real verklempt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<p>
<i>Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<p>
<i>- Shabbat shalom.</i>

<i>- Shabbat shalom</i> to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
We need to figure out who's behind this.

Call Jill, find out what she knows.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<p>
Good thinking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<p>
If I go to jail, that will throw

a monkey wrench into my awards campaign.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<p>
The Academy does not look kindly

on murder.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<p>
Rape, they don't seem

to have a problem with.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<p>
Be careful. Jill could be the one

trying to set you up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
She did send us to the house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<p>
Backstrom, turn it down a notch.

Aren't you supposed to be tweeting for me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
This is a crucial weekend

for BoJack brand awareness.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<p>
What am I supposed to tweet?

"Someone got murdered, we found the body.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<p>
- Hashtag murder party"?

- No, obviously.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
[grunts] Bat Mitzvah in Brentwood.

Hashtag Jewish stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
- [Jill] <i>BoJack.</i>

- Hey, Jill.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<p>
You're not trying to frame me

for murder, are you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
<i>- What?</i>

- Can you take this seriously?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<p>
Can you take <i>this </i>seriously?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
You find the letter? Check in the vent

behind the water feeder.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<p>
I've been pretty tied up

at Drake's cousin's Bat Mitzvah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
Did you know Drake's cousin was Jewish?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
I'm sorry, did I forget to hang up?

Get the letter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<p>
This is why I couldn't live in New York.

Everyone's so bossy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
Also, what's with the pizza

by the slice thing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
Hey, New York,

either eat a pizza or don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
I'm calling the last person

Nadia was in contact with before she died.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
Maybe she knows something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<p>
- [female]<i> Nadia?</i>

- No, this is--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<p>
<i>Where you been? Boys upstairs</i>

<i>are getting real sick of you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<p>
[Goober] <i>Get off the phone,</i>

<i>Skinny Gina. You're on the clock.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
[female] <i>I gotta go.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<p>
- That man's voice sounded familiar.

- Yeah, super familiar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
Something about that voice

made me want to tell it to go home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
- [gasps] It's Goober.

- [gasps] Goober.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
That guy never went home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
Except for that one episode

"Goober Goes Home,"

because we were

on a softball team together

and the home was home plate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
They must be at Whale World.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<p>
Okay, good. Because I absolutely

want to get to the bottom of this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<p>
Can we at least wait

until after they lift the chair?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<p>
- That is my favorite part.

- Yeah, we gotta lift the chair.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
[Todd]

Oh, I taste delicious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
How you boys doing in there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<p>
- Ahh! I feel clean as a whistle.

- Oh, no, the stain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<p>
- Me three.

- [groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<p>
You took your bath together?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
Lena Dunham takes baths with her friends

and no one gives her shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<p>
Gotta-- Gotta get dry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter, use the towel.

Do not shake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<p>
- The sauce is so sticky and wet.

- Don't shake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
It's dripping all over my body.

I gotta shake!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<p>
- Aaah!

- [Princess Carolyn] Aah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<p>
Oh, yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
[shuddering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<p>
Oh, look, that made things worse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
Okay, I'll call a cleaning service.

You two get rid of the stinky clothes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<p>
You got it, chief.

Hooray! Following instructions.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
[dance music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
Fish half off at Beverly Hills

farmers market.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<p>
Hashtag something fishy this way comes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
You're not putting emojis in, are you?

BoJack don't tweet emojis.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<p>
- BoJack? Oh, my God!

- Oh, hey... you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<p>
I haven't seen you in forever.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
- You came to see your old friend.

- Uh, yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<p>
All this time

I thought you forgot about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
Things haven't been so swell with me

since the show ended.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
- Not like you, Mr. Movie Star.

- [chuckles] Okay, buddy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
Just knowing that you care about me

and would come patronize

my place of business,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<p>
- it really means a lot.

- You got it, Goober.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
Oh, no, I haven't been Goober

for 20 years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<p>
- You can call me by my real name.

- Okay, maybe I will.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
Right now, call me by my real name.

I want to hear you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<p>
I want to say Goo... bert.

Goobert?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<p>
Oh, you didn't come to see me, did you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<p>
- No, we did, but--

- I get it. I'm a big joke.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<p>
"Let's all go down to Whale World

and laugh at Goober.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<p>
We'll have a whale of a good time

at Goober's expense.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:38" />

<p>
He's always good for a laugh."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<p>
I should've known better

than to get my hopes up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<p>
Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<p>
We're looking for one of your strippers,

Skinny Gina?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

We don't employ strippers here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<p>
Whale World is a family establishment,

where children of all ages

have a fun, sexy time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<p>
Hey, Skinny Gina,

get that sweet tail over here!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
You got a customer. You enjoy yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
- Well, hello, land mammals.

- [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<p>
We're just here to ask you some questions

about your friend Nadia.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<p>
I'm on the clock. You want to chat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<p>
Buy me a private dance

in the Blowhole Room.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<p>
- Oh, please.

- Ugh, gross. Private dance?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<p>
But if that's the only way she'll talk,

then fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<p>
Fine, I'm offended. Yuck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<p>
But really, guys, gross. Start it now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<p>
- But gross.

- [groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<p>
Oh, um, you can dance however

you want. Don't do this for my benefit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<p>
Tango, waltz, salsa.

I'm just saying, but pretend I'm not here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
- How would you dance then?

- Like a stripper, probably.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
Listen, we have some bad news.

Your friend Nadia is dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<p>
- Not surprised.

- You're not?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<p>
A lot of girls like her come through here.

Sweet, vulnerable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<p>
This place takes 'em

and makes 'em a lot of promises.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<p>
They say they're gonna take care of you,

make you big like Shamu.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<p>
But once your body gets too banged up,

they don't want you no more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<p>
- Thar she blows, then thar she goes.

- Shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<p>
Watch your mouth, lady.

There are children here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<p>
- Uh...

- [giggling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
What do you know about Nadia's

relationship with Cuddlywhiskers?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<p>
Doesn't ring a bell, never met the guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<p>
His house has been abandoned

for months, though. That's all I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
- That's it?

- That's it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
A bunch of girls used to hang out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<p>
He had some sort of system.

Told 'em he was gonna help 'em.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
- What do you mean, "system"?

- I have already said too much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
A system is a formulated method

or plan of procedure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<p>
- I know what the word "system" means--

- But that's all I can say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<p>
That text that Nadia sent you,

"BoJack is going to kill me."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
Any idea what that's about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
Hey, I don't know nothing about BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<p>
How do you not know about BoJack?

I am very famous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<p>
- Time's up.

- [groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<p>
Hey, if you really want to know

about all that stuff,

come by here real late.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
There's an after-hours party.

But that's all I can say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
I'm not gonna spill any more beans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<p>
Say you got BoJack with you.

That'll get you in. Okay, that's it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
Is Wilbur coming today?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
Wilbur's not real. He was a character

on a TV show you were on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
- Oh. Are my kids coming today?

- Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<p>
- No.

- Hey there, fella.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<p>
Can't wait for you to see <i>Secretariat,</i>

think you're gonna love it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<p>
Hey, old pal.

Hope you remember how to vote.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:11" />

<p>
We have to go

to this Whale World party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:13" />

<p>
I know I should go,

I'm invested in figuring out

who's trying to frame me for murder.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:17" />

<p>
Are you sure you wanna go with me?

Outside of work hours?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<p>
I wouldn't want to be unprofessional.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
Sorry about what I said.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<p>
I was embarrassed by the person I was

when I was staying with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<p>
I'm trying not to be that person.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
I make you unhappy?

Is that what you're saying?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<p>
It's not about being happy.

That's the thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
I'm just trying to get through each day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
I can't keep asking myself, "Am I happy?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
It just makes me more miserable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<p>
Can I get a photo with the star?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
- Of course.

- Oh, thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<p>
I don't know if I believe in it,

real lasting happiness.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<p>
All those perky, well-adjusted people

you see in movies and TV shows?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
- I don't think they exist.

- No one's happy all the time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
- You have to focus on the small things.

- Right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<p>
- Like winning an Oscar.

- Right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>
Hey, old pal.

Look at this guy, still alive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<p>
Hope your voting finger works.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
- What happened out here?

- You told us to get rid of the clothes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<p>
Oh, we got rid of 'em, all right.

They're never coming back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
[cackling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:16" />

<p>
You two are impossible.

Why did you even call me here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
Because you're Princess Carolyn,

you can fix anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<p>
That's true.

But you can't start a fire on your lawn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<p>
There's a drought and--

There's a drought.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<p>
You, thoughtful husband that you are,

got rid of your lawn,

and replaced it

with drought-resistant landscaping.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<p>
This could work.

I got to make a few phone calls.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<p>
Aw, thanks. You're the best.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
I tell you, I've got half a mind

to go over

and give it to that skunk

for starting this whole darn thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<p>
No. You go inside to your spot

and stay there while I fix this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<p>
- Yeah, but-- Right, but, um...

- Stay. Stay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<p>
- Stay.

- [whimpers]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<p>
- [dance music playing]

- Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
- I, uh...

- Living the nightlife.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<p>
Hashtag feeling good about myself

and my choices.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<p>
Aah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<p>
Hey, look.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<p>
Let's definitely follow that guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
- Ladies first.

- What a gentleman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
Ohh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<p>
- Whoa.

- Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<p>
Ohh. Oh, my God.

BoJack kills?

<p>
Something tells me that's not a reference

to your old stand-up act.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
Was that necessary?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
- What do you want?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

Yeah? Let me see.

<p>
- From the logo.

- Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
[gasps] BoJack, you didn't kill Nadia.

BoJack did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
- What?

- [Diane grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<p>
Nighty-night.

</p>

<p>
Wakey, wakey.

</p>

<p>
- [groaning]

- So, you got a little curious, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
Thought you'd go sticking your little nose

where it doesn't belong?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<p>
What's the play here?

Trying to get a cut of my smack biz?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<p>
What? No, Goober.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
- You know my real name.

- I actually seriously don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
We just wanted to know why everyone

was talking about how BoJack kills?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
Why would you implicate me

in your drug business?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
Wait, I get what happened.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
You resented me all these years.

My fame, your obscurity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<p>
You made me the face of this drug,

because to you my face is a symbol

for the opiate of show business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<p>
- No, man. You played The Horse.

- Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
- Horse is a nickname for heroin.

- What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
- BoJack. Horse. Heroin.

- Uh-huh. Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<p>
Oh-- Oh, okay. Yeah, right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<p>
- Police!

- Oh, God, not again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<p>
Gotcha!

Richie Osborne, you're under arrest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
- Oh, right, Reggie.

- Richie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
- That's what I said. I said Rickie.

- [groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
Thank God. How did you find us?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
Your Twitter account is hooked up

to your phone's location services.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
We've been tracking you

through your tweets all night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
Actually, I've been tracking you

all night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<p>
Lindsay, I said "we".

Do you need credit for everything?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
- I would like credit for something.

- [sarcastic yowl]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<p>
What do we know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
Nadia was not murdered.

She died of a heroin overdose.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
No one tried to frame me.

All right, back in the Oscar race.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<p>
Look out, Jurj Clooners.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
But something's still fishy

about this whole mess,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<p>
- and it's not just the killer whales.

- Whales are mammals, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<p>
- I said it's <i>not</i> the whales.

- You said it's not <i>just</i> the whales.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
There's more to this story.

What are we missing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<p>
Cuddlywhiskers. What was Nadia

doing in his backyard in the first place?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<p>
What was this "system"?

And where is he now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<p>
Why was it so important to Jill

to get that letter back?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
Oh, yeah, the letter.

This mystery has too many things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<p>
I say we go back to the house and

finally get to the bottom of what's what.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
Oh, this is turning into a real caper.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<p>
A real Jill Pill jail fail

killer whale caper.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<p>
[BoJack] You're doing 50 in a 35.

[Diane] Oh, God, you're right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
I feel so alive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<p>
[groans] This letter is really graphic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
It's all about their magical nights

up at the Ojai property.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
Ojai property?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<p>
She wrote out the sounds.

What is a "sploink"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
Did you know Cuddlywhiskers

had an Ojai property?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
Sure. He always loved

to disappear up there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<p>
After our show got canceled,

he went there for six months.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
It's funny, at the time no one knew

where he was and we got really worried.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<p>
Anyway, wonder where he went this time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
Oh, you know what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
- I don't see him. Do you?

- Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<p>
- <i>I'm Terry Gross and this your ring tone.</i>

- Shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
- Diane, where the hell are you?

- Ojai.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
Oh, hi? You've been gone all night,

all you have to say is "Oh, hi?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<p>
I'm so sorry. BoJack and I

were trying to find a killer and--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<p>
Oh, you're with BoJack still?

Well, that explains it. Of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

I understand and affirm your feeling--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
I'm glad you're safe.

I was worried about you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
- What I'm hearing you say is you were--

- No, stop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<p>
You have to call me.

It doesn't matter what's happening,

doesn't matter

if it's the middle of the night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<p>
You can't keep doing this to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<p>
I'm sorry. I'm coming home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<p>
I'm going back to bed.

We'll talk about this in the morning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<p>
- Everything okay?

- No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
- Sorry.

- It's not your fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<p>
It's my fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<p>
- [gasps]

- BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
Mmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
After <i>The BoJack Horseman Show</i>

fell apart, I got depressed a long time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
Sure, I wrote a bunch of hit movies,

I made a ton of money,

but it wasn't fulfilling.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<p>
I remember when I won my Oscar,

standing up on that stage,

looking at the statue and thought,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<p>
"This is supposed to be

the happiest moment of my life."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<p>
And I never felt more miserable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
- Oh. Because you're sober?

- Because an Oscar is meaningless.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<p>
It's all meaningless.

I dedicated myself to helping others.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
I turned my home into a halfway house

for troubled addicts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />

<p>
I had this system for recovery,

and it helped a lot of them,

but even more slipped through the cracks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
That, too, left me empty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<p>
Everyone was worried about you,

you know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<p>
You can't just disappear.

You really hurt a lot of people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<p>
Sometimes you need to take responsibility

for your own happiness.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<p>
You don't think that's a little selfish?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<p>
I don't know what to tell you.

I'm happy, for the first time in my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<p>
I'm not gonna feel bad about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<p>
It takes a long time to realize

how truly miserable you are,

even longer to see

it doesn't have to be that way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<p>
Only after you give up everything

can you begin to find a way to be happy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:35" />

<p>
Can you believe that guy?

What a nut, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:39" />

<p>
I just wanna go home.
