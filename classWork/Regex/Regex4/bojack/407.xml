[dials rapidly]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<p>
[line ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
Whew.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<p>
-BoJack?

-I'm back in L.A.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<p>
-I should have called you--

-Yeah. You should have.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<p>
-I said I was sorry.

-No, you didn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
-Okay. Good to hear from you, BoJack.

-No--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
[sighs] Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
What the...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<p>
Okay, thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
What's going on here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<p>
Fundraising dinner for the Peanutbutter

for California campaign.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
-All right, I'm just gonna--

-Sorry. It's a fundraiser.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
-Uh...

-BoJack!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
I love your ironic take

on black-tie attire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<p>
It really says,

"I truly don't care what you think of me."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
This light bulb won't let me in

to your house without paying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
Ah, sorry about that.

Gotta raise those funds.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<p>
-Can't I just--

-Thanks for your support, buddy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
-Means so much. Erica!

-Hey--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
Look at you,

with the right number of ears!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
-Look, I just--

-Twenty thousand dollars a plate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
[growls]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
-Hmm...!

-[pops]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<p>
Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<p>
Hey, do you have another bathroom?

They're all occupied, and I gotta pee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<p>
Not because I'm pregnant or anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<p>
Because if I were pregnant, it would be

bad luck to tell you this early.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<p>
Presuming it was early.

But I'm not pregnant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<p>
This is just a normal,

non-pregnant gal type of having to pee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:26" />

<p>
-There's a bathroom in the pool house.

-You're a lifesaver.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<p>
Pardon me! Out of my way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<p>
Uh-oh. Am I in Ithaca?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<p>
Because you are looking

"gorges" this evening.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<p>
Well, I must be in Nazi Germany,

because you're "not so" bad yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<p>
-I'm sorry, yours was better.

-[BoJack] Hi.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<p>
Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:43" />

<p>
[munches]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<p>
Well, I should go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<p>
Looks like the work wife/ex-wife

is talking to my other ex-wife.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

<p>
-You have two ex-wives here?

-Katrina's his campaign manager.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<p>
[Peanutbutter] And Jessica Biel loves

getting photographed at fancy fundraisers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:55" />

<p>
If it isn't my two favorite ladies,

in the same room! This is great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<p>
-Hey.

-BoJack, I'm busy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<p>
You haven't seen me for a year and a half.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:03" />

<p>
Yeah, because you disapp--

No, I am not doing this now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:05" />

<p>
-Why don't you get yourself a drink?

-I will get a drink.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:08" />

<p>
I will get $20,000 worth of drinks.

[crunches]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:12" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<p>
Oh, Norman, we have to support the--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:15" />

<p>
-Ooh, yes.

-All right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<p>
[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:17" />

<p>
Hi, Zach Braff. Zach Braff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:19" />

<p>
Hey there. Famous actor Zach Braff,

how you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:21" />

<p>
-[glass clinks]

-Everyone? Thank you all for being here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:24" />

<p>
We're gonna beat that scoundrel

Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:28" />

<p>
Boo!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:29" />

<p>
...and bring likability back to politics.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:32" />

<p>
[cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<p>
I especially want to thank my pro-fracking

pals for being here tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<p>
You know, my wife said, "Don't frack,"

but we did it anyway,

and it all worked out.

Love you, sweetie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<p>
Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:44" />

<p>
Finally-- oh!

Sorry about that, folks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<p>
I sensed an earthquake.

Must have been a false--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:48" />

<p>
Oh, hey now!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<p>
Nope, I was definitely wrong.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:51" />

<p>
Listen to me,

I'm the dog who cried earthquake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<p>
[laughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<p>
-[bangs]

-[voices overlapping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<p>
-We're gonna die!

-Oh, fudge!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<p>
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

-I can't die!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<p>
I'm not famous enough yet to make

the "In Memoriam" montage at the Oscars!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<p>
I have so many regrets!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<p>
I just picked up a family sitcom

where the mom is a zombie!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<p>
[moans]

It's called<i> Mombie, </i>and it's terrible!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:14" />

<p>
I have a condition where every time

I sense a shift in power dynamics,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<p>
I have a tiny orgasm!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
I have no original ideas,

I just repeat things I hear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
-I've never been in love!

-I've never been in love!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<p>
I tried gay at theater camp!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<p>
I regret <i>everything!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<p>
-[Peanutbutter] Whoa!

-[BoJack laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
-[crashes]

-[all gasp]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
{\an8}[theme music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
[voices overlapping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<p>
Is anyone getting any bars?

I'm not getting any baa-rs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<p>
{\an8}Can someone validate my valet ticket?

I would like to go home now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<p>
{\an8}There's no way out.

Okay. Everybody stay sane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<p>
{\an8}I propose we set each other on fire

for warmth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<p>
{\an8}Who wants to be set on fire first?

Not me, I'm Jessica Biel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
{\an8}[woman] Yeah, that's right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
{\an8}The natives are getting restless,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<p>
{\an8}so why don't you say something

to comfort them?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
Okay. Everyone, remain calm!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
No one's going to light anyone on fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
For one thing,

that'd eat up a lot of oxygen

and who knows

how much we have down here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<p>
-[man] I want oxygen!

-[man screams] Air! I need air!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
[guests screaming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
{\an8}-You okay, sweetie?

-I think so.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<p>
{\an8}-That was really scary.

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<p>
{\an8}At least we know no one

is specifically at fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, except for San Andreas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<p>
{\an8}This was because you fracked

under our house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<p>
{\an8}I told you fracking was dangerous,

and you didn't listen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<p>
{\an8}And now our house is ruined

and we're trapped underground,

and we're all going to die!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<p>
{\an8}-Is this one of our sexy fights?

-[yells] No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<p>
Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<p>
{\an8}You can be mad at me or get drunk

with me, but you can't do both.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<p>
{\an8}Watch me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
Oh, what the shit?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
[creaks, crashes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<p>
-Oh, fish.

-[Todd] Uh... hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<p>
{\an8}-What are you doing in there?

-Uh, I live here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
Didn't you know

there was a huge party going on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<p>
I was going to go to the party

after my bath,

but then I realized

the bath <i>was </i>the party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<p>
Oh, God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, I'm not waiting around

to be rescued like some chump.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
Come on, let's go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<p>
{\an8}[Todd] Whoa...!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
-We gotta go in there?

-Well, I don't see any other way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<p>
Sometimes life is like the second season

of <i>Friday Night Lights</i>--

you gotta push through

and hope there's better stuff ahead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
Aw-ww!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
Guys, let's all try to just stay cool

and make the best of things, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
"Make the best of things"? You idiot,

we're trapped and we're terrified.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
Okay, settle down,

you future hard <i>Jeopardy</i> question.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<p>
Let's hear what the idiot has to say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
So that's a re-up on the idiot part?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<p>
How are we supposed to make

the best of things?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<p>
-We're stuck underground.

-This is true.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<p>
But most of us are important celebrities,

so someone will come for us soon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
And for you regulars,

I'm sure they'll bring you up with us!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<p>
What do we do till then?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
We're actors! I say we put on a show.

Who's with me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
A show? Who will be the star?

Me, I assume.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<p>
Sure you'll be the star,

and you'll be the star!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
And you'll be the star!

We'll all be the star!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<p>
Folks, I promise you

we will be out of here in no time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<p>
[cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
And that's when I realized...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
I just don't have the face for bangs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<p>
Oh, my God, thank you so much.

You're too kind! Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<p>
Thank you, Phoebe, for that rousing

<i>Tale from the Above Ground. </i>Who's next?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
I can't take this anymore.

I need to get out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
This is the longest I've gone

without moisturizing,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
-and I feel like a lizard!

-Humph.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<p>
-No offense.

-It's only been 72 hours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:49" />

<p>
I'm missing my general meeting at CBS.

I'm supposed to get baa-ck to work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
I can't live like this!

We've gotta light someone on fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
I'm starting to think that less-famous

Michelle Monaghan has the right idea

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<p>
-about lighting people on fire.

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<p>
Come on, party people, keep it together.

Let's not forget why we're here--

to raise money for my campaign,

and more recently, to not go crazy

and murder each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
Can someone please bring me my car?

It's a Prius. A silver Prius.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<p>
You're killing me, Zach.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<p>
[sighs]

Mr. Peanutbutter, you can do this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
Be the leader that I know you can be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<p>
Yeah. You're right. I've totally got this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
-[bangs]

-What in the world?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<p>
<i>"Vox clamantis in deserto."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<p>
-It is I.

-Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
-We're saved!

-Wow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
Oh, thank God. A leader.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
-[Diane laughs]

-[BoJack] Sh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
What's going on down here?

Anyone's looking for us?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
We're cool. Just being cool, don't worry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
Diane, have you just been getting drunk

with BoJack this whole time?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
-What? I'm still mad at you.

-[BoJack laughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
-Citizens, remain calm.

-Yeah, that's what I've been saying!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<p>
Rescue workers are coming

but it could be a while.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
State emergency funds have been depleted

due to budget overruns

on a costly bridge to Hawaii

that's being constructed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
Oh, yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
Since a woodchuck is a digging animal,

I came to get you out early.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<p>
Is that what a woodchuck is?

Why did I think it was like a beaver?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
What's it like out there, Woodchuck?

Whole neighborhood totaled?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<p>
-Is the city in chaos?

-No, it's really just your house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<p>
Because of all the fracking that's been

happening underneath your house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
Oh! Interesting!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
-Ay-yi-yi.

-Oh, right, right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<p>
So you just burrowed down here to rescue

your political opponent's top donors.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
That's convenient.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
It was actually very inconvenient,

but I put politics aside

to save you people from dying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<p>
Three cheers for Woodchuck!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
[all]

Hip, hip, hooray!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
Please, don't cheer too loudly.

The tunnel is very delicate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
-Hip, hip, hooray!

-Seriously, I think it's best to--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
-Hip, hip, hooray!

-[rumbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
-Let's cheer one more time, just for fun!

-No, please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<p>
-Four cheers. Why not? Hip, hip...

-Hooray!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<p>
-No!

-[rumbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<p>
[screams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
So turns out three cheers was probably

an adequate number of cheers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
[rumbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
-What was that?

-Just keep walking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
God, I can't wait to get home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<p>
I don't even have a home anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
Oh, man, where am I going to keep all

my different colored hats I never wear?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
Well, if you need another couch

to crash on, there's always my place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
-Didn't you move in with Ralph?

-Yeah, but I kept the old apartment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<p>
-Just in case, I guess.

-In case of what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<p>
-[faint chattering]

-What was that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
[yelps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<p>
Now, ladies, just calm down.

We can talk about this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
What are we gonna do, Princess Carolyn?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
[ants gasp]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
[chattering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
Did you say you're a princess?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
-That's just my name. I'm a manager.

-It's like an agent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
-It's totally different.

-Is it, though?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<p>
-Silence! You negotiate deals?

-Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
You could be of service, Manager Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
[ant leader laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
My hands... they're crushed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<p>
There's no way I can dig us back out now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<p>
Well, I can dig!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
Actually, no one should dig.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<p>
Your foundation is basically Swiss cheese.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<p>
The slightest provocation could cause

another collapse that would crush us all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<p>
[all gasp]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
I know that because I bought a sitcom

about fracking, <i>The Frack Shack.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<p>
It's <i>New Girl</i> meets fracking.

[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
Oh, God, no one's gonna watch

that show, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
Someone will be coming for us soon.

In the meantime, we must organize.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<p>
Parcel out food and water

and see how much we've got.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
-I'll assign team leaders.

-Oh, no. I'm sensing a shift in power.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
[guests chuckling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<p>
All right. Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
-God...!

-For you, a banana

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<p>
-because you're so appealing.

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
And for you, a radish. Enjoy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter, this is a disaster.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
I don't think so.

I'm food captain, and I am loving it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
-And who made you the food captain?

-Woodchuck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<p>
Exactly. He's in charge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
Excuse me,

you have not been allocated those rations.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<p>
I'm a horse. I need more food,

and I'm a celebrity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<p>
-Everyone down here is a celebrity.

-Not the caterers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
Relinquish the food.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<p>
Hey. Here's your chance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<p>
Actually, Woodchuck, this is my house

and BoJack can eat whatever he wants.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
This man has already reached

his allotted food portion for the day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
Who said we have to go by your rules?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<p>
Yeah, who made you leader

of underground?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
I'm just gonna take all this and...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
You've appointed me.

Yes, I under-- citizens, look...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
Keep it together.

[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
-Weird stuff going on downstairs.

-[clicking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
Humph.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
-I can't believe this is my life.

-Uh-oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<p>
Too much sad booze for you.

Where's the happy booze?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
I'm trapped underground

and it's all my husband's fault

and I'm gonna die in this mansion

in a mass grave with his ex-wives.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<p>
Okay. But on the bright side--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<p>
Look, Mr. Peanutbutter loves you,

you got a cool job, you got friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
Jesus, you're right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<p>
Even when I was above ground,

I wasn't satisfied.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
Oh, my God. I'm the problem!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<p>
[sobbing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<p>
Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<p>
What the...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<p>
Why can't I be happy? Am I busted?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<p>
No. It...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<p>
I am! I'm a pit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<p>
I'm a pit that good things fall into!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<p>
Diane, you're not a pit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
I'm a pit!

[sobbing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
I can't believe I'm crying.

This is so dumb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
It's okay.

Don't feel bad about feeling bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
You disappeared for a year and a half.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
So you do want to talk about it.

Just took four solid days of drinking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
If you were back in L.A.,

why didn't you call me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<p>
-I wasn't... ready.

-Ready? For what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
I wanted to be better

when you saw me again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
And I thought I could be, somehow.

But I'm not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<p>
And even if I did get better,

the best I could ever be

is still just some other version of me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
BoJack, I can't wait for you to be better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
I need you in my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<p>
-Really?

-You're the biggest asshole I know,

and you're the only thing

that makes sense to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<p>
[Diane sighs, moans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<p>
People should be able to have

some control over their lives down here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
-Yeah!

-People need boundaries.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<p>
Leadership means

sometimes being the bad guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:32" />

<p>
-That's not...

-That's a point for Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<p>
And I'm the good guy,

so that's two points for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<p>
What points? There are no points.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
-This is not a game!

-Well, maybe there should be points.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<p>
-Yeah!

-Points!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<p>
People seem to like my points idea.

That's another point for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
Well, I'm the one who came down here

to save you in the first place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<p>
Surely I get points for that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<p>
Asking for points is conceited.

That's more points for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
-He's right!

-What?!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<p>
If you came down to save us,

why are we still here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
[all] Yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<p>
You had one job, and you couldn't do it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
-Yeah!

-That's right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<p>
Minus point for Woodchuck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<p>
I implore you not to fall

into a mob mentality.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<p>
-He called us a mob! Let's kill him!

-Yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
Folks, Woodchuck's political philosophy

is as broken as his hands.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<p>
That is a convincing argument.

He does have broken hands.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<p>
Maybe it's time an outsider took control.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
An outsider like me,

the guy whose house this is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<p>

<p>
-BoJack.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<p>
-Did you know I can juggle?

-Cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<p>
Are you okay?

I mean, outside of our current situation

of being buried alive

and almost out of alcohol

except for cooking sherry and Midori?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<p>
It's just been a rough couple years

with Sarah Lynn dying and Herb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<p>
-And Corduroy?

-Cordu-what now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
Corduroy? Jackson-Jackson?

Died of autoerotic "asphyx-ization"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<p>
Oh, yeah, him too. And now I got this...

girl in my house, this... daughter-type.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<p>
You got daughter? Ruh-roh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
-[clatters]

-Yeah, I got daughter, "ruh-roh."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
Supposed to help her figure out

who her mother is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
But I don't know where to start.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
Did she try sending mutual consent form

to the adoption agency?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
What, what words?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<p>
Well, if it's closed adoption,

you send a mutual consent form.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
Basically says, "I wanna be open now!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<p>
If Mom says same thing,

boom-bah-boo! Smo-pen Sesame!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<p>
-How do you know about that?

-I had an adopted brother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<p>
And also for a while,

I hoped I was adopted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
-Ugh!

-Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<p>
-Whoa!

-Ooh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<p>
Who dares disturb Queen Antonia?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<p>
My name is Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
I represent the soldiers

of Subcolony K-147,

who feel they're doing all the work

while reaping none of the spoils.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
Everything my soldiers do

benefits the colony.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<p>
I had this same conversation

with Jeffrey Katzenberg.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<p>
Believe me, this doesn't end well

for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

What are your demands?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<p>
They want to have sex with your drones.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<p>
Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<p>
Oliver, assemble the small council.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
Uh, If we're gonna be down here a while,

can I get a new towel?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<p>
[guests chanting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<p>
Woodchuck's aa-always telling us

what to do!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
He says help is coming,

but how does he know? What if he's lying?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
[wails]

And I have still not been validated!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<p>
If you could all be patient...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<p>
We're sick of waiting!

It's time for new leadership.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
That attempted movie star is right!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
I declare Mr. Peanutbutter

President-for-life of Underground.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
[guests] Yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<p>
[grunting]

Uh, uh, oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
-Thank you!

-What? No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<p>
-What do we do with Woodchuck?

-He must be made an example of.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
-[man] Get him!

-Yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<p>
All right, guys, all right. Calm down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<p>
We don't need to "get him."

Let's just tie him up someplace

where he can't hurt us anymore

with his dangerous ideas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
Do not tie me up. That isn't necessary.

No, don't-- no...!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<p>
-[chanting] Peanutbutter!

-No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<p>
-Peanutbutter!

-Thank you, thank you all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>
As my first act as President-for-life,

I declare that everyone

is allowed to eat and drink

whatever they want!

<p>
[all] Yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
Agh--!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:16" />

<p>
I'm starving,

and not the normal celebrity

kind of starving like I always am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<p>
Or even red-carpet-season starving.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>
-Where's the food?

-[Woodchuck] You ate all the food.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<p>
This is it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<p>
Nobody's coming for us.

We need to kill someone for food.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<p>
-Hmm...!

-Oh...!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<p>
Let's eat Mr. Peanutbutter!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />

<p>
He has the word "peanut butter"

in his name!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<p>
[all] Yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<p>
Guys, guys, guys,

maybe we don't need to eat anybody!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
-[all groan]

-What's this now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<p>
Let's listen to the guy

who's saying don't kill me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<p>
He's got some interesting ideas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<p>
Listen to me, everyone. Please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<p>
I'm known for monologues

that sum things up at the end of the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<p>
I drive a Prius,

which means I'm a good person.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<p>
Let's not surrender

to our basest instincts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
I know times are tough,

but I'm sure if we band together

and really concentrate

on the problem at hand,

we can, as a group of friends--

[screams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<p>
-Oh, my God.

-Biel!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<p>
The rule of man is over.

Now begins the rule of fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<p>
-[howls] Oh, why?

-Jessica, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<p>
I will no longer be shackled

by the civilized society

of the above ground.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<p>
This is Underground,

and the only law here is flame.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
The fire wants not for justice.

The fire wants not for reason.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
-The fire desires only to be fed!

-Feed the fire!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
-The fire is my new god!

-[moans] Oh, God!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
I'm so sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter,

but the tide has turned

and I side with the fire now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
Tonight, we dine on Zach Braff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
-Tomorrow, canine cuisine!

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
You, take him to his spot,

and make him stay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
-[squawks]

-No! No! Please!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<p>
Listen to reason... this time!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<p>
[gulps] Ah-hh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<p>
I think that's all of it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<p>
I can't go back to my old life sober.

It's so empty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<p>
Okay, okay.

Here's the secret to being happy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<p>
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
Just pretend you are happy, and eventually

you'll forget you're pretending.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
Maybe you're right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<p>
I just need to stop complaining

and work harder.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<p>
Everyone else is doing it.

Why am I so special?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<p>
-[door bangs]

-Lock him in here!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
-Please! Diane, my sweet wife.

-What's going on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<p>
Marvin Gaye.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
The People of Underground

have a new god, the fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<p>
And for my crimes

I will be fed to its ravenous flames.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<p>
My only hope is the meat

of Zach Braff proves lasting,

but I fear by daybreak,

there will be no Braff meat left.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
-What's going on?

-Four Non-Blondes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
Everybody out except the prisoner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<p>
-[Diane] No!

-Easy on the merchandise!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
Get off me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<p>
Well, it's been a tough week,

lots of back and forth,

but I think we've reached an agreement

that meets everybody's needs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
"The queen will share

male sex servants with the soldiers

for one night of magnificent,

sensuous splendor,

a gorgeous bacchanal

of hedonistic delights,

with a second orgy pickup option,

pursuant on success of the first."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
[hissing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<p>
My clients are satisfied with those terms.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
Great. Now can we please return

to the surface world?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
All my favorite clouds are up there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
Oh, I like this one.

He's got moxie and a soft thorax.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
How did you find your fleshy self

in my kingdom, you pink marshmallow?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
We were at this big

Beverly Hills fundraiser.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
There was an earthquake,

and now everyone's trapped underground.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
Did you say Beverly Hills?

Ugh! Of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
Surface dwellers are always moving in

on our territory.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<p>
First they move here, then taxes go up,

the next thing you know,

there's a Whole Foods.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<p>
How am I supposed to concentrate

on a great orgy

when I've got gentrification on my mind?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
No, we've got to get

those interlopers out of here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
-Let's--

-Hey! Hold on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
-Uh...

-[Jessica] Mr. Peanutbutter,

did you or did you not tell us

we could eat whatever we wanted?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
[all] Peanutbutter!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<p>
Peanutbutter! Peanutbutter!

Peanutbutter!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<p>
We gotta do something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter's the only non-shitty

thing that's ever happened to me

and now they're gonna set him on fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<p>
Okay. What would non-hungover Diane do?

She's smart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
I don't know. I need water.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
There is no more water.

That's the problem.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
"Choodwuck" is right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
Wait, isn't there water, under the ground?

Like, a well?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<p>
-Yeah! And we're underground.

-If we dig, we'll get water!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
-Do not dig. The ground is very volatile.

-Quiet, sky rodent! To the shovels!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter, your time is nigh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
Any last words

before we light you on fire?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<p>
Yes, if I could just say,

"Don't light me on fire"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
The fire bends to no man's will.

Nothing can defeat the fire. Only--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<p>
[Diane] Water!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
[Jessica] What? [gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
-Oh, wow, it's really water.

-Water is stronger than fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
Wait, let's not really forget how-- ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
Water is my new god now!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<p>
Oh, boy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
-Clear gold!

-All right, water!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
H-2-Oh, boy, we hit the freaking jackpot!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
Hang on. It's-- it's not stopping.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<p>
Which is great!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<p>
You hit a pipe, you drunken imbeciles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<p>
H-2-Oh, no!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<p>
[guests whimpering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<p>
Well, I guess this is it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
-[bangs]

-Oh, God! It's another earthquake!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<p>
[all screaming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<p>
How is this happening?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<p>
[ants] Heave! Heave! Heave!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
Get them out of here!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
No! Please! I'm important down here!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
[guests]

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<p>
[crashes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />

<p>
Oh, what an eyesore.

The HOA will be hearing about this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
We are never talking

about any of this ever again. Whew.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<p>
So I will see you tomorrow.

We've got a rally in Bakersfield

and then we're touring

a tennis ball factory in Modesto.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<p>
-Hi.

-Hi.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<p>
You're the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<p>
-I don't tell you that enough.

-It's okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<p>
If this governor thing

is really important to you...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<p>
It's not. You saw me in there.

I'm a terrible leader.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<p>
I don't want to be governor.

I just wanted people to like me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<p>
Well, I like you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<p>
Come on, Diane, let's go home...

oh, right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<p>
Well, thanks for inviting me

to your party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
I had a wonderful time.

Evening really flew by.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<p>
Sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<p>
-You guys hungry?

-I could eat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<p>
-Ethiopian?

-Ooh, haven't done Ethiopian in a while.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<p>
I should go home.

I haven't seen my boyfriend in ten days.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:34" />

<p>
He's probably worried about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:35" />

<p>
I'm down for Ethiopian.

I love that sponge bread.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:39" />

<p>
-What do they call it, "injera"?

-Yeah, injera.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:41" />

<p>
-Injera, right.

-That's right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:45" />

<p>
Yeah, that's good bread.
