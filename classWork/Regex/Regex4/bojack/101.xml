<p>
{\an8}In 1987, the situation comedy

<i>Horsin' Around</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<p>
{\an8}premiered on ABC.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
The show, in which

a young, bachelor horse

is forced to reevaluate

his priorities

when he agrees to raise

three human children,

was initially dismissed

by critics

as broad and saccharine

and not good,

but the family comedy struck

a chord with America

and went on to air

for nine seasons.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<p>
The star of <i>Horsin' Around</i>,

BoJack Horseman,

is our guest tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<p>
Welcome, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
{\an8}It is good to be here,

Charlie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
{\an8}Sorry I was late.

The traffic--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
It's really no problem.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
I parked

in a handicapped spot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<p>
I hope that's okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<p>
You parked in a--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<p>
I'm sorry, disabled spot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
Is that the proper nomenclature?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
Maybe you should

move the car.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
No, I don't think

I should drive right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<p>
I'm incredibly drunk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
You're telling me

that you're drunk right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
Is it just me,

or am I nailing this interview?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<p>
I kind of feel like

I'm nailing it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<p>
Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<p>
Anyway, we were talking

about <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<p>
To what do you attribute

the show's wide appeal?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<p>
Charlie, listen, you know,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<p>
I know that it's very hip

these days

to shit

all over <i>Horsin' Around</i>,

but at the time,

I can tell you--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<p>
- Is it okay to say "shit"?

- Please don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<p>
'Cause I-- I think the show's

actually pretty solid

for what it is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<p>
It's not Ibsen, sure,

but look,

for a lot of people,

life is just one long,

hard kick in the urethra,

and sometimes

when you get home

from a long day of

getting kicked in the urethra,

you just want to watch a show

about good, likable people

who love each other,

where, you know,

no matter what happens,

at the end of 30 minutes,

everything's

gonna turn out okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<p>
You know,

because in real life--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<p>
Did I already say the thing

about the urethra?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:55" />

<p>
Well, let's talk

about real life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<p>
What have you been doing

since the show's cancellation

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:58" />

<p>
18 years ago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<p>
That's a great question,

Charlie.

<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<p>
I'm not afraid of commitment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
I commit to things

all the time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
It's the following through

on that commitment

that I take issue with.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
Hey, stupid, isn't that

your friend over there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
God, I hope he doesn't see us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<p>
Is that BoJack Horseman?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<p>
Oh, jeez, here we go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter

and BoJack Horseman

in the same room.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
What is this,

a crossover episode?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<p>
You know,

that gets funnier every time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
You're being sarcastic,

but I think it does actually

get funnier every time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<p>
We're actually in the middle

of breaking up right now,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
- so if you could just--

- Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<p>
- You're in the middle of it?

- Yeah, that's right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
So would it be awkward

if I joined you right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
Yes, actually,

it's very awkward.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
Is that not clear?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
Yeah, this is awkward

right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
Yes, please leave.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
How are you,

Mr. Peanutbutter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
Oh, living the dream, P.C.,

living the dream.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
Why are you

making conversation?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
Oh, let's see,

it's the English word--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
It's called being polite,

BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<p>
But am I crazy

that this is a bad time?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<p>
Always a Clydesdale,

never a Clyde, eh, BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
You'll get that one later,

man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
Erica, get out of here

with that face.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
Would it kill you to be civil?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<p>
This is why we're breaking up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<p>
So it's not because

of the thing with the baby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
It's because

of a lot of things!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
Waiter, could we please

have the check?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
- Thank you.

- We haven't even ordered yet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
I have wasted so many dinners

on you, BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<p>
I don't know how you can expect

anyone else to love you

when you so clearly

hate yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
- Here you go.

- Let me see that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<p>
<i>$10 for bread?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<p>
I don't want to live

in a society

where the premeal bread

isn't free.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
It is free

if you order a meal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<p>
Can you take me home, please?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<p>
Yeah, but I didn't even

eat that much bread.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<p>
What did I have?

I must have had--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
You ate nine baskets, sir.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<p>
Nine--

really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
Great, now I'm gonna feel like

a fat ass all week.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
You've seen me naked.

Do you think I'm getting chubby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
You want to know the real

reason we're breaking up?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<p>
What was that?

Sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
Couldn't hear you over the sound

of my calories not metabolizing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
This is so classic you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
You're using this bread thing

to avoid talking

about our relationship.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
No, that is definitely

not happening.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<p>
I'd like to go home now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<p>
You think I'm fat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
So yeah,

technically I was dumped,

but the real headline

of the evening was,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
"Dumb guy eats bread,

gets fat, the end."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<p>
What kind of headline

is that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<p>
Wasn't there a pizza here

a second ago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
God damn it!

Stop the presses.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
You're not fat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<p>
Oh, hey, let's throw a party.

That'll cheer you up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
No, it won't.

It'll cheer you up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<p>
I'll stand in the corner

by myself

eating cotton candy

until I barf

like I did at your last party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
Hey, aren't you the horse

from <i>Horsin' Around</i>?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
[retching]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
That was a good party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
Hey, didn't we get a cotton

candy machine for that party?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
Who told you Princess Carolyn

and I broke up?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
- She did.

- What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<p>
You never took me home, jerk!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
Oh, everything's my fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<p>
Take me home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
Okay, jeez.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
But I'm not looking

for parking in Silver Lake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
I'll slow the car down

to a crawl,

and you can duck and roll.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
You know what, you can take

a last look at this face,

because it's the last time

you're gonna see it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
Hey-up!

Hello?

<p>
<i>I've got Princess Carolyn</i>

<i>for you.</i>

</p>

Uh, okay.

<p>
<i>BoJack.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<p>
Oh, my God,

we just broke up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
Yeah, but I'm still

your agent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
I pride myself on my ability

to separate my professional life

from my personal life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<p>
Great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
Then, as my agent,

do you think I'm getting fat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
No way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<p>
You are in the prime of

your life, never looked better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
What about

as my ex-girlfriend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<p>
You look like a pile of crap

ate a second pile of crap

and then crapped out

a third pile of crap.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<p>
Wait, wait, so which pile

of crap do I look like?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
- The third one.

- What? That's the worst one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
I'm not calling you

as your ex.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<p>
I'm calling you

as your agent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

Remember that book

you're pretending to write?

<p>

<p>
Does Tuesday work for you,

or are you gonna be too busy

this week

masturbating to old pictures

of yourself?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
I told you, that's not

what was happening that time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<p>
I was masturbating to what

the picture represented.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
You walked in

at the worst possible moment!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<p>
So, Tuesday, though?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
Yes, fine!

<p>
You don't have anything?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<p>
Hey, you got

the electricity back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
Good for you.

Ever hear

of a young adult franchise

called the Swamp Monsters

of Malibu?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
Uh, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<p>
Then why did we spend

$20 million on marketing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<p>
It's okay, Pinky,

go to your happy place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<p>
Uh...

<p>
Look, I know

you're a busy guy.

<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<p>
Actually, I am a busy guy.

I mean, there was this one time

I came close in the '90s,

but then those

write your book

and be done with it?
