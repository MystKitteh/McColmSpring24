<p>
As your accountant,

I felt it necessary to do this in person.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
Us, too. Because we're really

accounting on you...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<p>
-No.

-to get in on the ground floor of this...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
No, don't do this. Please, God, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
...PB Livin' product.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<p>
Has this ever happened to you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
Whatever it is, it hasn't happened.

Nothing has ever happened to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
-You say you love a toasted bagel.

-I would never say that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
-I have celiac disease.

-Ding. Bagel's ready.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
-But wait.

-Son of a--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
-Hey. That bagel was too fast.

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<p>
That's why PB Livin' presents,

the Bagel Catcher.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<p>
-For all those hard-to-catch bagels.

-No, no. Stop. Enough. Enough.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
Stop talking! I can't take it anymore!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
PB Livin' is filing for bankruptcy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<p>
-I'm shutting you down.

-I thought you were a customer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
I don't get what's happening.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
What's happening is you two knuckleheads

threw thousands of dollars

into a bunch of dumb ideas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
You paid 50 grand

to a bunch of kindergartners

for the movie rights

to the game "tag."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
Our business manager

was over the moon for that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<p>
Business manager?

Who the hell is your business manager?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<p>
Business-wise, this all seems

like appropriate business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<p>
You two are done.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<p>
This company is more in the red

than <i>Carrie </i>on prom night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
So, what you're saying is, we're just

one great idea away from breaking even?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<p>
No. You're-- [grunts]

You are out of money.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

you need to get a job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<p>
-Are you hiring at your accounting firm?

-Dude, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<p>
I'm waiting for my agent.

He'll be with me any moment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter is going back to work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<p>
Yeah. He's probably just organizing

all the amazing opportunities.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

<p>
I haven't heard from him in years,

so they've probably been piling up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:53" />

<p>
Maybe I should just go check on him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:55" />

<p>
[knocking on door]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<p>
Hello, Ronnie? It's your favorite client,

Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<p>
Well, I'm coming in. I hope you're--

Oh! Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:03" />

<p>
{\an8}Ronnie, how'd you get that belt

around your neck,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:05" />

<p>
{\an8}then caught on the filing cabinet,

which made your pants fall down

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<p>
{\an8}while you were researching pornograph--

Oh, I see what happened here.

</p>

Morning time, Hollywoo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<p>
{\an8}-I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type.

-And I'm Some Lady.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<p>
{\an8}Here's a thing written on a card.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
Last night, major Hollywoo agent Ronnie

Bonito was found dead in his office...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
Ruh-roh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<p>
...in what authorities are calling

a mishap of a sexual nature.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<p>
-What does that mean?

-You know, auto-erotic asphyxiation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<p>
Auto-a-what's it who's it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<p>
Oh, is that that thing

where you strangle yourself

in an attempt to heighten

sexual arousal?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
It sure is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<p>
<i>Coming up, a food truck that serves</i>

<i>just one thing: gravy.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
{\an8}Did you hear that? New food truck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
{\an8}-We should go.

-I'm in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
Hey, can I get some lunch money?

It's pizza day today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<p>
Sure thing, sport.

Wait, where is it pizza day?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
-In my tummy.

-Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
{\an8}Hey, BoJack, would you zip me up?

My shoulder is killing me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm not sleeping right.

We need to do something about that bed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
Just because I'm nocturnal

doesn't mean I wanna be up all night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
{\an8}-I propped it up with a Golden Globe.

-It still wobbles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
{\an8}-Yeah. Anyway, I got you something.

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
A beeper? BoJack, it's great,

but you know, I already have one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<p>
Yeah, you have a beeper, but I don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
Now, you can page me

whenever you want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
Huh. BoJack, I love it,

and you're gonna love it, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<p>
There's all kinds of codes

we can send each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<p>
"Zero, zero, zero" is "call me,"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<p>
{\an8}and "1-2-3" is "I miss you"

and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
{\an8}What? Boobs? Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
{\an8}What scamp came up with that one?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
{\an8}Okay, I gotta go. Dinner tonight?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
{\an8}Totally. Let's hit that gravy truck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
{\an8}Okay, love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<p>
No, I don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<p>
{\an8}Aw... "I love you. No, I don't"?

{\an8}Uh... Keys.

<p>
Ooh. Ah. Ee. Ow.

</p>

<p>
Goddam it. No. No. Ow.

</p>

<p>
Oh. Ow. Oh...

</p>

<p>
{\an8}Coffee? Hup.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<p>
{\an8}Rutabaga, this day already sucks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<p>
{\an8}My heel broke

while I was at this new food truck,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<p>
{\an8}and I spilled a handful of gravy

all over myself

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<p>
{\an8}because they don't sell bowls,

just gravy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<p>
{\an8}Should've gone to the bowl truck first.

That's where they get you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, I guess the upside to being

invisible around here

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
{\an8}is that none of these assholes

will ever notice what a mess I am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

I see what a mess you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
[chuckles] Aw...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<p>
{\an8}Do you need the movie-star speech?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
{\an8}No, no, I'll be okay.

And how are you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<p>
Gotta look at paint for the new kitchen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
I have to pick a shade that won't clash

with the splatter of blood

from when I blow my brains out

after talking to Katie

about paint swatches all day. [laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<p>
We do have fun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<p>
So, what's the plan for today?

Find a new agent, go on auditions?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<p>
No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed me

<i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House, </i>oh, so long ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
Wander around L.A. with an open mind

and an empty stomach

until I get discovered.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<p>
But also, like, find a new agent

and go on auditions, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<p>
Or should I start stealing food

from work?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<p>
I'm just gonna go with the flow

and leave everything up to destiny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
-Que sera quesadilla.

-You know we could lose the house, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<p>
-[laughs] Diane.

-Right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
Diane, Diane, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
[door opens then closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<p>
-Diane.

-Aah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
I wasn't stealing paper towels

to use as dinner napkins. Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<p>
Here's a funny question for you:

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
If Mr. Peanutbutter said,

"I love you. No, I don't,"

would you need to talk about that later

and figure out what he meant?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<p>
Probably not, right?

Because they're meaningless words?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<p>
I mean, language evolves, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
How can anyone know

what anything means?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
The answer is nobody can.

Nothing means anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
So why bother talking about anything?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
In this scenario, are Mr. Peanutbutter

and I living in our house?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
Or are we squatting in an abandoned

Barnes &amp; Noble burning books to keep warm

as we struggle through

our Dickensian-style poverty?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<p>
[beeper plays ringtone]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<p>
"Zero, zero, zero."

No idea what that means.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<p>
I think it means "call me."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
Ignore. Wait, where's the ignore button?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
How do I ignore?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
I think with a beeper, you just ignore it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<p>
-With what, my mind?

-You seem a little stressed out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<p>
That's because

as soon as I'm done with work,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
I have to have a long,

awkward conversation

with Wanda about our relationship,

unless... I'm never done with work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<p>
Diane, you magnificent bastard. That's it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<p>
I'll be out there in the stands.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<p>
And I'll be rooting for you, Secretariat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
Mm. Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<p>
Your line is,

"And I'll see you at the finish line."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
Yeah, I know. I'm acting.

Great. Now I gotta start all over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
Settle in, folks.

We could be here a while.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
-Ow! Ooh.

-Ah, Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<p>
So good of you to join us eventually.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<p>
Sorry I'm late. I had the worst morning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<p>
You know who had an even

"the worst-er" morning?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
-Ronnie Bonito. Because he's dead.

-He is?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:29" />

<p>
He decided to strangle the dirty dangle

and now that sweet chariot

has come for to carry him home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<p>
Everyone who was here on time

is taking a moment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
-Of silence?

-Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
Also to reach out to his former clients.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
-To offer their condolences?

-Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
Also to recruit them to the Vigor roster.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
-A Vigor agent is a vigorous agent.

-Who do you want me to call?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<p>
I have ins with a bunch of Bonito's

clients including all the major J's:

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<p>
-Law, Lo, Leno, and J. Abrams.

-Oh, that's wonderful news

in the parallel universe

in which you were on time today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
In this reality, however, we're all good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
You can lap up the leftovers though.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<p>
-"Mr. Peanutbutter"?

-Oh, and Princess Carolyn?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
Get your shoe fixed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<p>
You look like a woman

from an '80s deodorant commercial.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
[inhales sharply]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Here I go.

Destiny, don't fail me now. [grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<p>
Yeah. Hitting the pavement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
This is how it happens for a guy like me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<p>
[grunts] Ew...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
Out of my way, flyer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<p>
Ugh. Flyer. Why do you have to be

on my shoe in front of this store?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<p>
Wait, a second. Shoe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<p>
Store.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
Shoe store? Shoe store.

</p>

<p>
"Team players wanted"?

</p>

<p>
Oh, I'm such a good team player,

</p>

<p>

look like garbage.

line.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
Great, we got it. We got one take.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<p>
And now we gotta stop for the day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<p>
What? No. Why stop now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<p>
-I'm just getting warmed up.

-Union rules. We're done. Go home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<p>
Go home?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<p>
Why go home when we could extend

this long day's journey into night?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
-Drinks on me, folks.

-I could use a drink.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<p>
-Or six.

-Great, Corduroy's driving. Let's go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<p>
[Corduroy] Ah...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<p>
-I really needed this, BoJack.

-Me, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
Yeah, man.

This day's been really hard on me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
Ever since I heard about that agent

who died from that blue-face blastoff?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<p>
-Blue-face blastoff?

-The strokey chokey?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
-The two-neck squeeze?

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
You know, the one hand

on the Adam's apple,

the other one's

on the Adam's banana?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
Oh, right. Right. Yeah. The auto-erotic--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
That could've been me.

I used to really be into that stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
I was a hardcore gasper.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<p>
Can't believe you have

so many names for it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
Now I can't stop thinking about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<p>
I shouldn't even be alive right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<p>
Don't need to talk about

how you masturbate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
-The orgasms you get--

-Okay, I guess we do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
It's like seeing a rainbow,

but with all the colors.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<p>
-So, like a normal rainbow?

-But it's too dangerous, man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
They say if you bite down on a lemon

right at the point of climax,

the lemon juice gives you the jolt

you need to not pass out and die.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<p>
But still man,

you're just... rolling the dice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<p>
Okay, this is getting really graphic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<p>
Can we maybe

talk about anything else?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<p>
-Sure.

-Thank God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<p>
Hey, man, it's funny you should mention

God, because my new thing is... the Bible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
Tell me, have you accepted Jesus Christ

as your Lord and personal savior?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
So, noose-wise, what are we talking?

You use a standard sailor's knot

or more like your average

birthday-present bow?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<p>
[grunting softly]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<p>
-I beeped you, BoJack.

-Oh, hey. About this morning--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
-It's fine.

-Because when I said that--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<p>
I said it's fine. You don't love me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
That's okay. I don't love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<p>
-What?

-Good night.

{\an8}On today's show,

I sit down with Hank Hippopopalous

</p>

<p>
Can you talk about your process?

<p>
{\an8}When I see someone,

and I think they can dance,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
{\an8}I say,

"Hey, I think you can dance."

</p>

<p>
And when I think they can't dance,

I say, "No, I don't think you can dance."

<p>
You don't love me, I don't love you.

<p>
We're having a good time. It's fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
Can't just say, "I don't love you"

to someone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<p>
-You said it to me.

-Yeah, but that was different.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
-How was that different?

-Because you do love me. Right?

</p>

-No.

I was thinking about you last night

while Katie and I were locked in a

fascinating debate about counter granite.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
And what if I told you I used to work

Ronnie Bonito's desk,

and I happen to know

that he had a client so hush-hush,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<p>
-it wasn't even on the master list.

-What? Who? Tell me. Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
[alarm ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<p>
Beloved novelist J.D. Salinger. What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
The author of <i>Catcher in the Rye?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
-And... others?

-Yuh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<p>
-Isn't he dead?

-He's "reclusive."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
Dude wanted to be left alone so much,

he faked his own death.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<p>
Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
Why are you giving this lead to me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<p>
-Because I like you, dummy.

-Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
Now we gotta wait for the fire department

to come let us out of this elevator.

</p>

<p>
-Hey.

-Corduroy, what are you doing here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
I need a favor.

Can you hold on to this for me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<p>
-Ew. Is this your Bible?

-No, no, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<p>
-It's my choking-off kit.

-Your kit?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<p>
Yeah. It has all my supplies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<p>
Silk ties, a leather gag, velvet sock.

Lemon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
You gotta take this off my hands.

I can't trust myself with this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<p>
I don't know if I want

your jack-off kit at my house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
Please. I got this girlfriend.

She loves me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<p>
If I fall back into the old gasp-and-goo,

it'll break her heart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<p>
Wait. So, you're saying

if someone loves you,

they don't want you to choke yourself

while masturbating?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<p>
Yeah. It's really dangerous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
-All right. I'll take it.

-Thanks, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
I still don't understand

why you need a kit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<p>
Can't you just use,

like, a belt or a rope?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<p>
Oh, I guess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<p>
I mean, I guess you could use anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
I mean, you could use an iPhone charger,

a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
[Carolyn] Hm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<p>
Oh. Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<p>
-Oh, hello. I'm looking for some--

-Sorry, no looking allowed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<p>
This store is for customers only.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<p>
Okay, then, I would like to buy a bicycle.

What would you recommend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:34" />

<p>
-One with a bell, or--?

-You got me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<p>
I don't know anything about bicycles.

I'm J.D. Salinger. I faked my own death.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<p>
Mr. Salinger. Such a pleasure.

Princess Carolyn, big fan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<p>
Let me guess, <i>Catcher in the Rye?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<p>
And others.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<p>
-I wanna say <i>The Hobbi--</i>

-Nope.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<p>
Look. I'm an agent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
It doesn't matter

whether I've read your work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<p>
What matters is I can look you

in the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<p>
The world is ready for your comeback,

and I wanna help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
No, thank you. Not interested.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<p>
Did that before, didn't work out well.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<p>
Fans were relentless.

The critics were cruel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<p>
And that's why my motto is,

"It's better to be alone."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
Which, come to think of it,

is probably why I don't sell

a lot of tandem bicycles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
But, J.D. Salinger,

you are J.D. Salinger.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
You are a goddamn American treasure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
But every time I go out in the world,

people hound me about my books.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<p>
Well, book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<p>
What if I told you there was a place

where no one reads books?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:29" />

<p>
I'm listening.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
A place where people only read

headlines, lists and pictures.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
A place where people

hate reading so much,

they hire others to do it for them

and don't even pay a living wage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<p>
What do you mean,

like, modern reading slaves?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<p>
Exactly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
And all those modern reading slaves

really wanna be doing

is writing things that, one day,

other people will also avoid reading.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
-Does such a place truly exist?

-Come with me, J.D. Salinger.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<p>
Let's go to Hollywoo.

<p>
-We need to talk.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:11" />

<p>
You're probably wondering

what this beautiful mahogany box is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<p>
-I wasn't wondering that.

-It's my auto-erotic asphyxiation kit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:17" />

<p>
I've decided to do the funky Spider-Man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<p>
-What? Funky Spider-Man?

-I came up with that one myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<p>
Because he hangs,

then he shoots webbing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
Wait. Are you saying you want to

auto-erotic asphyxiate yourself?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
Yes. I do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<p>
Even though it's very dangerous

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
-and I could die.

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
Now, if you love me, you probably

wouldn't want me to do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<p>
-Okay. I get it.

-Since you don't, I should do it, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<p>
I mean, there's no reason not to...

unless you love me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
-Do it.

-Wait. Seriously?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
Seems like you've already

made up your mind.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<p>
If you're that set on it,

knock yourself out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<p>
[laughs] Only if I do it wrong.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
Because as I mentioned before,

it's very dangerous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
-Have fun.

-I'm serious. I'm really gonna do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
Great. Put a towel down.

Not one of the good ones.

<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
His spare lyricism

and devotion to character

will undoubtedly translate into

a penetrating dramatic work for this,

the golden age of television writing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
J.D. Take it away.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
I wanna do a show where people

ask celebrities trivia questions.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<p>
-What?

-Like a game show?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<p>
Yeah. You know because

since they're famous people,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<p>
I think normal people would wanna see

if they know trivia and stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<p>
You know, like, Hollywoo stars

and celebrities, what do they know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
Do they know things? Let's find out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
What a hoot. I love it, and I don't

use that word with just anybody.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<p>
What do you call it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
I call it <i>Hollywoo Stars and</i>

<i>Celebrities: What Do They Know?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<p>
<i>Do They Know Things?</i>

<i>Let's Find Out.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<p>
It's maybe more of a working title.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<p>
I can see it on the marquee already.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<p>
-Must be a long marquee.

-It's long.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<p>
Yeah, yeah. The celebrities

can also do physical challenges.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
Oh, it's perfect.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<p>
We've been searching for a companion

for <i>Hey, I Think You Can Dance.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<p>
But wait, wait one second.

Who's gonna host?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<p>
Huh. I've got the perfect guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
Who wants to be in Nike Airs?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
Claire, you are looking off the charts

"gorge" in those tennis shoes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<p>
But let me ask you this:

Would you like to buy a towel?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
Because I'm throwing one in for free.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
-He's perfect.

-[Wanda] Mm-hm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<p>
How would you like to be the host of

J.D. Salinger's new celebrity game show?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
What? I knew destiny had a plan for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<p>
You know, it just goes to show,

with the right attitude,

every single one of your dreams

will always come true.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
And if your dreams don't come true,

it's probably because you just

didn't have the right attitude.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
Today, one agent did something

that no one else could.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
I'll give you two hints: catcher and rye.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<p>
Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
Charley Witherspoon caught a rye bagel

coming out of the toaster.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
-Come again?

-It was coming fast and hot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
One day, some genius will invent

some sort of bagel catcher

that takes the guesswork out of this task,

but until then, Charley gets a gold star.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<p>
-Thanks, Dad. I mean, Mr. Dad.

-Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<p>
Oh, boy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
Still alive? Because auto-erotic

asphyxiation is so risky?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<p>
Well, here I am, for now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
BoJack... Wait.

Did you fix the bed?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
Yeah. I was at the hardware store

picking up supplies for my auto-erotic

asphyxiation machine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
Because, as you are aware,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<p>
I'm preparing to auto-erotic

asphyxiate myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<p>
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so you

could at least get a good night's sleep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<p>
Okay, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<p>
Wanna talk about

the elephant in the room?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
Wow. Okay. You know what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<p>
You know what? Here's-- First of all--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<p>
Wow. All right, I can't even-- [groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
You know what? I-- [scoffs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<p>
Wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
He is never gonna forget that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<p>
What is this all about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
This isn't about anything but

the pursuit of the kind of orgasm

that feels like a rainbow

with every color.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<p>
-So, a regular rainbow.

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<p>
So, if you don't mind,

as long as you don't love me,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<p>
I have a noose to step into.

[clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<p>
I just need to release this lever,

drop these bags of sand,

which act as counterweights,

and then just pull this nozzle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
-Perfect.

-Okay. Have fun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
-Wait, Wanda. [grunting and choking]

-Okay, fine, you stupid baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<p>
I love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
I-- [coughs] I knew it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<p>
But I'm not going to tell you

not to do the funky Spider-Man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<p>
-[coughs] What?

-You need to be responsible for yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<p>
-That doesn't sound like me.

-I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<p>
But if you love me, too,

you won't do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
[gasps then grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<p>
-I thought so.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<p>
Just for the record, I never really

wanted to do this in the first place,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<p>
Me not doing it

is not a sign that I love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<p>
-It's just because I'm a coward.

-[chuckles] Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<p>
-I don't love you.

-Sure, you don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
I don't. Come back here.

I don't love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<p>
You don't make me feel less broken.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<p>
I don't get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<p>
I singlehandedly got a Lady Footlocker

store employee a primetime show

and resurrected a certified dead man

and nobody cared.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
-Why do I do anything?

-[Rutabaga over phone] <i>Hey.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<p>
Do you need the movie star speech?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />

<p>
[sighs] Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<p>
Okay.

Carolyn, you are the star of a movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
This is the part of the movie

where you get your heart broken.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<p>
<i>Where the world tests you,</i>

<i>and people treat you like shit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<p>
But it has to happen this way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<p>
Otherwise, the end of the movie,

when you get everything you want,

won't feel as rewarding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<p>
There are assholes out there,

but in the end, they don't matter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<p>
<i>Because this movie's not about them.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<p>
<i>It's never been about them.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
<i>All this time, the movie's been about you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<p>
Thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<p>
-Carolyn?

-Yes, Rutabaga?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:27" />

<p>
I think Katie and I are getting a divorce.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<p>
Corduroy? I don't want this thing anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:34" />

<p>
Corduroy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:36" />

<p>
Hey, you decent, man?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:38" />

<p>
[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:39" />

<p>
Oh, sweet Jesus.
