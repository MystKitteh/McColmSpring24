<p>
[Diane] The series is called

Crooshing USA.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:07" />

<p>
[man] <i>What does that mean?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:09" />

<p>
Crooshness is hard to define,

but I also don't know it when I see it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<p>
Oop. Pardon my reach.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<p>
Well, I'm always trying to get more girls

interested in agriculture.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<p>
You might say I've got my eyes on them.

Potato eyes, that is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<p>
-Guy?

-[Guy] Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<p>
Hey, girls! It's Diane,

outside Idaho's largest potato supplier,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
-Starch Farms.

-Hello!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<p>
Let me get this straight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
Your farm harvests five types of potatoes,

two types of onions,

and is also a front

for a local sex trafficking ring?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
-[gasps]

-How'd you get started in sex trafficking?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<p>
[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
I don't think

I'm getting that microphone back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>This is the second straight year</i>

<i>this Michigan resort's food</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>has tested positive for avian botulism.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Wow, two years in a row.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>It's like the Tom Hanks</i>

<i>of poisoning people.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>They said the jewelry is safe</i>

<i>for humans now,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>but I've been wearing this</i>

<i>for a week, and...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<p>
{\an8}[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
{\an8}Can we get more B-roll

so we have something to cut away to

when I have to scratch my nose?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
I thought scratching your nose

was your way of saying hello to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Don't you find it a little convenient</i>

<i>that the mayor has yet to restore</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>clean drinking water to this part of--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>No, it's quite in-convenient.</i>

<i>You think this is convenient?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
The East Side is a lower-income area,

ergo the residents

are not huge campaign donors, ergo--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<p>
No, the mayor

didn't target that neighborhood,

he was just that stupid

when it came to water filtration.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<p>
He was just stupid enough to think

he wouldn't get caught, ergo--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<p>
Say "ergo" one more time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<p>
-Ergo.

-Nah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<p>
-No, no, no, no.

-[Diane giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>This is Diane Nguyen...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>This is Diane... This is Di...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>This is Diane Nguyen,</i>

<i>and that's the </i>Croosh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:43" />

<p>
-[Guy mumbles] Let me see.

-Did you hear

about Philip Morris Disney Fox

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:46" />

<p>
AT&amp;T AOL Time Warner PepsiCo

Haliburton Skynet Toyota Trader Joe's?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<p>
-What about them?

-They got acquired by Whitewhale.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<p>
Oh, shit.

Well, how many companies are there now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:55" />

<p>
Four? [gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<p>
-What is it?

-I'm sorry, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:58" />

<p>
Look, I asked for two beds, I swear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<p>
-Huh.

-I mean, this is unprofessional. One bed!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />

<p>
What are we supposed to do

with just one bed?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<p>
Quite a pickle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:08" />

<p>
I should march right back down

to that front desk and tell them--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:11" />

<p>
[both moaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<p>
Thank you... [chuckles]

for helping me with my one bed bit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<p>
-[both moan]

-It's a good bit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:18" />

<p>
[BoJack's voice] <i>Dear Diane, hello.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
-[Guy snores]

<i>-This is a letter.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
<i>Rehab is making me write a letter</i>

<i>to a friend</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
<i>because I guess letter writing</i>

<i>is therapeutic?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<p>
<i>I hear it did wonders</i>

<i>for the Zodiac killer.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<p>
<i>Anyway, rehab's going fine.</i>

<i>A lot of hikes and movie nights and yoga,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<p>
<i>and I think next week,</i>

<i>we're doing a color war.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<p>
<i>And it's good that I'm here,</i>

<i>and it's good that I'm not drinking</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<p>
<i>or taking pills, but I keep thinking</i>

<i>about how this isn't real life.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<p>
<i>It's summer camp. Temporary. Easy.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
<i>As nice as this is, I know that someday</i>

<i>I'll have to go back to the real world.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
Hey, Lady, listen, can you put him

on the phone, please?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<p>
I don't care if he doesn't wanna

talk to me. I'm his father. No, Lady--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
[Guy groans angrily]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
[BoJack's voice] <i>Anyway, that's my letter.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
<i>I probably won't even send it,</i>

<i>but if you're reading this, I guess I did?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
<i>Your friend, BoJack.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
<i>P.S. Horseman.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm only in Chicago for a week.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
{\an8}I don't think it's selfish

to wanna see my son.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
{\an8}Yeah, but you gotta give your ex notice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<p>
{\an8}Whose side are you on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<p>
{\an8}Uh... Hey, look out the window.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
{\an8}[Guy] Wow, there she is!

</p>

<p>
{\an8}The second windy, muddy,

big-shoulders city by the lake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<p>
Look! Willis Tower.

Oh, and look, the new Whitewhale building!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<p>
You cannot be excited

about a giant corporation like Whitewhale

setting up shop in your hometown.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
I'm just excited

we got a new big building.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
{\an8}-In your face, Dubai.

-[chuckles]

</p>

<p>
{\an8}[man gasps and pants]

<p>
-Hmm...

-Ah...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<p>
{\an8}-Not bad.

-It's because the bread

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<p>
{\an8}is made from lake water and lard.

<p>
{\an8}<i>Today, your phone is ringing.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Here's what you need to know about people</i>

<i>who still use their phone to call people.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<p>
Hey, Stefani.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
Hey, girl!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<p>
-No, no, it's Guy.

<i>-</i>[Stefani] <i>Hey, Guy!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
I got you on speaker. Diane's eating

the best sandwich of her life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<p>
-It's okay.

-[Stefani exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
Diane, I love

that you still eat sandwiches.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
Flaws like that are what make you

relatable to regular women.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
-[gulps] What?

-Meanwhile,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<p>
I am adoring your cross-country exposition

of the ugly underbelly

of American capitalism.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
{\an8}So croosh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
{\an8}But I wonder if you could make room

in the rotation

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
{\an8}for a few feel-good stories?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
Stefani, our videos

are making a difference.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<p>
Yeah, a difference in how bummed I am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
There's gotta be some good news out there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
-[sighs]

-We'll see what we can do!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<p>
-Why'd you say yes?

-We can do feel-good stories.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<p>
What about that girl who opened up

a lemonade stand

to pay for her dad's cancer treatment?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<p>
How is that a feel-good story?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
"Hey, America! We're the only developed

nation without subsidized healthcare,

so this child joined

the workforce in a desperate bid

to keep her father alive!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
Okay. How 'bout this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<p>
{\an8}Local cameraman has a pretty

good thing going,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<p>
{\an8}where he gets to travel

all over the country

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
{\an8}and fool around in hotel rooms with

his beautiful, smart, feisty producer...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
{\an8}and he's pretty sure

this passionate, intelligent,

warrior for truth likes it too,

so maybe these two knuckleheads

should swallow their pride for a second

and make some feel-good videos.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
Hey, girls.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<p>
-Hey, Diane.

-Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
Tell me

about the Every Animal Girl Company.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
We are two best friends

who got tired of seeing dolls

promoting unrealistic beauty standards.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
Take Ginny here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<p>
Most giraffe dolls have necks

one inch shorter by scale

than the average girl giraffe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
Not our Ginny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<p>
Her neck is long and proud,

for all our necky gals out there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
As a necky gal, I love that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<p>
And is it true that all your dolls

are made out of recycled material?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
-Uh... No.

-Yes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
-Sorry?

-Well, traditionally...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
-[overlapping dialogue]

-The first batch, um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
The important thing is

we're two best friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<p>
Okay, what's going on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<p>
Uh... [giggles nervously]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<p>
Okay. We are excited to announce

that as of today,

the Every Animal Girl Company

has been purchased by Toys Galore,

a subsidiary

of Whitewhale Consolidated Interests.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
Yay! Toys Galore!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<p>
-Uh...

-Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<p>
"Yay..."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<p>
A small, independent start-up

bought out by a huge conglomerate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
It must be so empowering

to see your success grow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
What a happy story for two best friends.

Now, about the recycled materials?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<p>
Well, it's unclear what role recycling

will play in the future of this company.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
Right now, we're mainly focused

on empowering young girls

and closing the main Chicago factory

so we can relocate overseas

for cheaper labor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<p>
Right before the holidays!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<p>
[clears throat] Feel-good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<p>
[strained] What an exciting,

empowering time for you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<p>
I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<p>
You think you can edit that down

into something feel-goody?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
For sure.

It'll have to go up late, though,

because I'm having some friends over

to watch the game tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<p>
God, I'm freezing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
-Aw.

-So, you, uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
-You wanna watch the game with us?

-Are you asking me to meet your friends?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<p>
No, I just figure,

since you're staying with me anyway--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<p>
I would be delighted. Wait, it's not

the Chicago Baby Humans game, is it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<p>
It's just a mascot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<p>
[reporter] <i>And there goes Waa-Waa,</i>

<i>the Baby Human, stumbling around</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<p>
<i>like the furless, featherless dolt he is.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<p>
<i>What's he got there?</i>

<i>Don't drink that poison, you crazy human!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
-We don't drink poison.

-Diane, he's not a literal human.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
Waa-Waa is a tribute

to your proud human heritage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
-I'm very flattered.

-Anyway, meet the gang.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<p>
Everyone, this is Diane. My, um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
Ah... You know, my--

The woman that I work with.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<p>
-[all] Hi.

-[man] 'Sup, dude?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<p>
-Hmm...

-You okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<p>
Yeah. Sorry, just-- I'll be right back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<p>
[doorbell rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
-Diane, I'm really sorry, but--

-It's fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
I wasn't expecting, ya know,

in front of your friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<p>
-He just showed up.

-We haven't put a label on us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
-I'm not looking for--

-The speech and debate tournament

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
-was canceled on account of cyberbullying.

-Wait, what are you talking about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
-My son is here. He surprised me.

-Oh, shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<p>
I usually don't bring women around my kid

unless it's serious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
-I get it.

-Do you mind staying at a hotel?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
-Oh, yeah. Totally.

-He'll be gone first thing tomorrow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
What if he sees me go out?

Is the coast clear?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<p>
-You should maybe go out the window.

-[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<p>
This makes sense. But what about my stuff?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
I'll pack your bag

and throw it out to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<p>
Okay, good. Bye.

Thank you for inviting me to your party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
You have a lovely home.

<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
<i>Today sucks. There's this new lady here,</i>

<i>Beverly, and she took my snack kit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<p>
<i>And that is so classic Beverly.</i>

<i>Probably. I just met her.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
<i>The whole point of the snack kits</i>

<i>is they're communal, right?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
<i>They're these bags full of snacks</i>

<i>that we take on our morning hikes,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
<i>and we put them together the night before</i>

<i>as, like, a team-building thing.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
<i>Yesterday, I decided to throw an extra bag</i>

<i>of candied nuts into a snack kit,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
<i>something just for me.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
<i>And I marked my bag with a "B"</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
<i>so I'd know which one to grab</i>

<i>in the morning.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<p>
<i>"B" for "BoJack."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<p>
-[groans angrily]

<i>-But then today, I see Beverly,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
<i>who, again, just got here,</i>

<i>waltzing around the house</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<p>
<i>with my snack kit, saying, "Oh, somebody</i>

<i>made a special kit just for me!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<p>
<i>B for Beverly!</i>

<i>I must have a secret admirer!"</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<p>
<i>Again, just got here!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
-[shivering]

<i>-The story of my life</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
<i>is that I never get anything nice.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<p>
<i>You'd think that I'd learn to adjust</i>

<i>my expectations by now.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
<i>But, no. Once again,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
<i>I was the idiot</i>

<i>who got my hopes up about candied nuts,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
<i>and now I am disappointed</i>

<i>with no one to blame but myself.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<p>
-[sighs]

<i>-Anyway, what's new with you?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
[scoffs]<i> Just kidding,</i>

<i>you can't say anything, this is a letter!</i>

</p>

<p>
-Hello?

-[Stefani] <i>Diane, your last video--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<p>
Okay, I know it wasn't as feel-good

<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
Are you kidding? I feel great!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
You made a big impression with the guys

at Whitewhale.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
-Really?

-I'll say. They bought Girl Croosh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<p>
-What?

-Well, technically they bought Fuddruckers

and merged it with Dow Chemical to create

a new media venture called Spronk!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
<i>-</i>[Diane] <i>Hold on--</i>

-Spronk acquired Univision,

which will incorporate Girl Croosh

into the Gizmodo-branded mist

of advertorial.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
-That's terrible!

-Not for me! I'm gonna be rich!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<p>
-You already are rich!

-Oh, yeah! [giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<p>
Oops. Well, anyway, good luck with Spronk,

which is currently rebranding

as Content Spew.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<p>
So spew that content, girl! [giggles]

</p>

Uh, I think we're good.

<p>
<i>Who? Why? Where?</i>

<p>
{\an8}<i>And I'm Ollie, the Oligopoly.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<p>
<i>You summoned us here to tell your new</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<p>
<i>Well, best be quick about it,</i>

<i>you unholy apparitions.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
<i>The Whitewhale Way was developed</i>

<i>by Ezekiel Whitewhale,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<p>
<i>who started small with a modest petroleum</i>

<i>refinery he inherited from his father.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
[Ollie]

<i>One day he looked around and said,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
<i>"Wait one minute!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
<i>While I'm refining this oil, someone else</i>

<i>is getting rich drilling it,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
<i>and another someone's sellin' it</i>

<i>to the common commuter!"</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
<i>So, he bought his own rig</i>

<i>and opened a chain of gas stations.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
<i>By controlling both the means</i>

<i>of production and the delivery system,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<p>
<i>Ezekiel cornered the market</i>

<i>and choked out the competition</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<p>
<i>until they had no choice</i>

<i>but to sell to him, too!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
<i>And that's vertical integration! </i>[burps]

</p>

<p>
[giggles] <i>Pardon me.</i>

<i>F-f-f-f-fast-forward to the 1980s,</i>

<i>when Jeremiah took our company</i>

<i>to the next level.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<p>
[Vert]<i> He bought a telephone company,</i>

<i>a sports team, and when he didn't like</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<p>
<i>-he bought his own newspaper!</i>

-[Ollie chomps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
<i>Well, I must have been a hungry whale</i>

<i>because I just kept gobbling up companies.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
<i>Fast-forward to today,</i>

<i>and it looks like I gobbled up you!</i>

<p>
-[chuckles]

-Are we supposed to be charmed by this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<p>
<i>Welcome to the Whitewhale family.</i>

<i>Everywhere you are, that's where we'll be.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
Here's a list

of your new sister companies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<p>
Please be mindful of them

as you spew your content. [sputters]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
So we can't make videos

about any of these subsidiaries?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
Monsanto, JP Morgan Chase,

Marie Osmond?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<p>
Oh! There it is,

the Every Animal Girl Company.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
You don't really think Whitewhale bought

Girl Croosh just to kill our video?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
And you couldn't just tell

a feel-good story about two friends

who started a business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
Maybe this is for the best.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
You can get a new job in Chicago,

spend more time with your kid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
Yeah, and you can go back to LA,

where you won't have to borrow my coat

all the time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<p>
-[giggles]

-Didn't you wanna write another book?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<p>
I have this book of essays

I've been brewing in my head.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
It's called, <i>One Last Thing</i>

<i>and Then I Swear to God I'll Shut Up</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
<i>About This Forever: Dispatches</i>

<i>from the Frontlines of the War on Women:</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<p>
<i>Arguments, Opinions, Reflections,</i>

<i>Recollections, The Razor Tax--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<p>
Is this still the title?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<p>
I kind of got lost in the middle

 and couldn't find a way out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
No, no, it's good,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
I just think you want to save some of it

for the inside of the book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
[sighs] I guess that's it for us,

though, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<p>
-I guess so. Unless it isn't it for us?

-What do you mean?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<p>
What if we did one more video

about anything we wanted

and posted it on the website before they 

realize we still have all the passwords?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<p>
-We could do a story about Whitewhale.

-Oh, yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<p>
Now, there's a feel-good story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
Me feeling good about takin'

those assholes down!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<p>
Diane, this is Isabel,

star reporter at <i>The Tribune.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<p>
She's been hunting Whitewhale for years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<p>
-Call me... Isabel.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
All my days, the beast has haunted me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
The hunt consumes my every waking moment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
You might even say Whitewhale is my...

green light at the end of the dock.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<p>
-What?

-That's a <i>Gatsby</i> reference. Read a book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<p>
Isabel, be nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<p>
I wish I had the energy,

but my obsession has ruined me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<p>
Destroyed my relationships,

obliterated my career. And for nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<p>
I had one contact on the warehouse floor,

Matt Minnowman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
-Hmm.

-Then he disappeared.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<p>
-Maybe there's your story.

-Not your story?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<p>
Mm. My editor thought I was getting

"too invested" in the Whitewhale beat,

so he moved me

to the Holiday Gift Guide desk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<p>
Now the search for the season's hot toy

torments my waking days.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<p>
Are spirographs the new fidget spinners?

The answer eludes me at every turn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<p>
[Diane] I can't believe it. We got a lead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<p>
Hey, do you wanna walk back to my place?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<p>
Are you kidding? It's so cold.

How is it snowing in October?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<p>
There are basically two seasons here:

bitter winter, unbearable humidity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<p>
-You'll learn to love it.

-[giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<p>
-[Diane gasping]

-[both giggling]

<p>
<i>how this Beverly</i>

<i>secret admirer situation is going,</i>

<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<p>
<i>-so I'll cut right to the chase.</i>

-[Guy] Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
<i>I started writing "BH" on my snack kits</i>

<i>to clear up any confusion</i>

<p>
<i>about who the extra nuts are for.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<p>
<i>But now Beverly thinks "BH"</i>

<i>stands for Beverly, here-ya-go.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
<i>"Beverly here ya go"?</i>

<i>Why would the "H" stand for--</i>

</p>

<p>
-[Guy and Diane moan]

<i>-You know what? Doesn't matter.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<p>
<i>The dumbest part is that Beverly doesn't</i>

<i>even eat candied nuts.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
-[Diane moaning]

<i>-She's allergic.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<p>
<i>So she usually just ends up</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<p>
<i>-giving her nuts to me.</i>

-[Guy snores]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<p>
<i>Doctor Champ would probably say</i>

<i>that means something.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<p>
<i>That the universe has a way of looking out</i>

<i>for us if we just stop fighting it, but...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
<i>I don't know.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
<i>Anyway, I guess it's working.</i>

<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<p>
[keyboard clacking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<p>
Were you up all night?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
I was following up on this Matt Minnowman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
Turns out there was an "accident"

at the warehouse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<p>
-What?

-He stayed late to finish some work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
"Look at me, I'm just doing some work.

It's no big deal."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
Next morning, they found him dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<p>
Oh, shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
This guy was trying to get the word out

about working conditions,

and then he died in the warehouse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<p>
I got the names of some coworkers,

let's get our hands

on the security footage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<p>
Did you know your cereal

was made by Whitewhale?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<p>
I threw it out to be safe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<p>
Microchips-- Oh, my God,

you're looking at me like I'm crazy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<p>
You think I'm obsessed.

Am I totally scaring you off right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
No. You're glowing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<p>
Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<p>
[keyboard clacking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<p>
We were working 17-hour days.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
We were spread thinner

than a shitty New York slice of pizza

and working harder than the '96 Bulls.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
[Guy] Okay, so Matt's stationed here...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<p>
So, what, he walked to the other side

of the room just to die?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
That's where he died, all right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
Management left his body out there

on the floor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
Almost like it was a warning

to the other workers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
Wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
I just don't think you can attribute it

to intentional cruelty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
-It's callousness.

-Can't it be both?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<p>
Whitewhale's not evil.

They're just capitalists.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<p>
What's the difference?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<p>
<i>From</i> New York Times,

<i>I'm Michael Barbaro. Today--</i>

-Mister Whitewhale would like to meet you

<p>
Bring your camera. [sputters]

Oh, shit. If they know what we're doing,

why would they wanna talk to us?

<p>
I guess we'll find out.

<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<p>
I'm kind of weirdly excited.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:07" />

<p>
-Hey. I got you something.

-What? Shut up!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<p>
-Huh.

-Ah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<p>
-You don't like it.

-No, I love it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
It's just I won't get much use

out of a coat like this in LA.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
No. It's for here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
Is this your way of asking me

to move to Chicago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>
[chuckles] No. Not everything is some kind

of secret underhanded conspiracy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<p>
-Sometimes a coat's just a coat.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<p>
But I also don't know why it's so obvious

that you go back to LA.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<p>
-I live there.

-But there's nothing for you there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<p>
Excuse me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<p>
I just don't understand

why you're so into punishing yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
I am not--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<p>
And it's not just yourself,

because every time you get cold,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
-guess who has to give you his coat.

-Oh, sorry, does that inconvenience you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<p>
No. [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<p>
I just don't know

why I should suffer

because you have this ideological

objection to feeling good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<p>
Are you-- I would love to feel good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
What a luxury. How nice for you

that you can do that

while the world burns around you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
This is not even about the world,

this is about you and me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
"You and me"?

What's "you and me"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
-Don't--

-No, no, tell me, Guy, please,

because I would love some clarification.

Am I your girlfriend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<p>
Am I the, um,

"you know, woman that I work with"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<p>
-Come on, Diane.

-What is this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<p>
I... Just take the coat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
I think I should go back to the hotel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
[Diane shudders]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<p>
[birds chirping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
I didn't know if you'd come.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
Well, we got a job to do, right?

Could get chilly up there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
I don't know what kind of video

you're putting together,

but I wanted to let you know I don't mind.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
You're not gonna stop us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<p>
I don't want to stop you,

I just said that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<p>
See, when you put out stories about us

being "evil" or "callous"

or whoever the bad guy in <i>Harry Potter</i> is,

people think our business is uncompromised

by morality and our stock goes up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
So, it doesn't bother your shareholders

that one of your employees died

in a work-related accident?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<p>
-What accident?

-Matt Minnowman's body was found

in your warehouse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<p>
Oh, him, sure!

But that was no accident. I killed him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<p>
-What?

-I murdered him!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
Like <i>murdered</i> murdered him?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<p>
Well, I didn't murder-of-crows him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<p>
He took too many bathroom breaks

and encouraged the other employees

to take bathroom breaks as well.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
And you're not worried it's going

to get out that you killed an employee?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
Like in the video

we're shooting right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
Didn't you hear? Congress just passed

a bill legalizing murder if you're rich.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
-No, they didn't-- Oh, my God, they did!

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
Hold on. Just because it passed

the House doesn't mean the Senate will--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<p>
Really, Diane?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
Okay, but the president could still veto--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
Really, Diane?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<p>
All right, sure, but the Supreme Court.

Okay, I get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
Look, don't take it so hard.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
If you wanna do something about it,

just make a billion dollars and murder me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<p>
[both cackle]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
Barbara, let's make sure they get

a nice Whitewhale Company gift bag

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
-on their way out.

-[sputters]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
Well, we can still post the video.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
Yeah, right, well, um, safe travels.

It's been real.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
Yeah. It's been real.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
I'm not gonna beg you to stay

if that's what you're waiting for.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
I'm not waiting for anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<p>
I'm not that guy who says, "Diane,

please don't go, I'm in love with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
Stay here in Chicago

and write your book of essays

and come with me to baseball games.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<p>
They've got a pretty good theater scene

here and a big shiny bean and you could...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<p>
You could be so happy

in your warm winter coat."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<p>
-I don't need you to say--

-I'm not gonna be that guy, all right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<p>
But if you wanted to stay, I could

make things so good for you, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
-Listen--

-No, no, I get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<p>
No, listen. Guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<p>
I feel so shitty all the time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
I feel like the whole world is pushing in

on me, except for when I'm with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<p>
You have been such a good thing for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
But I can't be with you

if you're the only good thing in my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
It's too much pressure. I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
-Diane! Don't get on that train!

-[scoffs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
-Guy, I just told you--

-I know, but you're going to the airport.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<p>
That train's going to Cottage Grove,

you're gonna get screwed!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
Oh, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<p>
{\an8}[BoJack's voice] <i>Dear Diane,</i>

<i>it was Beverly's last day yesterday.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Everyone is real excited for her,</i>

<i>but she spent the whole day sulking</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
<i>because she never found out</i>

<i>who her secret admirer was.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<p>
<i>Frankly, it was getting pretty annoying,</i>

<i>so finally I just say,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
<i>"It was me! I'm in love with you!"</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<p>
<i>And she goes,</i>

<i>"Oh. I was hoping it was Mario."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<p>
<i>And then she starts crying.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
<i>And everyone looks at me like, "Way to go,</i>

<i>you made Beverly cry on her last day."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<p>
<i>So, the thing I keep thinking about is...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<p>
<i>was it worth it for Beverly to be happy</i>

<i>for a little bit,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<p>
<i>even though it ended up sad?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
<i>Or would it have been better</i>

<i>if the whole thing never happened?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<p>
<i>Every time someone leaves rehab...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
<i>it makes you think</i>

<i>about your own progress.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<p>
<i>Some days it feels like you're not</i>

<i>progressing at all, other days you think,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
<i>"Well, maybe a little."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
<i>The main thing I think about</i>

<i>is how stupid I am</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<p>
<i>that I didn't do this sooner.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<p>
<i>I wasted so many years being miserable</i>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
-[phone beeps]

-[line ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
-Hey.

-Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
I was thinking about these grilled cheese

sandwiches I used to make,

back when I first moved to LA.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
-What?

-I was dirt-broke,

and I had no friends and no job,

and I got obsessed with perfecting

the art of the grilled cheese sandwich.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<p>
-Makes sense.

-Partly because it was cheap,

but also because while I was doing it,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<p>
I wasn't thinking about how depressing

my life was.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:13" />

<p>
So, on the plane I was thinking,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<p>
I should make

another grilled cheese sandwich

because I haven't in a long time,

but I love them

and they always make me feel better

about things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<p>
-Look, Diane, I gotta--

-And the thing about

making your own grilled cheese sandwich

is you can do it anywhere. You know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<p>
Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:33" />

<p>
Yeah.

So, I guess that's another good thing.
