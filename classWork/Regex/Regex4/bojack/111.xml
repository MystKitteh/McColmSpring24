[BoJack] <i>Okay, how about this one?</i>

</p>

<p>
BoJack swallowed a dozen

pastries in the time it took

the caterer

to unwrap a fruit tray.

<p>
When she asked where

the pastries had gone,

<p>
BoJack claimed he had no idea,

spraying her with

bits of buttery crust?

</p>

to the flawed portrait

I painted of you.

<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<p>
No, because he was flawed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
BoJack, when people find

out that someone like you,

who seems larger than life,

is actually just as wounded

and vulnerable as they are,

it makes them feel less lonely.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
Ugh, no!

Maybe that's what flawed,

sad fatties want

from other celebrities,

but for BoJack Horseman,

they want a heroic horse-stud

who is awesome

and who can save them from

their flawed, sad, fatty lives.

</p>

<p>
- You're so wrong.

Now that I think about it,

I think that you're so wrong!

<p>
Listen, we all agree

Diane broke contract

by leaking

the first two chapters,

but the response

has been amazing!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<p>
People want to read more,

and we have to

get this to the printers

by the end of the week,

because that's when

the repo men are coming

to take away our printers.

<p>
The end of the week?

No!

<p>
Okay, what if I told you

that I could have

a new book for you by then?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<p>
- What?

- Yeah, a better one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<p>
Better stories,

better told, by me--

straight from the horse's mouth.

<p>
You're gonna write

a whole book in five days?

as you did with me.

how you married Mr. Peanutbutter

because he's too dumb to see how

It's pathetic!

I'm sorry no one wanted

to date you

in high school, Diane,

but I don't see why I have

to suffer just because

you were never especially

pretty or interesting.

So, you really think you could

write a better book by Friday?

<p>
Damn right I can, so you

can throw this turd of a book

in the garbage and then

light the garbage on fire.

Yeah, yeah.

Oh, my God, this is so good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<p>
It's good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
- So good, so good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
Okay, Todd, how is it going

with the heartwarming anecdotes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<p>
Great! I'm writing

about that time

we officially became

best friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<p>
Nice! Can you change

best to pretty good?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
Sarah Lynn, how's it coming with

the <i>Horsin' Around</i> years?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<p>
Almost done with the story

where Hulk Hogan guest starred

and told us to say no to drugs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
Great.

Keep typing, monkeys.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
If only Hulk Hogan

could see us now, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
Because Sarah Lynn said

the thing about Hulk Hogan?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
That was like four hours ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
Oh, uh, right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
- How we doing now?

- Sending.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<p>
- Just about to send.

- Nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
Okay, this is great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<p>
That puts us at 216 pages?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<p>
Holy shit, that's almost as long

as <i>The Firm</i> by John Grisham.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
And we just needed

to get to 200, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
I'm just gonna keep writing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<p>
I got a lot of synapses

firing right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
It's surprisingly literate

and insightful, but still fun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<p>
It's a beach read you can

thumb through in a wing chair.

</p>

Can't believe Diane

thought this was so hard.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<p>
"Ow, my fingers are cramping

from all this typing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<p>
It's like they're

having their period."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
Did Diane really say that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
No, but my fingers

are cramping.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<p>

</p>

[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
Good one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
We just need a way

to end this thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
What should the ending be?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<p>
Maybe it was Earth all along.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<p>
Not that,

but something like that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
Keep thinking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<p>
[whinnies]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

Did you guys switch clothes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<p>
I like your idea better,

BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<p>
- What?

- Your idea for the ending.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
- Oh, what'd I say?

- About Maine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
About how you end up in Maine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
I like the part where you swim

in the lake in the summers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
Yeah, right, and when I get

too old to take care of myself,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
I go for one last swim.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>

<i>back to shore.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>

<i>take me under.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
Eesh! Downer ending.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<p>
- You got something better?

- Wait a minute.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
Maybe we don't know

the ending yet

because you haven't lived it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
Yeah, I mean,

if you want to, like, finish

finish the book, then you'd

have to, like, die tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<p>
Oh, I know!

I should murder you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

</p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<p>
Think about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<p>
If the little girl

you raised on television

killed you in real life--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
[gasps]

people would eat that shit up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
I love it. It's perfect.

We'll sell so many books.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<p>
Oh, yeah.

Yeah, kill BoJack!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

- Oh, yes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

Oh, yeah, gonna get you!

</p>

<p>
[all yelling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
Okay, so what did we learn?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
We learned that if

we're going to do drugs

we should do them at home where

it's safe to do them together,

right, Todd?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<p>
- No!

- Ahh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<p>
Don't worry, guys.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<p>
I have this gun to keep

us safe from intruders.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<p>
- And each other.

- Wait, wait, wait.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
Is that just

your gun-shaped lighter,

or your lighter-shaped gun?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
Busted!

It's just a lighter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
- [gunshot]

- [all] Aah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
Shit, I guess it's my gun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<p>
Then what'd I do

with my lighter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
And what did I give

to that baby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
Ha, I have a gun, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<p>
Don't be a Silly Billy.

That's a broom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<p>
Wait, am I holding a gun?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<p>
Todd, are you holding

a gun or a broom?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<p>
I can't tell anymore!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
I guess we'll just have

to shoot them at each other

at the same time to find out!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<p>
Okay!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<p>
Todd, sh-- Oh-- Can I just say--

Todd, Todd, I need you--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
I need you to shh.

Listen, listen, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
Okay, just to be totally clear,

we're shooting each other

to determine whether we're

holding guns or brooms, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
Not because you're still mad

about the whole

me sabotaging you

with the rock opera

and your live stream

and suchety-such?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<p>

<p>
Quiet, quiet,

quiet, quiet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
As you know, I was hurt,

but then I realized

that's just how you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
You know, and maybe I just

need to stop expecting you

to be a good person,

so that way, I won't

get hurt when you're not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
Oh, o-- Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
Hey, this isn't fair.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<p>
I don't have a gun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<p>
Sarah Lynn is right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
You know, if we all had guns,

then no one would need a gun,

and we would all be safe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
Oh, my God.

</p>

Now, you want your mommy

to love you?

<p>
You go out there and you do

the only thing you're good for,

which is singing

the goddamn <i>Lollipop</i> song.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<p>
And let me tell you somethin'.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<p>
The secret to living

<p>
[Diane] Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
What seems to be the problem?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
Good grief.

I'm so depressed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
I just want everyone

to love me,

but I don't know

how to make them do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<p>
{\an8}You can't force love,

you blockhead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<p>
{\an8}All you can do is be good

to the people in your life,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<p>
{\an8}and keep your heart open.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
I screwed it all up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<p>
It's too late for me, isn't it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<p>
I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
I'm just a crazy

drug hallucination.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
I'll say whatever

you want me to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<p>
Then tell me

it's not too late.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
Well, it's not too late.

It's never too late.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
- Yeah, that's right.

- It's never too late

to be the person

you want to be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<p>
You need to choose

the life you want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<p>
Ran into Ed

at the hardware store.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
He said we're

in for some weather.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<p>
What the hell does that mean?

"Some weather."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
We're always

in for some weather.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<p>
Guess what, Ed?

There's never not weather.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<p>
[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
Oh, BoJack, don't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
Come on,

I can't help it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
It's just so cute

how they do it automatically.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
How do they know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
Oh, man, can we just stay

exactly like this

for the rest of our lives,

please?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<p>
Yeah, okay, sure, uh, or we

could do the opposite of that,

because I'm pregnant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<p>
What?

That's amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<p>
Yeah, and I'm 80% sure

it's yours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
Is it weird that I want

to make love to you right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
Why would that be weird?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<p>
I don't know, it's--

I don't want to spook the baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<p>
Maybe we should just

do mouth and hand stuff

for the next nine months.

Hello?

BoJack, I read the pages

you sent me last night,

and I have to tell you,

your book is absolutely,

without a doubt, the most...

gibberish.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
<i>- It's gibberish.</i>

- What day is it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<p>
Let's see what you got here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<p>
You got 20 pages of

<i>Doctor Who</i> erotic fan fiction,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
<i>a recipe for soup,</i>

<i>five different theories</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<i>about how 9/11 happened,</i>

and a bunch

of embedded YouTube videos

that can't possibly

be printed in book form.

Any questions, at all,

<p>
Um, yeah, I have a question

for Tori Spelling.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
Again, Tori Spelling is not

here, as I already explained.

</p>

Tori Spelling's

ghostwriter is here.

<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<p>
Uh, yeah,

this is for the whole panel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<p>
What's your favorite kind

of ghost to write for?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
What?

No, they don't write for ghosts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
That's not wha-- Why did I think

this would be a good idea?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<p>
Does anyone have

an actual question

for someone on this panel?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<p>
An actual question, or a gun,

so I can shoot myself?

My question is for Diane.

</p>

<p>
Look, I'm sorry about all the

stuff I said about you earlier.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
We can publish

the book you wrote.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<p>
You're obviously a better

writer than I am,

and I don't actually

even really care

what the world thinks

about me anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<p>
I just hated reading that book

because I hated feeling like

that's how you saw me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
Because I guess you know me

better than anybody,

and if you think that--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<p>
Um, I guess my question is, do you--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<p>
Do you think

it's too late for me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
I mean, am I just doomed

to be the person that I am?

<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
The-- The person in that book?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
It's not too late for me, is it?

It's-- It's not too late--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<p>
Diane, I need you to tell me

that it's not too late.

</p>

<p>
- BoJack, I--

- I-- I need you to tell me

that I'm a good person.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<p>
I know that I can be selfish

and narcissistic

and self-destructive,

but underneath all that,

deep down, I'm a good person,

and I need you to tell me

that I'm good, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
Tell me, please, Diane.

Tell me that I'm good.
