<line>
Whoo! Come on, Baby Humans!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<line>
Oh, oh. You gotta try

a Chicago-style baked potato.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<line>
Why does everything

have to be "Chicago-style" here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<line>
We get it. We're in Chicago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
-Come on. Just try it.

-[scoffs] Look at this.

<line>
-Oops.

-Yeah. "Oops."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
Or the Chicago Baby Humans are owned

by the brother of the CEO of Plastico.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<line>
And we are thereby complicit

in this incestuous money-laundering

scheme that's, oh,

by the way, killing the planet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<line>
[scoffs] But what are you gonna do, right?

-Good morning, beautiful.

-Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<line>
Wanna go try and hit

a Chicago-style museum?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<line>
Oh, I'd love to, but I really have

to work on my book. Next time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:43" />

<line>
Great! I've made my romantic offer.

I've officially been a good boyfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:46" />

<line>
I will now retreat to our living room

to play video games all day.

<line>
Hello. I am Diane,

and I am a young girl living in Boston

and ever since I was that,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<line>
I wanted to write good things

that were good,

this is not good, fix this later.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<line>
[grunting] Diane, as your father,

I am very unsupportive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<line>
Come up with examples

of Dad being unsupportive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<line>
Okay, yes.

And, also, the girls from high school.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<line>
Hey, I'm Krissy Keating.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<line>
{\an8}Can you use my real name?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<line>
{\an8}Check if it's okay to use my real name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<line>
Anyway, I was a real bitch to you,

but now maybe you're realizing

I was bullied, too?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<line>
{\an8}-Is any of this interesting?

-[BoJack]<i> Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<line>
Put me in your book.

Remember I gave you that salad bowl?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<line>
{\an8}And I broke the bowl!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<line>
Answer your phone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<line>
And I glued it back together with gold

because I read an article

about the Japanese art of kintsugi!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<line>
{\an8}-And it fell apart again.

-It kept falling apart like our marriage!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<line>
[Mr. Peanutbutter] Is that something?

Is any of this anything?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<line>
{\an8}[BoJack] <i>Diane. Answer your phone.</i>

<i>I'm calling you right now.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<line>
{\an8}[phone beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<line>
{\an8}-Hello?

-[BoJack]<i> Hey, Diane.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<line>
If I had my shitty students

do a night of scenes here

at the end of the semester,

would you come see it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
It's gonna suck, so I wanna pack the house

with friendly faces.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
When you sell it like that,

how can I resist?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<line>
<i>How's that book coming?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<line>
-I'm actually at the mall, writing it now.

-Why are you writing at the mall?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<line>
{\an8}I couldn't focus at home

and this is the only place

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
{\an8}I could sit and work for ten hours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
{\an8}I can get lunch here, I can people-watch,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
{\an8}all without having to endure

what the Chicagoans refer to as "spring."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<line>
{\an8}Hey, Chicago, 49 degrees is not spring.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<line>
{\an8}-It's the non-Lachey half of a boy band.

<i>-What?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<line>
{\an8}Forty-nine! Half of 98?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<line>
{\an8}Diane, don't workshop your material

in casual conversation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<line>
{\an8}Howie Mandel used to do it, too.

Like, really, Howie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<line>
{\an8}You just happened to have a rubber glove

in your pocket?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
All I need to do now

is actually write my book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<line>
I have so many stories to tell,

but I can't seem to figure out

what the book is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<line>
You gonna put any stories

about me in there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<line>
{\an8}-I think I've written about you enough.

<i>-But no one else is as good at it!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm sure someone will rise

to the occasion.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
Baxter, darling, I've just a moment

to update you on the progress

of our Penny Carson crusade.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
{\an8}So far, we've been able to contact three

of the four Penny Carsons

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<line>
{\an8}listed in New Mexico.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<line>
{\an8}Baxter, there's nowhere I'd rather be

than on our honeymoon cruise to "Unjuga,"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<line>
{\an8}but I simply can't stop now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
We're on the lookout for the fourth Penny,

and, God willing, she'll be the lucky one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<line>
Oh! Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
-Caw-caw! Caw-caw!

-[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<line>
Oh... [stammers]

Sorry, I didn't mean you. Paige!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<line>
Kisses, Baxter dear,

it appears we've found our deer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<line>
Okay. Book, here we go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
I grow up in Boston town

because my father,

who I never was close with,

live in Boston.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
That's not right English,

I'll fix it later.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<line>
Me from Boston.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<line>
Well, you're not from Boston, but yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
-Whatever for now.

-Beantown.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<line>
To really understand

what it's like to grow up in Boston,

you actually have to go back 250 years

to the Boston Tea Party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
Taxation without representation

is wicked unjust, bro!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<line>
Bro, check it out.

I'm teabaggin' the harbor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<line>
Oh, no freakin' way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
-[laughs]

-[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<line>
-Go, Pats. Unrelated.

-[Diane] Stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
-I'm getting distracted.

-Why can't you stay focused?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
What's wrong with your head, Deedee?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
{\an8}The idea behind

the Japanese art of kintsugi

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
{\an8}is that cracks in an object

are part of its history.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
{\an8}-What does that have to do with anything?

-We have to look at trauma!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<line>
Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<line>
[woman] We totally have to look at Trauma.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<line>
-What?

-There's a spring sale.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
Forty percent off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<line>
Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<line>
[grunting, groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<line>
[Ivy] Did you hear

security still can't figure out

who's stealing wallets? Like... [scoffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
I bet my life it's that hag Devon

from the hair crimper cart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<line>
Oh, my God, yes,

that theory is beast, Ivy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<line>
-Excuse me, I'm sorry...

-We forgive you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<line>
You know the story about Gemberly, right?

What they found in her locker?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<line>
-Tell me.

-It was a--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<line>
I meant "Pardon me, I need another size."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<line>
But I can't seem to find

a number on the tag?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<line>
-We don't see size here at Trauma.

-Okay, but can you help me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
Sure. I think it would help

if you figured out

why you need to put a number on your body,

and let me get back to this mystery.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<line>
Thanks.

-[phone buzzing, beeps]

-Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
[Ivy] Oh, my God,

she's like taking a phone call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<line>
Diane! Great news!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<line>
"Birthday Dad" premiered last night

to a 0.006,

which is the biggest network hit

since the inventor

of blood-scented perfume

went on <i>Shark Tank</i>

and got her arm bitten off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<line>
Great!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<line>
Meanwhile, my company's running

like gangbusters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
Is gangbusters a slur of some sort?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<line>
-Can we still say gangbusters?

-I'll look into it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
And with Todd watching the baby,

my work-life balance is on point.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
-Did you call me just to brag?

<i>-I was thinking...</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<line>
What would make my work-life balance

even on pointier?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<line>
And it hit me: more work!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<line>
So, I thought I'd check in

and see how your book's doing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<line>
Oh. I'm still kind of figuring out

what the "is" of it is, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
-It's been six months.

-Okay, I think it's about...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<line>
-Trauma.

<i>-Trauma?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<line>
Or... damage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
You know, those bowls that break

and then the cracks get filled with gold

and then they're even more beautiful?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<line>
Maybe it's like that, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<line>
Like, we've all been damaged,

but it's good damage

because it makes us more who we are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<line>
Is that anything?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<line>
Yeah, good damage. I like it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<line>
Send me the pages

and we'll get 'em to the publisher.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<line>
Okay, but no hurry?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<line>
Okay, but, no. Hurry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<line>
What can I get ya?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<line>
Some information

with a side order of revelation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<line>
Is that a type of pasta?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
Oh, also a water. I am parched.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<line>
In fact, why don't you freeze

that water into a cube shape

and drop it in some bourbon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<line>
We're looking to identify

an associate of Sarah Lynn's.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
Sarah Lynn? Is this about BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<line>
Is it about BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<line>
I don't know what you're looking for,

but I don't know anything about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<line>
Okay? I haven't seen BoJack in years.

Or Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<line>
But you have seen them?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<line>
I'm gonna go ask the kitchen

about your pasta.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<line>
BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
Wait, that's the fellow

from the police report,

who found the dead girl

in the planetarium.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<line>
-Yes?

-<i>Found</i> the dead girl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<line>
-Are you smelling what I'm smelling?

-[snorts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<line>
If he was also with her

at the AA meeting...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
Well, then why wouldn't he mention it

to the police? What's he hiding?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<line>
You're starting to make more sense

than a change machine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
Yeah, speaking of cents,

what happened to Penny?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<line>
-Oh, poop! Our scoop's flown the coop!

-Go, go, go! Gotta stay in the loop!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<line>
"So in a way, that salad bowl was me,

and the cracks... were also me..."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<line>
-Ugh! It sucks, I'm sorry.

-It's a first draft.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<line>
I can't remember what happened when

and I keep getting distracted.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<line>
It's because of the meds.

This is what I was afraid would happen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<line>
But isn't it worth it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<line>
You've been feeling

so much better, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<line>
I do feel lighter, and clearer,

but also so foggy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<line>
You feel clear and foggy?

How is that even possible?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<line>
-I don't know! Because of the fog.

-Hey. Stick with it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
-With the writing? Or the fog?

-Both.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
{\an8}Okay. So, start at the beginning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm a baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
{\an8}[Todd] Hey, baby!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<line>
Isn't it great to grow up in a comfortable

upper-middle class home,

surrounded by love?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
{\an8}But I didn't grow up surrounded by love.

That's the problem.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<line>
You were fine!

Name one example of me being a bad dad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<line>
Uh, okay! What about how you made me lose

on purpose at Boggle

</line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<line>
-That's all you got?

-I got other things!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<line>
There was lots of shit. Constantly!

I just can't express--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<line>
Is this what your book is?

Just you complaining?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<line>
As your target audience,

I'm not hooked yet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<line>
You are not my target audience.

[Ivy] This book is like bore me

with a spoon, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<line>
You know the story about Gemberly, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<line>
-What they found in her locker?

-Tell me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
It was a note from the thief,

saying where all the wallets were hidden.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<line>
What? What is this? I'm trying to write

about my childhood trauma.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<line>
-Who are you?

-I'm Ivy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<line>
My mom and I just moved to Chicago

from Southern California.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<line>
[Diane] <i>What? No. I can't...</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
My dad died and we needed a new start.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<line>
I don't really get Chicago yet,

and the winters are cold AF,

so I hang out at the mall a lot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
Malls are fun!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<line>
Or "beast," which is slang

that young people like me say.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<line>
-You're Ivy Tran, right?

-Ivy T. That's me!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<line>
I-I need help.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
Someone's been filching onesies

by the twosies

from the fourth floor Baby Hole,

and if I don't figure out whodunnit,

my manager's gonna mount my head

on the wall!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<line>
Yes, managers can be very annoying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
I'll take the case.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<line>
-Oh, and, also, I'm Vietnamese-American.

-[moose] Beast.

"Ivy Tran, Food Court Detective"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
Well, I like this. It's fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
My book is supposed

to be a profound treatise on damage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
But I can't even access my damage.

I'm too...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<line>
-hopped up on goof-berries!

-What the hell is a goof-berry?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<line>
I need to go to a dark place,

and I can't get there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
When I'm with you, when we're out,

I feel good, I feel happy,

but the minute I sit down to write--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<line>
 You were having trouble writing

this book when you were depressed,

and you're having trouble

now that you're not depressed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<line>
Is it possible that you just--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<line>
-What? That I'm just a shitty writer?

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
That you just don't wanna write this book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<line>
I do, though. It's just hard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<line>
But that means it's worthwhile.

Good things are hard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<line>
I'm not writing

<i>The Mall-related Mysteries of Ivy Tran!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<line>
-[chuckles] Why not?

-Guy, come on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<line>
-No. You come on.

-You come on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<line>
Diane, I'm gonna tell you

what I always tell my good friend Eileen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
-Don't do it.

-Eileen, come on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<line>
[scoffs, chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<line>
More drugs, please!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<line>
-[phone buzzes, beeps]

-Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
I soft-pitched your book

to Brad Pitt's company, Plan B,

and Craig Bierko's company, Plan C.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<line>
They're very excited

about the movie adaptation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
What movie adaptation?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<line>
Gee, I don't know,

a new Robin Hood adaptation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<line>
No, Diane, the adaptation of your book!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
What book?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>
Come to think of it, a new Robin Hood

sounds pretty good. Judah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<line>
-Maybe from Maid Marian's point of view?

-Directed by Sofia Coppola?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<line>
I'll try Rebecca Ferguson's agent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
[Diane] <i>You're still on the phone with me!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<line>
Oh, right. The town has really responded

to your pitch about damage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<line>
It wasn't a pitch!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<line>
Imagine, all the little Dianes out there,

just waiting to see their story

on the big screen

during a brief Oscar-qualifying run

in New York and LA.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<line>
You don't think it's too sad, do you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<line>
It wouldn't be better

if I wrote something more fun?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<line>
<i>Diane, sad is the new fun.</i>

<i>Besides, the sad is what makes it you!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
-Really?

<i>-Yes! Everyone's very excited.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<line>
<i>But they wanna see pages.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
So, do what you do and get me that sad!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
Just got back word from Sofia.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<line>
She's booked for the next year

developing a new <i>Peter Pan</i>

from Wendy's point of view,

and Rebecca's doing a limited series

about the female ticket-taker

at the cinema

where Batman's parents got shot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<line>
Ooh, that's really empowering.

Diane, I gotta go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<line>
Uh... Ngu-yen?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
N-Ngu-yen?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<line>
No one?

[Charlotte humming]

<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<line>
-Hey, Mom.

-Hey, Pen!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
-What's wrong?

-Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<line>
A girl can't visit her mom?

Why are you grilling me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<line>
Slow down. Breathe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<line>
Something happened at work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<line>
-Something?

-[both gasp]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<line>
Or someone...s?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<line>
Did you follow me home?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<line>
If you didn't wanna be followed,

you should have been more judicious

with the turn signal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<line>
A lady doesn't need to always announce

where she's headed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<line>
Yes. Who taught you how to drive?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<line>
-Uh, can I help you?

-Paige Sinclair, intrepid gal reporter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<line>
And I'm Max!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<line>
We're circling a story

on the last days of Sarah Lynn

and we're trying to nail down a timeline.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<line>
We think your BoJack Horseman

may have played a part. [snorts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<line>
I think you should go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<line>
Well, it was worth a try.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<line>
Actually, I did see Sarah Lynn.

Right before she died.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<line>
Oh! It was very worth a try.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<line>
She came to Oberlin. With BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<line>
-Whoa! BoJack came to Oberlin?

-And what happened?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<line>
-Nothing. I mean--

-Why didn't you tell me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:32" />

<line>
I saw them and told BoJack to leave.

That's it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<line>
-Were they intoxicated?

-Is BoJack ever not intoxicated?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:38" />

<line>
-Would you go on the record?

-No, she won't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<line>
Excuse us,

we are just about to sit down to dinner.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<line>
Do you think BoJack got Sarah Lynn drunk?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<line>
Do you think BoJack got Sarah Lynn drunk?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
-Penny--

-I'm not a kid, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<line>
-We should tell them about Maddy.

-No--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<line>
Who's Maddy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:53" />

<line>
My best friend in high school.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
BoJack was living here

and he bought her booze

before the prom

and then she got alcohol poisoning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<line>
I'm sorry, he was living here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<line>
-Oh, what's this, a party?

-[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<line>
Did you guys forget to invite Kyle?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<line>
-Dad... [sighs]

-Ah, just kidding. Now it's a party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
Kyle, these folks

are from the refrigerator repair company.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<line>
And I just told them

that our refrigerator is working fine

and they were just leaving.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<line>
Quite. If you think of anything else,

please do give us a call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<line>
Ah. You know, the wine fridge

has actually been acting kind of funky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<line>
Two refrigerators? Ha!

Give my regards to the Rockafellers.

</line>

<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<line>
Can you keep it down, please?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<line>
I couldn't sleep

and you're like shout-whistling at me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<line>
Hey, I'm just whistling. Chicago-style.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<line>
Don't. Just please be quiet.

I need to write.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<line>
Okay. Okay. Write on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<line>
[exhales sharply]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<line>
-Hey, how was the writing?

-What do you mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<line>
You were gonna write today.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
[Diane] Oh, is the day over?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<line>
-I was just thinking my thoughts...

-Are you all right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<line>
-[crying]

-Oh! Oh, my God!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<line>
-Diane, what's wrong?

-I...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<line>
-[retching, coughing]

-Oh, oh, oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<line>
-It's okay. I got it in the plant.

-Oh! Not in the toilet?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<line>
I'm not gonna put my face in your toilet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<line>
-Don't be gross.

-Our toilet, baby. We've been over this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<line>
I had to think fast. Went for the plant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<line>
Okay, but the sink? Or the shower?

There's so many drains in there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<line>
I'm sorry. I gotta work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:20" />

<line>
Hey. [sighs] Maybe you can just go back

to bed and you can work in the morning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<line>
No. Now. Gotta get it done.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<line>
Krissy Keating's a real bitch to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<line>
{\an8}-Was I? Or did you deserve it?

-I deserved it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<line>
Your problem is you always blame

other people, Deedee.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<line>
-I know.

-Who's a good baby? Not you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<line>
Where are my pages, Diane?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<line>
I need pages for my beautiful celebrities,

such as Stockard Channing, Tatum O'Neal,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<line>
Patrick Harrison Ford Focus.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<line>
I'm trying to focus.

I'm trying to get to the truth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<line>
-I think you're afraid of the truth.

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<line>
{\an8}Your damage isn't interesting

and you're unworthy of love.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<line>
-No, I'm not!

-Of course you are!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<line>
Are you, uh, you know,

one of those stupid pop culture analogies

I'm always doing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<line>
Because you're charming at first,

but eventually enough already!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<line>
{\an8}You think you're a beautiful salad bowl?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<line>
{\an8}[scoffs] Conceited much?

</line>

<line>
Diane, what is going on?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<line>
There's a heaviness... on my chest.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<line>
And it's not just my boobs, even though,

yes, my boobs are heavier now.

-I stopped taking my meds.

No. You're not a stupid person,

<line>
I want to die!

</line>

<line>
-It's so much worse than before.

-Baby, you're going through withdrawal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<line>
Do I just have to be on drugs forever now?

How am I gonna finish my book?

-Okay, forget about the book for a second.

-I can't!

-Now, that's not true.

I'm sorry. I'm sorry I'm so stupid.

I'm sorry.

<line>
It's okay. It's okay.

Just take your pills. All right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<line>
Then when you even out we can talk

about trying something else, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
Okay.

-Stop.

-I let the stress get to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

I should just call Princess Carolyn

Yes. But before you do that...

don't be mad.

Don't be mad about what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<line>
If I tell you, will you be mad?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<line>
From the tone of this conversation,

I'm guessing probably.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<line>
Okay, what you have to remember

is that you were in a really dark place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<line>
And the pressure from Princess Carolyn

wasn't helping.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
I thought if I could get her off your back

for a few days...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<line>
What did you do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<line>
[phone buzzing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<line>
Guy, what did you do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<line>
I sent her the <i>Ivy Tran:</i>

<i>Food Court Detective</i> pages.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<line>
-What?

-I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
-I made an executive decision!

-You're not an executive!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<line>
I-I made a boyfriend decision! All right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<line>
I made a "my girlfriend

is a depressed, vomiting mess

and someone needs to make a decision"

decision.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<line>
Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<line>
-Hello? No.

<i>-</i>[Princess Carolyn] <i>Loved it!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<line>
I love the protagonist, I love the world,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<line>
I love that it wasn't your sad memoir

about your boring life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<line>
What happened to "sad is the new fun"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
I didn't know you could write this fun!

You gotta finish this thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<line>
I'm on pins and needles,

and I'm not just saying that

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<line>
-because I live with a porcupine.

-Listen--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<line>
To the ka-ching, ka-ching

of the middle-grade IP market? Done!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<line>
I slipped the pages to a few studios.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<line>
This has franchise potential.

Franch potench.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<line>
But what I'm saying is that it doesn't,

because that's not the book I'm writing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
-I'm hearing a maybe.

-I'm not--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
Are we gonna have

a Boston-style fight now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<line>
[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<line>
[Ivy] <i>Here's a mystery.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
Why are you so sad-core?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<line>
{\an8}-I don't know.

-Just be fun and popular like me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
{\an8}-I don't know how.

-Sure, you do!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<line>
I'm clever and free-spirited

and a little bit sardonic

but not so much that it's off-putting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<line>
I have vulnerabilities like everybody else

but just enough to make me relatable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<line>
-That's the way to be.

-It's not that easy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<line>
Yeah, I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<line>
But wouldn't it be nice if it was?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
-[Ruthie cooing]

-Where's Princess Carolyn?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<line>
She said we should save her a seat.

You still working on that memoir?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<line>
Well, funny story about that--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<line>
Oh, I love when stories start like that!

Ooh! You should put this one in your book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<line>
-Hello. Thank you.

-[cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<line>
Oh, wow. Thank you.

That's very nice. Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<line>
Welcome to "An Evening

of Modern American Scenes."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<line>
Oh, excuse me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
-[sighs]

-We have to talk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<line>
Shh. Diane!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<line>
-Don't be rude to the actors.

-[scoffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<line>
For most of them,

this'll be the height of their career.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<line>
[BoJack] Anyway, first up is a scene

from Sam German-Shepard's "Real America."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<line>
[audience cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<line>
[Kyle laughing]

Char, hey, you gotta get in here!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<line>
This episode of "Birthday Dad"

is an all-timer!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:09" />

<line>
-Penny...

-I wanted to get something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<line>
[grunting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<line>
[sighs] I don't feel good about

what happened with those reporters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<line>
-It's okay.

-We didn't tell them... everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<line>
I tried to throw it out, but I couldn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<line>
I know that's messed up,

but I think I look nice here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<line>
Oh! You look beautiful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<line>
I don't think that's the only reason

I kept the photo, Mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<line>
It's all really confusing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<line>
[Kyle] Charlotte! Birthday Dad

just got trapped in a leap year!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<line>
-How's he gonna wriggle outta this one?

-In a minute, honey!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<line>
Stuff happened to us, okay?

And he's still out there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<line>
-Penny--

-If we can get the word out,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
-if-if people knew--

-It won't be just him in the story.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
It'll be you and me. The mistakes we made.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
Mistakes I made,

that I will never forgive myself for.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<line>
But if we can help other people,

then it will have been for something,

you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<line>
It won't just be this thing

to feel bad about forever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
You don't know what's gonna happen

with the story once it's out there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<line>
You have no power over it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<line>
And you just got your panic attacks

under control.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<line>
Yeah, I know, but--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<line>
I love that you want to do what's right,

but please just think about it, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
Just give it a couple days

and then if you still want to talk

to them, you can call them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<line>
Okay. Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<line>
You wanna stay and watch "Birthday Dad"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<line>
-Stay the night?

-No, I-I should go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<line>
Okay. Yeah. I love you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
I love you, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<line>
[Kyle] Oh! Is that the International

Date Line?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
Don't go over the date line, Birthday Dad!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<line>
Because then it won't be your birthday

anymore! [laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<line>
[cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<line>
Thank you. Thank you so much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<line>
Come on, Todd, let's go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
But I wanna see

if there's an after-credits scene.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<line>
-[Princess Carolyn] Talk soon, Diane.

-Hey, wait a minute.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<line>
-[door opens, closes]

-Princess Carolyn. [grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn, wait.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<line>
I understand you're trying to be helpful,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<line>
-in your own pushy, self-absorbed way.

-Oh, thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<line>
But I don't wanna write

a middle-grade fiction detective series.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
I think you do, though.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<line>
Because when I was reading it,

I could tell you were having fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<line>
Yeah, but I'm not writing a book

to have fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<line>
If I don't write my book of essays now,

I never will!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />

<line>
So? Don't write your book of essays.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<line>
-I have to!

-Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />

<line>
Because if I don't,

that means that all the damage I got

isn't good damage, it's just damage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<line>
I have gotten nothing out of it,

and all those years

I was miserable was for nothing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<line>
I could have been happy this whole time

and written books about girl detectives

and been cheerful and popular

and had good parents,

is that what you're saying?

What was it all for?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<line>
I...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<line>
I don't know, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<line>
All I know is that this book

about the girl detective is fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<line>
I liked it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<line>
I like thinking that my daughter

could grow up in a world

with books like that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:11" />

<line>
Or if my daughter's not a reader,

a lucrative film adaptation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<line>
When I was a little girl,

I thought that everything,

all the abuse and neglect,

it somehow made me special,

and I decided that one day

I would write something

that would make little girls like me

feel less alone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:27" />

<line>
And if I can't write that book...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:30" />

<line>
Then...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<line>
Then maybe write this other book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:35" />

<line>
-Maybe this book does that, too.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:42" />

<line>
-[Ruthie giggles]

-[toy squeaks]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:45" />

<line>
-Uh... Princess Carolyn?

-What reporters?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:48" />

<line>
BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:49" />

<line>
Charlotte, I swear,

I don't know what you're talking about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:52" />
