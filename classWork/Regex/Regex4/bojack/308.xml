When you two first came into my office,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<line>
I was like,

"This marriage is not going to last."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
But you've really put the work in.

I deem your marriage fixed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
Thanks, Dr. Janet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<line>
We couldn't have done this without you

and your many novelty certificates.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<line>
Well, this has certainly been a big year

for the Rabitowitz marriage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<line>
It certainly has.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<line>
But now it's New Year's Eve and, Katie,

my New Year's resolution to you

is to spend more time

with my wonderful wife, who I--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<line>
- [cell phone rings]

- I gotta take this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<line>
-Oh, um, but--

-Hello.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<line>
Hey, partner, big news. Huge news.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<line>
I'm all ears.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<line>
<i>The Flight of the Pegasus</i>

just lost their lead.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<line>
They start shooting next week.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<line>
So what you're telling me is David Pincher

needs a new star immediately

for his three-picture young adult

dystopian future franchise?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<line>
Yup. What's that I hear?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<line>
Beep beep.

Someone's calling on the other line.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
That's strange. Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<line>
It's Oodles of Money calling.

Will we accept the charges?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<line>
Why would Oodles of Money

be calling collect?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
I don't know. Don't accept the charges,

we cannot afford it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
I gotta go in. I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<line>
Okay. But make sure

you're back before, you know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<line>
Deal. Best deal I ever made.

[kisses]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<line>
Boom!

What's black and white and sexy all over?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<line>
Chuff Hollister.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>
He's young, he's hot,

he's Australian or British or whatever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<line>
We can paint over his stripes

so he looks like a horse.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<line>
I can see the headline now:

Chuff Hollister is...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<line>
The next Pegasus.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<line>
BoJack's got star power and grit

up the wazoo. I can't imagine...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<line>
Anyone who would appeal

to the audience more than Chuff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<line>
He's got sex appeal...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<line>
- Gravitas...

- Youth...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<line>
- Experience...

- And abs coming out of the wazoo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<line>
And what a wazoo it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:47" />

<line>
- This would put Gekko-Rabitowitz--

- On the map.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

<line>
The map of profitable agencies, that is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<line>
Perfect, because without it

we could be in--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<line>
Real trouble. We did not hit

our projected earnings for the year.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:57" />

<line>
The year's not over yet.

We still have one day to go all out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<line>
Rutabaga, do you think

we have the spunk and moxie--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:03" />

<line>
That's a good name

for a lady detective series.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:05" />

<line>
--required to pull this off

and save the agency?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:08" />

<line>
Hell yeah, I do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:09" />

<line>
That would be a great title

for a movie about marrying Satan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:12" />

<line>
How are we losing money?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:14" />

<line>
Vanessa, we're getting Chuff this part

and coming out on top.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:17" />

<line>
I know we will,

because we're the good guys.

<line>
- Hey, Sarah Lynn.

<i>- Hey, loser.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<line>
Did you get a call

about that <i>Ethan Around</i> thing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<line>
- You're not gonna do it, are you?

- I'm sorry, what thing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>Ethan Around,</i> the <i>Horsin' Around</i>

sequel series Brad's trying to get made?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<line>
{\an8}He called to ask me, I asked him,

can you put a bullet in my brain?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<line>
{\an8}That would probably be

a better career move.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<line>
{\an8}Wait, slow down.

Did you say <i>Ethan Around?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<line>
{\an8}I know.

It should be <i>Sabrina Around,</i> right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<line>
{\an8}That's a show people would watch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<line>
{\an8}Sabrina doing cool skateboard tricks

and eating kettle corn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<line>
{\an8}Hold on, if this was a real thing,

why would Brad call you and not me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
{\an8}Who knows?

Why do people do anything?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
{\an8}Why did I make the cartoon tree grandma

from <i>Pocahontas</i> my emergency contact?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
{\an8}Are you sure this whole thing

isn't just a semi-lucid fever dream

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<line>
{\an8}from mixing the wrong pills?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
{\an8}Did you not hear?

I'm clean and sober, eight months.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
{\an8}Really? That's incredible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<line>
{\an8}Yeah, I wanted a change in my life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<line>
{\an8}Because I heard

if you stop doing drugs for a while,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
{\an8}the first time you do them again,

it's amazing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<line>
-What? No, just stay sober.

-Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<line>
Whatever.

Call me when you're ready to party.

</line>

<line>
{\an8}Well, that's troubling.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<line>
{\an8}Can you believe they're doing

a <i>Horsin' Around</i> reboot without me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<line>
{\an8}What do you care?

You're about to be nominated for an Oscar.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
{\an8}Not the point. This is about respect.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<line>
{\an8}BoJack, is this really a good idea?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
[phone rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<line>
Tools. Brad speaking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<line>
{\an8}You're doing a new show

in the extended <i>Horsin' Around</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<line>
{\an8}cinematic universe and you didn't call me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
Hey, BoJack.

<i>Ethan Around</i> is just an idea I had.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<line>
<i>It's not officially happening or anything.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<line>
I would love for you to be part of it,

but the horse died in the series finale.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<line>
{\an8}So? We could write around that.

The Horse dying was just a dream.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<line>
The Horse had a twin brother,

comes back as a ghost.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<line>
Ethan missed the Horse so much

he built a robot Horse as a tribute.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
{\an8}"I've heard of overloaded motherboards,

but this is ridiculous."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
{\an8}Those are off the top of my head,

they're all gold.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
I'm surprised you're so into the idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<line>
I've been having trouble

getting networks on the phone,

but with a big star like you attached,

we could sell this right away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<line>
I wouldn't say I'm attached...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<line>
Don't move.

I'm getting the next flight down to LA.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<line>
- Right now?

- And purchased.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<line>
BoJack, for the last 20 years

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
I've been telling people

I didn't need the trappings of fame,

that I was better off,

happy with my little B-plus life

at my little B-plus hardware store

in little B-plus Olympia, Washington.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
B-minus children. But it's a lie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<line>
I miss the warmth of the spotlight

on my face.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
The thrill of telling a joke

and feeling it land.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<line>
Is that a thrill you experienced?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<line>
The sitcom stage is my home,

and I'm tired of denying myself that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<line>
I'm ready to come home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
Great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
-Why did you let me call him?

-Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
Ah, smell that Labrador Peninsula air.

Keep an eye out for my brother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
- How will I know which one's him?

- He's the one that looks like me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<line>
- Got it.

- [ringtone] <i>Who's that dog? Mister P--</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<line>
- Hello?

- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
Is this an okay time to talk business?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<line>
Yeah, I'm just waiting

for Captain Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<line>
What is that, like, a cereal?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<line>
No, my brother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<line>
- He's picking us up at the airport.

- Nice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
Speaking of driving people places,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<line>
Cabracadabra

had a killer holiday season

and I think New Year's

is going to be even bigger.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<line>
I'm loving that segue, Todd.

You are a conversational Magellan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<line>
Turns out there's a huge demand

for a safe space for women. Who knew?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<line>
Honestly, never would've crossed my mind.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<line>
So I was thinking, what's the next step?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<line>
What if we made our safe space

for women...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<line>
[crashes]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<line>
...also available to men?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<line>
That's an untapped market.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<line>
All right, then it's agreed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<line>
No goodbye?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<line>
He's a conversational Amelia Earhart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter and

Captain Peanutbutter in the same room?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<line>
What is this, a flashback episode?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<line>
Captain Peanutbutter, you old so-and-so.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
- Get over here.

- [Diane] Careful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
[both laugh]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<line>
Where's Mrs. Captain Peanutbutter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
She's in Alaska running the Iditarod.

She sends her love.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
And this noogie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<line>
Whoo!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<line>
Diane, this is my big brother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
Big brother? I'm five minutes older.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
And you always will be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<line>
It's nice to meet you, Captain.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
Hey, put that thing away.

You're family.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
- [growls]

- [Diane] Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<line>
So David Pincher is about to shoot

the <i>Flight of the Pegasus</i> trilogy

in New Zealand,

and BoJack is perfect for the lead.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
A part like that would really underline

that BoJack's more than just an actor,

he's a movie star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
If I'm doing that,

I conveniently won't be able

to do that dumbass

<i>Ethan Around</i> show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
Use that when you tell him I won't do it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
Why don't you tell him

you don't want to do it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<line>
I can't. I'm like a father figure to him--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<line>
I slept with his mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<line>
- Gross.

- No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<line>
I slept with her 20 years ago.

She was young then, not gross.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<line>
Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
Hey, loved you in

<i>The Caveman's Valentine.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<line>
- Hmm?

- Nothing? <i>The Caveman's Valentine?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<line>
Samuel L. Jackson had that big beard?

Look it up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<line>
- When you start laughing, call me.

- Will do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
Do we have an offer

on the <i>Pegasus</i> movie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<line>
I'll get it, Kalamata.

Don't get your pita in a wad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<line>
Wow. <i>Flight of the Pegasus.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<line>
This must be

what Robert Downey Jr. felt like

when he woke up on that

stranger's bathroom floor

and found out he was gonna be Iron Man.

<line>
Now who let these little monsters

onto my peninsula?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
We're your nephews.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<line>
What? I don't remember my nephews

being made out of candy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
- Gobble, gobble, gobble.

- [all laugh]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<line>
Look at those children.

Little miracles, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<line>
They're adorable, not that

I value them based on their looks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<line>
Because, of course,

children in society today

are often reduced to their cuteness.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<line>
I can't wait to get

to know your children as people,

so I can specifically

compliment them individually

on the foundation of their characters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<line>
Well, one day they'll die, just like us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<line>
- Do you believe in the soul?

- What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<line>
Life is the most precious resource

we have. Remember that, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
[laughs] Pretty great, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
Did you tell your brother

about the A-B-O-R-T-I-O-N?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<line>
The audition?

No, I could never tell him about that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<line>
He thinks I'm offer-only,

it would break his heart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<line>
Wait, what audition?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<line>
- No, the abortion.

- Oh, no. Should I have?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<line>
He said some weird stuff to me earlier.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
The kind of stuff you'd hear

in a sad Creed song.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<line>
Or a happy Elliott Smith song.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
Oh, he's probably just razzing ya,

but he's a good dog. All bark, no bite.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<line>
Sorry, that's a Labrador expression.

I guess in human terms it would be:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<line>
He's all talk, and no shooting you

with an assault rifle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<line>
Is that what you think humans do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<line>
Am I wrong?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<line>
[Rutabaga] Boom! This is David Pincher.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<line>
And this is everyone who works for him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<line>
Now unfortunately for us,

everyone on this board

must really like their boss's movies,

because for the holidays,

they're all <i>Gone Girl.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<line>
Thank you, except for her. Boom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
The assistant to David Pincher's

casting director.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<line>
Wait a second, I know that face.

Why does she look so familiar?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
- Oh, fish.

- Oh, fish.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<line>
So when I found out

that the best assistant I ever had

was working for David Pincher,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<line>
I mean, what are the odds?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
Did he hire you because of your cute

little Benjamin Button-nose?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<line>
I'll put in a good word for BoJack,

but I'm just an assistant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<line>
Just an assistant?

Laura, assistants are everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
You're the first people in,

the last people out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<line>
You know everyone's real name, age,

nose, teeth, and tits.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<line>
You have power, because in today's economy

the only true power is information.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
I want you to use that power.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
I want you to get your boss

to pick BoJack as his Pegasus.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<line>
I always believed in you, Laura.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<line>
The question is:

do you believe in yourself?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
Wow, that's--

I'm sorry, did you just make that up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<line>
Because that was--

Is that a speech you had ready to go?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
- Will you do this for me?

- Of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
You went to bat for me when I tried

to get a promotion at Vigor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<line>
I pushed so hard for you.

I did everything I could.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
I mean, we gals gotta look out

for each other. Right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<line>
Right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<line>
[thunder cracks]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<line>
So you're talking about a merger?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<line>
Since my dad croaked

I've been running Vigor myself,

and I've been doing a pretty good job,

A-minus/B-plus.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<line>
But I could use a few more experienced

hands to help guide the ship,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
- because being a boss is really hard.

- Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn can be a proud woman.

I'm glad you came to me first.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<line>
I would have gone to her directly,

but sometimes she yells at me

and I do not like being yelled at

and that is just something that people

need to understand about me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<line>
I'll talk to her, when the time is right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
[thunder]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
So on the new show Ethan is the dad,

and he's raising three little horses.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<line>
You couldn't have told me

this over the phone?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
This show is going to change my life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<line>
I'm taking the kids out of school

and moving everyone down here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
I just had an offer accepted

on a house in Sherman Oaks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<line>
As long as I don't change my mind

before the new year, boom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<line>
Two million dollars, gone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<line>
- The new year? That's tonight.

- I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<line>
Did you talk to my agent

by any chance?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<line>
- No.

- She didn't call you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<line>
I talked to her, and I don't know

if she wants me to do it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<line>
You know how agents are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
Just remember,

I'm not the bad guy here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<line>
I hear you loud and clear.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<line>
Don't worry.

We won't take no for an answer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<line>
I think my schedule's gonna be tough--

Might be going to New Zealand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<line>
We'll work around your schedule.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<line>
Those bastards got my quote

so damn high.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<line>
We'll pay it.

No obstacle is insurmountable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<line>
- As long as you want to do it.

- And I do want to do it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
Get me out of this thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<line>
This asshole's giving me everything

I ask for. What a nightmare.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<line>
- Tell him you don't want to do the show.

- I can't. It would destroy him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<line>
Destroying people is what I pay you to do,

so I don't think about the people

I'm destroying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
Do you not know what an agent is?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
- [knocking]

- [Ethan] BoJack, are you okay in there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<line>
Is it number one or number two?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
That cat's running circles around us.

What are we going to do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<line>
Maybe we can distract her?

I'm thinking laser pointer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<line>
If we're going to beat her,

we need to think like her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<line>
Instead of convincing the <i>Pegasus</i>

people they don't want BoJack,

what if we convince BoJack

he doesn't want <i>Pegasus?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<line>
Fantastic. How do we do that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<line>
Kelsey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<line>
Kelsey? That's what I said when

they said you wanted to meet with me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<line>
I figured you never wanted

to see me again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<line>
I never want to see anyone again,

but there's a book I've been trying

to turn into a movie and I need your help.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<line>
It's a coming-of-age story

about a girl who likes jellybeans.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<line>
The option expires tonight at midnight,

unless I can find a big enough star

to secure funding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<line>
Frankly, I already gave up on it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<line>
Then my agent said,

"Maybe BoJack's interested."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<line>
So the reason

you think I'm right for the role

is because I'm a big enough star

to secure funding?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<line>
Don't get smart, BoJack.

You're not good at it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<line>
You're really giving the hard sell here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<line>
I hear they've got you locked in

to some fantasy dystopia thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<line>
Are you just gonna do stupid bullshit

for the rest of your life?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<line>
For work or, like, in general?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<line>
I saw something in you,

something most people don't know you have,

and it kills me that instead

of sharing it with the world,

you want to hide it under some

wonderland unicorn nonsense.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<line>
It's a Pegasus. Unicorns are for babies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<line>
The movie I want to make

isn't glamorous or sexy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
You don't get to be the big hero

everybody loves.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<line>
You get to be a guy

who works at a gas station,

who gets in a fight with his daughter

about jellybeans.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<line>
That's the whole movie.

It's small and it's real.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<line>
And you'd get to work

with a director who sees you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<line>
And I can't sell it any better than that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<line>
You're right, that one scene

we shot that didn't even make it

into the <i>Secretariat </i>movie

was the best thing I ever did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<line>
Why am I wasting my time

with this other stuff?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<line>
- So you're in?

- Let's do it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<line>
Great. How's your little friend

with the face?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<line>
Is he up to his old tricks,

getting into scrapes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<line>
[laughs] What a little scamp.

Will you tell him I said hi?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<line>
Kelsey's movie sounds perfect.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<line>
Is it the nobody's-gonna-see-it element

or the fact you'll be working for peanuts?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<line>
This jellybean thing could show the world

that BoJack's more than just a movie star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<line>
- He's an actor.

- Yeah, well, that's great,

but I've been working all day

on getting him the <i>Pegasus </i>movie

you said would show the world

he's a movie star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<line>
I don't want that anymore.

I want to do something real.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<line>
You realize how much money

we'd be walking away from?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
This isn't about money.

Doesn't matter to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
- Yeah, it doesn't matter to you.

- Right. So what's the problem?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<line>
Maybe you can find a way

for BoJack to do both?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<line>
You're supposed to be

this amazing agent, after all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<line>
I'll see what I can do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<line>
New beers for the new year's?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<line>
We got a regular

Maya Angelou over here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<line>
Good times.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<line>
- [cell phone rings]-

- Oh, it's Todd. Gotta take this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<line>
- Maybe you can call him back later?

- Todd!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<line>
Don't be too long,

or I'm gonna drink all your beer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:20" />

<line>
[sighs]

Diane, do you ever look up at the stars

and feel like

they're tiny holes in the sky,

sucking out all the oxygen,

and suddenly you can't breathe

because you're thinking about how small

you are and how meaningless it all is?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<line>
Uh... I guess.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<line>
It's so cruel to let people love you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<line>
All you're doing is promising

you'll one day break their hearts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<line>
Cool fire pit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<line>
So it turns out men love safe spaces

for women even more than women do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<line>
You gotta read some of these comments.

Queefburglar69 says:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<line>
"These sexy lady chauffeurs

always get me where I need to go."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<line>
That's unambiguous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />

<line>
The only problem is some of the drivers

have been complaining

about the new customer base.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<line>
The workers are allowed to complain?

We gotta tighten up that ship.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<line>
Most of the new passengers

are perfect gentlemen,

but we've found that a growing number

are rating our drivers

not on performance but on "bangability",

which creates an unfair advantage

for our "bangable" drivers

and creates what some

of our more homely employees

have dubbed a hostile sexy-ocracy.

Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<line>
Well, our first priority is creating

a safe space for women,

so if our women

don't feel safe in that space,

we should replace them

with women who do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<line>
Where can we find women who are

comfortable around gentlemen?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<line>
I know. A gentleman's club.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<line>
That's perfect.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<line>
To Whale World.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<line>
Well, you didn't hear it from me,

but I pulled some strings and you're in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<line>
I always knew you were a superstar.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<line>
Let's get drinks in the new year

and work out the deets--

That's a fast way of saying details

for people who don't have time

for every detail of the word details.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<line>
Vanessa Gekko on line two.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<line>
Great, put that raggedy-ass bitch on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<line>
I'm gonna bat her around

like a ball of foil.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<line>
I know you're excited, but we are still

in a very precarious position,

and I wonder if foil-ball-batting

is the best tack here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<line>
Judah, this is where I live.

Watch and learn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<line>
Hey, we heard BoJack and Kelsey

had a great meeting on <i>Jelly Belle.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<line>
Gotta tie this up tonight

if it's going to happen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<line>
BoJack would love to do the movie,

but you're gonna have to work

around his <i>Pegasus</i> schedule.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<line>
Oh, um... That might be tricky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<line>
Then you're gonna have to match

his <i>Pegasus </i>quote.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
- He won't do it for a penny less.

- Princess Carolyn--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<line>
Even with a star like BoJack,

Kelsey can't get that kind of money.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
Well, then, work around his schedule.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
You're overplaying your hand, PC,

and I'm calling your bluff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<line>
I'm barreling towards you fast, Gekko,

and this Mack truck ain't gonna blink.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<line>
That's not fair. I was clearly

establishing a poker metaphor,

you just changed it to a game of chicken.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<line>
My court. My rules.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<line>
Court? What game are you playing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<line>
Bye.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<line>
- Damn it!

- Question:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<line>
Am I the faulty bike tire pump

I had in seventh grade?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<line>
Because I just blew this thing wide open.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<line>
- Talk to me, soldier.

- I have been scouring old emails.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<line>
I didn't know what I was looking for.

I knew there was something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<line>
And I found it. Bam!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<line>
[gasps] Hot shit on a ham sandwich,

this is amazing!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<line>
[ringtone]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

Sweet crap on a croissant,

Katie's going into labor!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<line>
Go, I'll take care of this.

Family comes first.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<line>
Thank you. You make me stronger.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<line>
[dance music plays]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<line>
Why is my house filled with sexy orcas?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<line>
It's the Cabracadabra New Year's party.

These are our drivers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<line>
Oh. Uh, where's Emily?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<line>
She left.

She said she didn't feel comfortable here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<line>
She certainly didn't feel comfortable

paying for the food she ate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
Yeah, okay, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<line>
[doorbell rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<line>
I got champagne for my real friends,

'cause that's what you are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<line>
- A real friend.

- He doesn't want to do your show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<line>
- What?

- BoJack is about to win an Oscar.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<line>
Why do you think he would want

to do your soon-to-fail sitcom

about the further adventures

of a carb-faced nobody?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<line>
- Oh, maybe--

- You are not a television star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<line>
You have no talent and I am forgetting

your face even as I'm looking at it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
Pack your bags.

Go back to Nowheresville.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
Thank you for the champagne.

Best regards, Ana Spanakopita.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<line>
Oh, God, the house!

I gotta pull my deposit! Pick up--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<line>
Oh, no. I dropped my phone in a bog.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<line>
Something is going on with your brother.

You need to talk to him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<line>
We don't really have the kind of

relationship where we talk about things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<line>
Labs prefer to keep things playful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<line>
You know what they say about dogs?

Talking to each other is rrruff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<line>
I'm serious, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<line>
And I'm serious that you should drop it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<line>
If something was really wrong,

he would tell me about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<line>
Would he?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
I know he's your brother,

but he's hiding something from you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
Why do you think you know my brother

better than I do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
Just because you have a shitty

relationship with your family

doesn't mean every other family

has to have drama too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<line>
I wanted to come up here

and have a nice time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:09" />

<line>
This place is an escape for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<line>
- Okay, I'm sorry, I just--

- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
I should not have shouted at you.

I just...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
I need to go for a walk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
- Oh, hey.

- Hey, is there something going on?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<line>
Because I know there isn't,

but if there is, you would tell me, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<line>
But there's nothing to tell,

because nothing bad ever happens

on the Labrador Peninsula.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<line>
- Okay, I think you should sit down.

- Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<line>
- I need to talk to you. Sit down.

- I will not sit down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<line>
- Mr. Peanutbutter, sit.

- Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<line>
- I got a twisted spleen.

- No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<line>
It's not fatal, necessarily.

Everything's gonna be fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
They still have to run some tests.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<line>
- But it's going to be fine?

- Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
Promise me it's going to be fine?

You're my big brother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
That means you can't lie to me about this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, you are the best

runt of the litter a guy could ask for.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<line>
No, don't do this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<line>
- But there might come a time...

- Please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<line>
...when you're going

to have to be the captain.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<line>
What is this, a very special episode?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<line>
[both laugh]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
[both howl]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<line>
[howling continues]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<line>
What? What do you mean?

What happened?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<line>
It's a no-go on BoJack for <i>Pegasus.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<line>
<i>I don't understand, Laura. I...</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<line>
I just wanted you to know.

I did everything I could.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
- Hey.

- [Kelsey] <i>Look...</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<line>
If you didn't wanna do my movie,

you should have just told me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<line>
I do want to do your movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<line>
Oh, yeah? Why did your agent

keep demanding more money?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
<i>- What?</i>

- The option's expired and I'm screwed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<line>
Ugh! Why did I get my hopes up?

Why do I keep letting you get my hopes up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<line>
Kelsey, this is a mistake.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<line>
It's a mistake I keep making.

Next time, BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
Do a girl a favor,

don't break her heart by inches.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<line>
Do it all at once.

It'll save everyone some time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<line>
Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<line>
[crowd] Ten, nine, eight...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
Oh, good, you're still here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<line>
I wanted to get a head start

on the 2016 budget.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
It'll be a challenge, but assuming

BoJack books <i>Pegasus--</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
BoJack didn't book <i>Pegasus.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<line>
- So he's doing the jellybean movie?

- That fell apart, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<line>
We're gonna have to cut some costs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<line>
Our social media division

is a luxury we can no longer afford.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<line>
If things don't perk up the first quarter,

we might be looking at broader layoffs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
- Do you ever read a room?

- I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<line>
Is midnight on New Year's a bad time?

I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<line>
Why don't you run that through

your robot analysis protocol?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<line>
Get back to me

once you've assessed the data.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<line>
I am not a robot. I am a human being.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<line>
You want to make some cuts?

Why don't you cut that stupid beard?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<line>
Everyone who walks in here thinks

this place is run by a homeless person.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<line>
I apologize if my appearance

or demeanor is unprofessional.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<line>
[sighs] No, you're perfect.

Everybody's perfect except for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<line>
Go home, Judah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<line>
- Would you like me to shave the beard?

- Just go home, Judah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<line>
Happy New Year, Princess Carolyn.

</line>

[whimpers]

<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<line>
Hello, little ones. Mama loves you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:35" />

<line>
And you. And you. And you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:37" />

<line>
- They're so beautiful.

- And you, and you, and you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:40" />

<line>
- Rutabaga, we got it.

- Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:42" />

<line>
Chuff Hollister is the new Pegasus.

We saved the agency.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:46" />

<line>
- That's incredible, honey.

- Wow, everything worked out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:50" />

<line>
You gotta love a happy ending.
