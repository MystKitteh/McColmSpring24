<p>
Class, settle down. Settle down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<p>
It's Ruthie's turn

to present her ancestor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<p>
-Go ahead, Ruthie.

-Okay, Teach-Bot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<p>
-Mrs. Teach-Bot.

-Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
My great-great-great grandmother

was called Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
She was an agent

and a manager in Hollywoo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
What's the difference

between an agent and a manager?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
Both look to find projects

for their clients

but only managers can produce.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
-[class murmuring]

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<p>
My mom told me that I come

from a long line of strong female cats.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn was the runt of 12

and it made her one of the toughest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
Mom said, "She could take a lickin'

and keep on tickin'."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
This expression refers to clocks,

an old fashioned way of timekeeping

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
{\an8}before we all universally accepted

the bean system.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
[class]

"The bean system is the way."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<p>
For Ancestry Day, I'm gonna tell you

a particular story

about one particular day

on which Princess Carolyn faced

and overcame particular adversity

all the way back in the year 2017.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
-[Ruthie] <i>The day began like any other.</i>

-[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<p>
[Ruthie] <i>Princess Carolyn lived</i>

<i>with her boyfriend, Ralph.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<p>
-<i>She was pregnant and very happy.</i>

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<p>
Sorry I can't go with you

to the doctor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
-Don't worry about it. I feel great!

-Today is crucial.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<p>
Stilton Cards has to create

its own holiday

to really be playing with the big boys.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:26" />

<p>
Hallmark, American Greeting,

those chunky cards that play music

when you open them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<p>
I just know you're gonna be

the next Joey K. Easter,

the guy who invented Arbor Day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<p>
How about

"National Friend of a Friend Day?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:37" />

<p>
-Is that anything?

-You'll think of something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<p>
[slurps]

Mm!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<p>
Give me just a sip of the coffee.

I can have a sip.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:43" />

<p>
-One sip.

-Today is going to be great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:46" />

<p>
Oh--!

[yelps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:48" />

<p>
-Hey.

-[moans] Oh-hh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

[Ruthie] <i>She was wrong.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<p>
{\an8}Or is "Bo for GoJack" better?

Nah, maybe too clever.

</p>

<p>
{\an8}I don't want people to think I'm trying.

Sorry, who is this?

<p>
Princess Carolyn, moron.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<p>
{\an8}-Oh, hey, P.C. So what do you think?

-About what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<p>
"Go for BoJack!" Or maybe--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:14" />

<p>
Ugh, stop!

You need to get a new agent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
I'm sick of fielding your offers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<p>
{\an8}Offers? Well, you tell them

that I am not doing another reality show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<p>
{\an8}So degrading.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
{\an8}All they had at craft services

was Kirkland snacks, P.C. <i>Kirkland snacks.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<p>
Well, first of all, I don't work for you,

so I'm not gonna tell anyone anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
But, second,

these are actually good offers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<p>
-Really? Like what?

-I'm not telling you because--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<p>
Got it. Busy, busy. I'm busy too,

so I'll call you back later. Bye.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
{\an8}-<i>Don't call. I don't work for you!</i>

-How's this for a headline for the blog?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
{\an8}You write about this, quote,

"BoJack Finally Solves Mystery

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
{\an8}of Hollyhock's Mother,

comma, Looks Handsome,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
{\an8}I still don't understand your plan,

or how that's a headline.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
The plan couldn't be simpler.

Go to the county courthouse,

ask to see all the birth certificates

on file, find Hollyhock's,

see what it says in the "mother" spot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
They're not just gonna give you

the birth certificates.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, I gotta try something.

I have this girl at my house

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
{\an8}who came to me for help,

I want to do right by her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<p>
{\an8}I just don't know

if you've thought through--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
{\an8}Diane, I am a famous.

They will give me the birth certificate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
{\an8}Everyone gives me everything I want

all the time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
{\an8}It is an existential curse,

but a huge day-to-day convenience.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
-So why do you need me?

-I don't know. Just wanted some company.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
You told me to use a vacation day

because this was, quote,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
"a feminism-related emergency."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<p>
{\an8}-I got your number!

-Why didn't you just bring Hollyhock?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<p>
{\an8}I was gonna, but she got really

into counting her teeth this morning,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
{\an8}didn't want to leave the house.

You know how teens are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
Ruthie, this was supposed to be

about your ancestor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
-Who are all these other "chara-ca-ters"?

-They fill out the world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
Well, can you try

to keep things focused, please?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<p>
Okay, okay, okay.

[Ruthie] <i>Princess Carolyn had been</i>

<i>called to Gekko-Rabitowitz--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<p>
<i>the agency of her nemesis,</i>

<i>and nemesis-slash-former lover.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
-Ruthie!

-Sorry, Teach-Bot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<p>
She had a lot of former lovers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<p>
She was a fluid sexual being,

not a machine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<p>
[Ruthie]

<i>But today was all about business.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
<i>She was there because she was trying</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<p>
<i>to get her client</i>

<i>Courtney Portnoy cast in--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<p>
<i>Corpse Me If You Can-Can</i>, the 1940's

Cannes, France-set story

of a can-can dancer who contracts cancer

but continues to can-can

as a canny cadaver

who plays the accordion

with Kevin Corrigan, Kevin Kline,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<p>
Chris Klein, Chris Pine and Chris Kattan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<p>
-Got it.

-[gasps] Gekko.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn, hi! Love the dress.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
Is it new, or something I've seen you wear

literally hundreds of times?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
[Ruthie] <i>Normally, Princess Carolyn</i>

<i>would've been rattled,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<p>
<i>but that day, she realized Vanessa Gekko</i>

<i>no longer had any power over her.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<p>
<i>In truth, the woman had challenged</i>

<i>and inspired Princess Carolyn,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
<i>not only to be a better agent,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<p>
<i>but to be brave enough</i>

<i>to try and have it all.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
<i>Princess Carolyn wanted to tell her</i>

<i>thank you, but instead she said...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<p>
-You look tired, "Veronica."

-Oh, I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<p>
Amazing burn, Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<p>
Hey, Princess. We have a little snag.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
Did Chris Kattan drop out?

Right before his comeback?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<p>
Right when the world is finally ready

to settle for Kattan?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
-No, it's--

-You're fired.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<p>
I'm <i>fired?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
I tried to talk her out of it,

but between the gun movie misfiring

and her nuptials

turning into "nope-tials,"

and her blaming you

for both of those things...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
Who knew Portnoy had so many complaints?

Oh, just give me one more chance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<p>
I promise I can get you the lead

in that can-can cadaver movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<p>
[laughs] What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<p>
Oh, P.C., C.P. just made

that whole thing up to get you here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<p>
You thought that was real?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
The 1940's corpse who learns accordion?

It sounds so ludicrous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
You did play the short-sighted seamstress

in <i>The Storm on Northern Fortress.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
Well, yeah, but that was just because

I wanted to work with Ashton.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<p>
We'll talk later, right?

I'm so sorry. Bye.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
Did you have a good meeting?

[mockingly] Did you get fired?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
[groans] Aw.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<p>
Sorry you got fired. Here's a latte.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
Oh, uh--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<p>
-It's decaf, ma'am.

-Thanks, Judah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
You know, one year ago,

a setback like this

would have really spun me out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
But I don't need Courtney.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
Every time we fall, we get back up

stronger and better than ever.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
-Can I get a hallelujah?

-Is that a sort of pressed juice?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<p>
I'll have one hallelujah

on your desk by 12:45.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<p>
Great. What's next?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
I noticed your necklace was broken,

so I pushed back your appointment,

and found a reputable jeweler nearby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
Don't know what I'd do without you,

my hairy number two!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<p>
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

That came out horribly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
Not to speak above my station,

but perhaps it would behoove us to entice

BoJack Horseman back into our stable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
-Ugh!

-I'm sorry, ma'am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
"Stable" and "behoove"

were poor word choices.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<p>
I was not trying to engage in punnery

during business hours,

but we've received 15 more inquiries

about BoJack just this morning,

and I don't think it's wise to look

a gift... opportunity in the mouth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<p>
BoJack is off the table.

We're a small management company.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<p>
We just need to focus

on the clients we have.

One of whom is in the pocket

So I guess it's good you said "no"

to my offer last year.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<p>
What offer? I mean, exactly what offer

are you talking about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
I get so many.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<p>
Last year, I reached out to your guy...

I wanna say, "Ju-do"...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
-Judah.

-This guy's name was Judo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
I offered to buy VIM

and merge it with Vigor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<p>
We would have called

the new company, VIMgor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
Oh, right. That offer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
I couldn't believe

when he said you weren't interested.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
Well, yeah. Because I wasn't,

and he does what I say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
So I guess it all worked out for everyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
You got to start over as a manager,

and instead of buying VIM,

I bought the Utah Jazz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
They're terrible agents,

but they're getting better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<p>
-Yeah.

-Anyway, nice bumping into--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<p>
-Oh, sorry.

-Careful, please. Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
-[Charley] Oopsie. Oh, boy.

-No, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
-[crashes]

-Is that valuable? It is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
My great, great, great grandmother

was dismayed that her trusted colleague

had kept this from her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<p>
<i>Her mind raced,</i>

<i>"Was Judah capable of deception?"</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<p>
<i>She hoped what Charley told her</i>

<i>wasn't true,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
<i>but her instincts told her</i>

<i>the frog wasn't smart enough to lie.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<p>
First quarter, second quarter.

Wow, that's a lot of quarters.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<p>
Oh, excuse me. Hello.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
Judah, you'll never guess

who I just ran into.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
No, I won't. Very astute, ma'am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
-It was Charley Witherspoon!

-Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
-Char... ley...

-Hmm...? Hmm!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
-Wither... spoon!

-Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
-Okay.

-How does that make you feel?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<p>
That very short story

makes me feel nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
I don't think it's your fault

as a storyteller.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<p>
I often have trouble engaging

with narratives.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<p>
[Ruthie] <i>His lack of response</i>

<i>made her hope it wasn't true.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
<i>Could it all have been a misunderstanding</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<p>
<i>involving an enigmatic stranger</i>

<i>named "Judo"?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
So, what's next, then?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<p>
Ooh, I want to get the life rights

to that woman I saw on Instagram

who had a pretty coffee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<p>
I bet we could attach Jessica Alba

and Jonathan Taylor-Thomas by lunch.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
Okay, but I still don't understand

what a manager <i>is.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<p>
Do they just say the names

of movies and actors?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<p>
How does that generate revenue?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
No one knows, Torf. It's not important!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<p>
Be quiet, Torf. Take your Hush Pill.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
Yes, Miss Teach--

[gulps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
Uh-hh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
-Continue your presentation, Ruthie.

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
-And finally, Rob Lowe.

-Great idea, Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<p>
But is it possible you've forgotten

your doctor's appointment?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<p>
-Oh, fish!

-It's my fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
I rescheduled it in an attempt

to make your life easier.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
Thank you, Judah! I'll call you

if I think of any more actor names.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
[sighs]

Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
-God, this is taking forever.

-We've been waiting for 15 minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
I know. Let's just go home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<p>
No, Diane.

How could you even suggest that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
This is not about us.

This is for my daughter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<p>
-Ugh.

-I know what I have to do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
Excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<p>
Important celebrity doing the right thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
-Whoa, a famous guy!

-And he's doing the right thing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<p>
This is like when George Clooney

married that less famous lady!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
-Wait. Don't you mean Jurj Clooners?

-Who cares?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
Hello, friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
-Yes, it's me, BoJack Hor--

-Number?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<p>
I'm sorry, I don't give out

my personal phone number.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
No, your number. You need a number

or I can't help you, BoJack Hor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<p>
Horseman. It's Horseman.

I don't look familiar to you at all?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<p>
-Eh.

-Come on, BoJack. Let's get a number.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
Wait a minute. You're Diane Nguyen!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
I recognize you

from your <i>Girl Croosh </i>avatar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
I loved "Twenty Reasons

to Try the Diva Cup."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<p>
Oh, wow, thanks! You didn't think

20 was too many reasons?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<p>
-No way. Number 14 blew my mind!

-Didn't I say it would?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<p>
We don't have time.

Where do we get a number?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<p>
-That line.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<p>
And you'll need these-- [grunts]

forms.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<p>
Ow, paper cut! Who still uses paper?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<p>
Can't I just swipe an app or something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<p>
-Bye, Diane! Keep up the great work!

-[giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<p>
Oh, get over yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<p>
-[sighs]

-[door opens]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
-So? What's the prognosis?

-Hmm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<p>
I'm trying to think of the best way

to put this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
As Charles Lindbergh would say,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />

<p>
"Sometimes you fly an airplane,

and sometimes you lose a baby."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
In this case, you didn't fly the airplane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
Wait, what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
Your pregnancy is no longer viable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
Well, how do we make it viable again?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<p>
Mm-mm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<p>
How did this happen?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<p>
Goodness, I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<p>
I wouldn't beat yourself up.

Miscarriages happen for so many reasons.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
There's nothing medically wrong with you.

Maybe you just wanted the baby too much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
Maybe you didn't deserve it

because you were unkind once.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<p>
Maybe you ran afoul of a trickster god

or wood nymph who is now exacting revenge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<p>
Oof!

This is... a lot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
Not for me. This is my job,

so... pretty regular day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<p>
What do I do next?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
Well, there's a procedure.

We can do it here later this week.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<p>
You want Darlene to call someone

to drive you home?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<p>
No, I'm okay. I don't need anyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<p>
You're a real tough broad.

Except for, you know, the uterus area.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
Pretty weak.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<p>
-Hey, is my necklace ready?

-Oh, I was going to call you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<p>
When I was working on your necklace,

I realized something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<p>
-Oh?

-It's not actually gold,

it's just gold plated. See?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<p>
No, it's very expensive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<p>
It's pretty, but basically worthless.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<p>
And I'm only saying it's pretty

to make you feel better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<p>
But, it's from the old country.

It's been in my family for generations.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
No, this is costume jewelry

from J.C. Penney.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<p>
Circa 1963.

Somebody just told you a story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<p>
-I'm sorry.

-Wha-- huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<p>
So, do you still want a 24-karat gold

clasp on this garbage necklace, or...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
[sniffles] Oh-hh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<p>
[gasps, sobs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<p>
-[ringtone plays]

-Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<p>
Ralph, hey!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<p>
Hi, honey. Just checking

on how the doctor's appointment went

and also to wish you a happy

"Acknowledge Your Gardener Day."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<p>
It's a work in progress. Don't judge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
The doctor's appointment got pushed back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<p>
I'm actually just walking in now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<p>
Oh, hello. Yes, it's me, Princess Carolyn,

here for my appointment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<p>
I like your perfume.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<p>
There is a painting of a lake on the wall.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<p>
You sure it's okay I'm not there with you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<p>
Ralph, it's fine. I'm a big girl.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<p>
Everything is so easy with you,

Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<p>
I mean, that's why I love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
Yeah, easy. [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<p>
That's what the boys in high school

liked about me, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<p>
[chuckles]

Okay, I'll see you tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<p>
-<i>I love you.</i>

-I love you, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<p>
[beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<p>
[slurps, moans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
Oh, I didn't realize you were still here.

Do you need anything else before I go?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<p>
No. Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<p>
Should you be drinking that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
You don't always know

what's best for me, Judah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
Is everything okay, Princess Carolyn?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<p>
Charley Witherspoon

made you an offer to buy Vim,

and you went over my head

and turned him down without telling me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<p>
Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<p>
-So it's true. You lied to me.

-Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
Because you didn't want to work

at a big agency.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
-You don't fit in with other people.

-I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<p>
You're weird, so you'd rather stay here

where you have all the power.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<p>
No, Princess Carolyn--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<p>
So you lied to me,

and you made me look like an idiot!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<p>
I was trying to protect you. If you heard,

you'd feel like you had to say yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<p>
I don't need you to protect me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
If you had time, you could decide

what to do next

on your own terms, which you did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
Well, that's not your decision to make.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn,

I understand you're upset.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<p>
-And perhaps your emotions--

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
If I can't trust you,

then I can't work with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<p>
You're fired.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />

<p>
Thank you for my time here,

Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<p>
It's been very pleasurable. Until now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<p>
This part is... sad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:11" />

<p>
Don't forget,

you have reservations at 8:00.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:13" />

<p>
-Thank you, Judah.

-Good night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<p>
Ruthie, this story has gotten really dark.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
It has a happy ending. I promise.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<p>
Well, can we get there soon?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
This assignment

was supposed to be six beans long.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
You've already gone on for eight beans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<p>
Okay. I'm almost finished.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
But first, let's check in

with BoJack and Diane again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
What have they been up to?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
[beeping]

Error. Error.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<p>
I'm not leaving

without the certificate!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
I danced your dance, lady.

I filled out that form.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
But I will not wait in this line anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
Not one person in here

offered me a Fiji water,

and I am parched

from all the yelling I've been doing!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<p>
BoJack, let's go home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:52" />

<p>
No, I would like to register

a formal complaint.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<p>
-How do I do that?

-Complaints are on the eighth floor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<p>
But you need to fill out an application

for a complaint registration,

which you can get by waiting

in line 12-B on the third floor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<p>
You have won this round.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
So Princess Carolyn had to meet Ralph.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<p>
<i>But she didn't know how to tell him</i>

<i>what had happened</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<p>
<i>or how he'd take the news.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
Okay, so, what do you think

about "National Paperweight Day"?

Welcome-a back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<p>
Let's have a drink then, yes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<p>
I'll have a glass

of Châteauneuf-du-Pape,

the red wine inspired by <i>Scandal.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<p>
That Kerry Washington has really brought

red wine into popularity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
It's a-funny,

because I thought that the <i>terroir</i>

of the Italian countryside did it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
-But, a-no, it's-a Miss Kerry Washington.

-Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<p>
Everybody love-a Miss-a Kerry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

would love some mint tea. Right?

<i>-Bene, bene.</i>

<p>

there's nothing wrong with me, so--

-I have to go.

-Oh. Well, you want me to drive you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<p>
No, it's fine.

I'll just meet you at home.

So you were lying earlier at dinner?

<p>
Is that what you're upset about?

That I lied?

</p>

-I'm ready!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<p>
I said I was ready.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<p>
So we'll go back to the doctor,

maybe talk about other options.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<p>
I don't need other options.

My mother had 12 kids.

</p>

<p>
My body was made for this.

We just gotta keep tick-tick-tickin'.

<p>
-Five!

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<p>
I've had five miscarriages.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<p>
One last year, now one,

and three others before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<p>
-But it's whatever. It's okay.

-Why didn't you tell me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
Are you kidding?

I don't want you looking at me like that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<p>
Like that! I know I can do this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
You can't keep stuff like this from me.

It's not okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<p>
-It's not about you.

-It is. This is about us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
You're not allowed to be mad at me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<p>
-This is my bad day.

-It's our bad day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
It's so easy for you...

to love me when everything's good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn, I...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<p>
-Let me take you home.

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<p>
You need to live in this.

You need to get used to this,

because if you're serious about having

a baby with me, this could happen again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<p>
Are you prepared for that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
This could happen five more times.

But I'm ready for that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<p>
Because I want this.

Do you want it that bad?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
I just think we should

maybe talk about other options.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
Okay. Here's another option.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<p>
-Get out of my apartment!

-I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<p>
Get out! Save it for your next girlfriend.

which I had earned

because I had good intentions for today,

they're out of my favorite toppings!

<p>

Mm-hmm.

</p>

worked there raised her eyebrows at me.

and you work at a Menchie's."

awful, terrible day?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:42" />

<p>
<i>What?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:43" />

<p>
I imagine my great-great-great

granddaughter in the future

talking to her class about me.

</p>

<p>
She's poised and funny,

and tells people about me

and how everything worked out

in the end.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:53" />

<p>
And when I think about that,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:55" />

<p>
I think about how everything's

going to work out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:57" />

<p>
Because how else could she tell people?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:00" />

<p>
But it's... fake.
