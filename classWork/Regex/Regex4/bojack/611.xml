[Todd] Watch out!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:10" />

<line>
-Lift with your legs.

-I am lifting with my legs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<line>
-Also lift with your arms.

-[Joshua] Is Horse Professor okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<line>
Nothing to see here!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
He just passed out from pride!

Because you kids are so talented!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
[students cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<line>
You think he passed out

from embarrassment?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<line>
-Because the kids are not talented.

-What happened?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<line>
He was getting off a phone call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
I had some constructive criticism

about his play.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<line>
I tried a compliment sandwich

by starting with some praise,

but he passed out!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<line>
Just goes to show,

you never know how much time you have

with someone,

so you should always say

the bad stuff first.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<line>
-[gasping]

-BoJack! Your play sucked!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<line>
They found out. I didn't--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<line>
-It's not true.

-What's not true?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
I need to-- Air.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<line>
[students singing]

<i>♪ For he's our trusty director ♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<line>
No. They can't know.

I didn't even do anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<line>
-It's--

-Slow down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<line>
Why don't you tell us what happened?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<line>
Okay, I'll tell you.

But you can't talk to anyone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<line>
No reporters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<line>
BoJack, it's okay.

No one's gonna talk to any--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
Reporters? With questions about

my good friend, BoJack Horseman?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
I'd be delighted to talk!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<line>
{\an8}[theme music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<line>
[music playing over stereo]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:09" />

<line>
Oh, Baxter,

my endlessly encouraging enfianced.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:12" />

<line>
I'm thrilled to report our return

from a prolonged New Mexican exodus.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:15" />

<line>
True, Max and I shared lodging

to husband our expenditures,

and true, too, we showered together

one night when the tank broke down

and the hot water was scarce,

but other than those mild inconveniences,

the fact-finding mission went as fine

as the print at the bottom

of a contract,

and we're close as ever

to sewing things up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:28" />

<line>
So, BoJack sold the restaurant

to Joey Pogo and me,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:31" />

<line>
{\an8}and we relaunched it with

my fiancée Pickles as a themed eatery.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:36" />

<line>
What is the theme?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />

<line>
Pickles wanted small plates,

Joey wanted lazy Susans,

and I wanted the theme to be my face

is on the front of the menu.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<line>
So, we did all three! [laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<line>
{\an8}-What's the big idea?

-I'm in the middle of eating!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:47" />

<line>
{\an8}Huh? It's the perfect compromise

because everybody got what they wanted,

and nobody had to compromise!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<line>
{\an8}-And why is it called Ele-fee-no?

-Ele-fi-no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<line>
Well, if you don't know, hell if I know!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<line>
I know this last story

is taking its sweet time,

but once we can tie down

this Bo-Person Horse-fellow to Sarah Lynn

on the night of her death,

we'll know he procured the final blow,

the blow being not blow but horse,

a scoop in itself,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<line>
{\an8}but I believe the larger story is--

Oh, but here I am bending your ear.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<line>
Your everlasting patience inspires me.

Do return my call. This is Paige Sinclair.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<line>
{\an8}-And then I took the boat back to LA.

-That's it? How's that a story?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<line>
You did nothing illegal, and even

the not illegal thing, you didn't even do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<line>
And yet this thing continues

to haunt me, I--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<line>
{\an8}-Because it's not about the legality.

-[Todd] Diane's right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<line>
That story is super sketchy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<line>
-Is BoJack super sketchy? Yes, he is!

-[Ruthie laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
-[pounds on door]

-Can Horse Professor come out?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<line>
{\an8} We won't go to the cast party

unless our fearless teacher comes with us!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<line>
{\an8}Why don't you just have the party here

and he'll pop out when he's ready.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<line>
{\an8}Here's some cash.

Go buy some nice cast party things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
{\an8}[students cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
{\an8}[Joshua] This is gonna be

the best night ever!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
{\an8}Okay, okay, you're right.

I've been sketchy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<line>
{\an8}But there's no story here. Right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
-Unless New Mexico isn't the story.

-Uh, what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
I'm just saying, if I tried to pitch

that story, no one would publish it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
They're working on something bigger.

What did you do this time?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<line>
{\an8}I haven't done anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<line>
{\an8}Since I got out of rehab

I have been on my best behavior.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
But before rehab...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
{\an8}No. They can't get me on old shit.

I'm a different person now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<line>
-This could be anything.

-Or a combination of things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<line>
They're gonna combo me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<line>
Let's take a beat

and figure out what this story is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<line>
-Todd, earmuffs.

-On it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
{\an8}BoJack, tell us every bad thing

you ever did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<line>
[sighs] This is gonna be a long night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
So, what can I tell you about BoJack?

Nothing bad, though. [laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
It's gonna be a short night!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<line>
-Right. I-- Your chair, Miss Sinclair.

-Thanks, Mr. Banks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
And thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter,

for taking the time to quench our queries.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
This shouldn't take more than

a half hour, max.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<line>
-Yes?

-No, not you Max.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
-Then who Max?

-No, Max. I'm talking to Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
No, you're talking to Max.

I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<line>
Now I'm talking to Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
-Glad we're all on the same page.

-I beg your pardon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

we have sitch in the kitch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
It's a dishwash ish.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<line>
-The dishwashers all quit?

-It's the small plates.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<line>
If we just had bigger plates,

we could get more stuff on them

and we wouldn't need so many.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<line>
The point of the small plates

is to curate a personalized

dining experience,

but because of your lazy Susans,

all the plates keep getting spun around

and nobody remembers who ordered what!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<line>
Oof! And then there's me,

putting my picture on the menu!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
-What? No one cares about that.

-Yeah, the pic's not the problem.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<line>
All right. JoPo... go, why don't you start

on those dishes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<line>
You got it, good buddy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
Oh... [sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
Pickles, you keep manning the tables.

Those Susans aren't gonna laze themselves.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<line>
Sure. But...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
Could I talk to you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<line>
How much longer do we have

to keep working with that guy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<line>
I thought you loved Joey Pogo!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<line>
I love his music!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
He's my second favorite recording artist

after Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beats

to study/relax to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
I love Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beats

to study/relax to!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
And I love you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<line>
But Joey Pogo's like your total opposite!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<line>
He's arrogant, annoyingly cheerful,

and fake-nice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
You are confident,

refreshingly optimistic,

and wryly sweet

with an ironic self-aware edge

that reads to some as inauthentic,

but I recognize as archly sincere!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
Total opposites!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<line>
Okay. So, Pogo's not gonna work,

but I guess we keep trying?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<line>
I can proposition some young men on set.

That should end well.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<line>
No, I'm sorry. I want this to work.

I'll try to make it work. For us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<line>
Now, if we're to finish this story,

we need to stay focused.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<line>
The last days of Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<line>
I'm telling you, the story is bigger

than just the one girl!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<line>
If we pivot our perspective

so we prove a larger pattern,

we can paint a clearer portrait

of a problematic person

for a page-one profile

that'll pave our path to a Pulitzer!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<line>
Paige, please! At the rate we're going,

we'll never file the story,

you'll remain unmarried,

and I'll be stuck bickering with you

until the day I die!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<line>
Oh, poor baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<line>
Sorry, where were we?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<line>
-We wanted to ask you about Sarah Lynn.

-Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<line>
Before we do, let's widen our frame a tad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<line>
Oh, brother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<line>
-Would you say BoJack is a good person?

-Unequivocally, more or less.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<line>
-More-more or more-less?

-Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
Yes, but back to Sarah Lynn--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
We're trying to understand if your friend

has ever exhibited certain patterns...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<line>
Argyle? Herringbone?

That man can pull off anything!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<line>
We're wasting time. Did Sarah Lynn ac--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
-[dishes crash]

-Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<line>
I told you not to spin it that fast!

Lazy! Lazy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<line>
I'm lazy? Aren't you supposed to be

washing dishes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
[both panting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<line>
-[scoffs]

-Hey! Where are you going?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<line>
Okay, let the cat out of the bag

so my curiosity can kill it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<line>
What is going on with those two?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<line>
That's a personal matter.

I'll tell you all about it!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<line>
[students] Cast party! Cast party!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<line>
We are having a cast party! [cheers]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
-[student 1] Yeah!

-They didn't even buy alcohol!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
Just a disco ball and some capes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<line>
These are all the bad things

you think you did?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
-I swear, this is all I can think of!

-None of these are big stories!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
-We all know there are more things.

-Jesus Christ.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
What's the point of working on myself

and getting sober and getting better

if no matter what, there are people

out there just waiting to tear me down?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<line>
-BoJack, no.

-No, it's not fair.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<line>
If you start listing every single thing

everyone's done,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<line>
-then everyone's a monster.

-Nobody's--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<line>
Who are these reporters, anyway?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<line>
They're so perfect? I'll bet

there's dirt on them we could dig up!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<line>
-I don't think that's it--

-That'll teach those bloodthirsty leeches

what happens when they try to tear

someone down over their past

without even considering the possibility

that he's changed!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
-Have you changed?

-Yes, obviously.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<line>
Because this feels like old BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<line>
{\an8}I like the BoJack who's thoughtful

and directs plays

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
{\an8}that are emotionally resonant despite

the glaring logical gaps in the plot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<line>
{\an8}It was a showcase of separate scenes!

There was no plot!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<line>
I need to go put Ruthie to bed.

Call me when new BoJack's back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<line>
[door opens, closes]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<line>
You didn't do any of the dishes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<line>
Manual labor featuring me

is just not a fruitful collab.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<line>
So I just went out

and bought 500 new ones.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<line>
Why did Mister think I'd like you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
When I'm with him,

we finish each other's sentences.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<line>
Meanwhile, you are always--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
Interrupting, just to say

the exact thing that you were going to?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
-Yes! It's so--

-Annoying?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<line>
Thank you. That's the word.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
Hey, I don't wanna be here either.

You know Joey Pogo wants to bounce.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<line>
What if we just tell Mister

we've formed an emotional bond,

then we can have sex,

and we'll never have

to see each other again!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<line>
-Why don't we just tell him we had sex?

-I can't lie to my fiancé about sex!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<line>
That's what got us into this mess

in the first place!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<line>
[scoffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
So, as soon as they go to bed

with each other,

we can put this whole thing to bed,

but the problem is...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
-She loves him.

-No, the opposite.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<line>
No, the opposite of the opposite.

The very thing itself: she loves him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<line>
Why do you say that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
You've got irises, haven't you?

And pupils and corneas?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
You might even say you've got

a pair of eyes. Optic nerve?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<line>
So how could you not see the way that

she follows him across the restaurant

like the puppy dog she is?

How they bicker and flirt?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
Why would she fall

for a dashing cad like Joey Pogo

when she's already engaged to sweet,

dependable, predictable, safe, boring,

perfectly adequate Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<line>
She only tolerates that other fellow

because she has to, for work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
Otherwise she finds him

utterly distasteful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<line>
Piggish even! No offense to me.

None taken, of course. [snorts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<line>
No, she loves him,

though she'd never admit it,

even to herself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<line>
[gasps] And what about the boy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<line>
Sure, he puts up a front

and picks a good fight,

but to just once hear

those stupid words "I love you"

tumble out of her foolish mouth

would drop his heart down

an elevator shaft

and bounce it back up to his throat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
-Yes?

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<line>
-I'm pretty sure they hate each other.

-Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<line>
I... Well, that's all very...

[breathing rapidly]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<line>
-Back to BoJack!

-And Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<line>
Would you say

BoJack's relationship with her

ever bordered on inappropriate

in the weeks leading up to her death?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
No! They were closer than thieves!

They were thieves, actually.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<line>
They broke into my house together,

like great friends do,

and stole our clothes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<line>
Ask Diane, she never got that jacket back!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<line>
But she was able to find another one

shortly thereafter

that looked exactly the same.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<line>
-Pardon me.

-Hello. Joseph?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<line>
Can I get an announcement drumroll,

please?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<line>
[beatboxing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
Never mind.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
Joey and I have developed feelings

for each other.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<line>
[sputtering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<line>
Wow, I didn't think so soon, but--

No, that's wonderful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
It's exactly what we wanted.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
It is! So now we make love,

after which we can all get on

with our lives.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<line>
Great! This is good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
Look, we're not gonna

figure this out tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
Maybe I should just go

to the cast party and try to enjoy--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<line>
-[Diane and Carolyn gasp]

-[phone buzzing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<line>
-[phone beeps]

-Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<line>
Yes. Um, speaking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
Oh, hello, Paige Sinclair,

of the "Hollywoo Reporter."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<line>
[BoJack and Carolyn gasp]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
Yes, I know BoJack Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<line>
Uh... What night? Did I see BoJack with...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<line>
Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<line>
Listen, I'd love to talk more,

but, uh, I cut my finger earlier

in a bagel guillotine and I think

I require medical attention, goodbye.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
-Bagellotine.

-[phone beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<line>
It's Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<line>
Their story is about you and Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
[exhales sharply]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
[Pickles sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<line>
Well, uh, that was...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<line>
-Wow.

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
Well, see ya later.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<line>
[shuddering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<line>
Hey, I'm sorry I was kind of a dick

to you earlier.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>
The truth is, since Mr. Peanutbutter

has been such a good friend

and chill hang,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<line>
I was nervous

I would feel weird smashing his fiancée,

but once we were in it,

it was like we were two naked hearts

raw and exposed but safe in the home

we found in each other.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<line>
Yeah. Did you just come up with that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
No, it's from my new song,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<line>
"Two Naked Hearts (Raw Dog Remix)."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
-Oh. Sounds like another banger.

-Best of luck with your wedding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<line>
One day I hope to have what you two have.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<line>
Right now, I couldn't even imagine

getting married.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<line>
I can't even commit

to a social media director.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
Why not?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<line>
I'm just having a hard time finding

someone who gets my brand, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<line>
Sexy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<line>
That's exactly right, you totally get me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
So, if you think of anybody who could be

good for the job, let me know, all right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<line>
-I will.

-All right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<line>
I'm headed to the airport now

for another in a series of extravagant

world tours all by myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<line>
At least I'll have

the empty seat next to me

that I always book for extra comfort.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<line>
I'll be at gate six.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
I'm just saying this information out loud

so I don't forget it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<line>
Gate six. Plane boards at 10:38.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<line>
-Wait, Joey!

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />

<line>
Um, here's your jacket back. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
Thanks, Pickles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<line>
Goodbye, Joey Pogo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<line>
So Sarah Lynn. That's okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<line>
-We can spin this.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<line>
What are we spinning?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<line>
You went on a bender with her,

at some point you split up and she died.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<line>
That's the story, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<line>
If you want us to help you,

you need to tell us what's coming.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<line>
You know what I thought?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<line>
The first thing I thought

when I heard Sarah Lynn died?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<line>
Poor BoJack,

that he had to find her like that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<line>
That's right.

Poor BoJack, that's the angle!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<line>
But then I kept thinking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<line>
I wish I didn't,

but my stupid brain kept thinking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<line>
She died of a heroin overdose, yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<line>
And you had heroin, "BoJack" brand,

you kept it in your glove compartment.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<line>
-Diane...

-I didn't wanna think about it,

but I couldn't help but wonder.

Did you give it to her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<line>
I... Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<line>
-Yes.

-And then what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<line>
-You just abandoned her?

-No, I--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<line>
You just left her alone,

an addict, with heroin?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<line>
I didn't leave her, I was with her!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<line>
I was with her the whole time!

I was with her when she died!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<line>
-Like "with her" with her?

-In the planetarium.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<line>
I left and came back

and pretended I'd found her that way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<line>
I... I've never told anyone that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<line>
That's really bad, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<line>
Do the reporters know that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:53" />

<line>
I don't know how they could.

I covered my tracks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<line>
How did you "cover your tracks"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<line>
-[knocking on door]

-[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<line>
Oh. Hey. Uh, what's up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<line>
[Helena] We're doing

end-of-year superlatives,

and we thought it would be cool

if you came out and read some.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
Oh, um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<line>
Just, uh, give me a minute.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<line>
[muffled chatter]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<line>
-This was supposed to be a celebration.

-We can still figure this out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<line>
I'm tired of trying to figure things out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<line>
-Let me just have this one night.

-[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<line>
-[Helena] It's Horse Professor!

-[students laughing, cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<line>
Okay, okay, settle down, settle down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

<line>
Okay. You wanted me

to read these, right? Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:34" />

<line>
-Um, well, for Best Old Man... Terry.

-[students cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<line>
-[Terry] Thank you. Thank you so much.

-Okay. Sit down, Terry. Just sit down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<line>
Sit down. If you start talking,

then we'll all be old! [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<line>
For Best Director...

Oh, Horse Professor. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
-That's me.

-[cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
-[Joshua] Speech!

-No, I-- Okay, okay, okay!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<line>
Okay. Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<line>
I just want to say that I've loved

being here with you this year.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<line>
You've shown me the type of person

I didn't know I wanted to be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<line>
And this semester,

I got to be that person.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<line>
Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<line>
And I just... I want you all

to appreciate this time,

and how special it is,

and how fast it'll all go away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<line>
Please, cherish this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<line>
And I have my own superlative

to announce.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<line>
I, um... [clears throat]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<line>
Oh. Uh, hmm...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:29" />

<line>
For the Best Actor or Actress...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<line>
Oh, my God, it's an eight-way tie!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<line>
-[students cheering]

-[laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<line>
Okay, everyone. Enjoy your party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<line>
[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<line>
Hi, I just gotta tell you

how much I'm loving

the small plates and lazy Susans.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<line>
I put my fork down and I never know

what I'm gonna pull back up!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<line>
-You've really made dinner fun again.

-Uh-huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<line>
And did you notice my picture

on the front of the menu?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<line>
Uh, sure. I mean that part

I could take or leave,

but the small plates and lazy Susans

work together perfectly

to form a completely new kind

of upscale dining experience.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<line>
Exactly like dim sum,

but with white people food,

so it's more accessible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:13" />

<line>
-Oh, well, thank you.

-Huh! Tragic, isn't it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<line>
What is?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<line>
I just keep thinking

about Pickles and Pogo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<line>
They've finally acknowledged

that they love each other,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<line>
-but she's promised to another.

-Yes. To me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<line>
Oh, right!

So, you know better than anyone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<line>
Someone's up to something,

I can tell you that much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, does your ex-wife

regularly consume bagels?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<line>
Hey, why don't you two mind

your own business? How about that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<line>
As payrolled journalists,

our business is minding your business.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<line>
I'm not going to help you

with your take-down piece on BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<line>
-Oh, no?

-He's a good guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<line>
And you have no idea

how torn up he was with Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<line>
In fact, he was with her

in the planetarium when she overdosed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<line>
-He actually gave her the heroin!

-Oh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<line>
Yeah. He told me that once

when he was drunk,

and then he said,

"I've never told anybody that."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<line>
Because he's modest.

So why don't you just leave him alone?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<line>
[huffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<line>
Oh, Max, it's all coming together!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<line>
I could just about kiss someone

if I had someone here to kiss!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<line>
-Listen, I've been meaning to discuss--

-The story?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<line>
It's cooking now. Smell that sizzle?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<line>
We've gotta build on it.

More angles, more leads, more...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:16" />

<line>
-Whoa!

-[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<line>
-Oh...

-My...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<line>
I-- You know, I think our story

is about as wrapped up as a mummy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<line>
What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<line>
I'd better hightail it to the office

and put ink on paper.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<line>
But what about establishing

a larger pattern of behavior?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<line>
We still haven't heard back

from the New Mexico girl

or our contact

at the rehabilitation clinic.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<line>
Don't you think we ought

to keep working together?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<line>
No, I think I ought to get married.

You were right all along, Banks, my boy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<line>
The story is Sarah Lynn. It always was.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<line>
-Taxi!

-[horn honks]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<line>
Wait! Paige! I, uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<line>
-I love you!

-Oh, Max. Of course you do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
Everybody does. I'm Paige Sinclair!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
[tires screeching]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
So, what happens?

When the story comes out, what do I do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<line>
A statement about how sorry you are

about certain parts of the story

but other parts of the story

just aren't true.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
No, you--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<line>
Then in everyone's head

you've apologized for the really bad stuff

without legally implicating yourself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<line>
-Does that work?

-All the time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<line>
No, it doesn't.

Why are you telling him to lie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<line>
Because this is good.

This BoJack here is good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<line>
This is working, but it's so precarious.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<line>
Well, I'm not gonna lose

my job here, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
The Sarah Lynn stuff,

that has nothing to do with this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<line>
-Right.

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
You're about to get pushed out of a plane,

and the two of you are talking

like you're trying to brainstorm ways

to get back on the plane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<line>
That's not gonna happen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<line>
You can try to find a parachute

or you can dive headfirst into the earth,

but the plane is gone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<line>
You're seeing things in absolutes.

We can wriggle out of this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<line>
-Who's "we"?

-Diane, I'm asking you for help.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<line>
This job is my lifeline.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<line>
I think you should do the hard thing

and be honest.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<line>
About everything. Things will get worse

before they get better,

but you won't spend the rest of your life

waiting for the other shoe to drop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<line>
Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<line>
-BoJack, just think--

[Paige] <i>Paige Sinclair,</i>

<line>
<i>Is this a Mr. BoJack Horseman?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<line>
-Y-yes.

-<i>Fabulous.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<line>
<i>We're running a story Thursday next</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<line>
<i>about your relationship with Sarah Lynn</i>

<i> leading up to her death.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
<i>I wanted to give you a chance</i>

<i>to respond to these allegations.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<line>
<i>I presume you will deny them,</i>

<i>as is customary,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<line>
<i>but this is me doing my due diligence</i>

<i>and reaching out for comment, understood?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<line>
Uh, yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<line>
<i>Now, did you supply Sarah Lynn</i>

<i>with the drugs found on her person?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<line>
-No.

-[Diane scoffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<line>
<i>All right. And did you use heroin</i>

<i>with Sarah Lynn during those last weeks?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
-No.

<i>-Uh-huh.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
<i>Were you with her when she died?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<line>
Um... No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<line>
<i>And did you lie to the police</i>

<i>about any of these things?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<line>
No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
<i>-Thank you for your time.</i>

-[line disconnects]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
What happened to being honest?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<line>
I didn't think it would happen so fast.

Did she say next Thursday?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<line>
That gives us a week to plan.

We can minimize damage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<line>
"We" are not doing anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<line>
-Diane, please.

-I can't be a part of this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<line>
I have a book to write.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<line>
[grunts] Oh, my God!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
They're all making out out here!

Go to your dorms!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
You have rooms!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
Well, we did it.

And by "it," I mean <i>doing it.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<line>
Oh-ho! Fantastic.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<line>
So, now we're even,

and everything can go back to normal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<line>
I can't wait. First step:

let's set a date for the wedding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<line>
Joey has a job opening on his tour

that I think could be

a real opportunity for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<line>
Only thing is, I'd have to go tonight,

and I might be gone for a while.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<line>
-Oh.

-Oh, Mister, I'm so confused!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
I feel like my brain is on a lazy Susan,

just spinning in all directions.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
And I know I should be ready

to commit to a main course,

but right now I'm just so excited

about all the different small plates

out there, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<line>
It sounds like maybe this is a bad time

to have my face printed

on the cover of your metaphorical menu.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<line>
What? Oh, yeah.

I forgot about that part of it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<line>
Go on Joey's tour. Have a good time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<line>
And we'll plan the wedding...

when I get back?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<line>
Sure, Pickles... when you get back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
-Sounds like a good compromise.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<line>
Yeah. The best.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<line>
Everyone gets what they want

and no one had to compromise.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
Oh, my God, I gotta go!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<line>
-Okay, I love you!

-Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
Thank you, for everything. [kisses]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<line>
-Hey! Sad Dog!

-[camera shutter clicks]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<line>
-I think the party's over.

-[BoJack] Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<line>
What do you got?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<line>
"My relationship with Sarah Lynn

was complicated,

as relationships between addicts

often are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
However, certain aspects of the story

are inaccurate or exaggerated.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<line>
This story has started

an important conversation

and I look forward to continuing to work

on my own progress..."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
There's-- There's no way

to not sound like bullshit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<line>
Yeah, well...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<line>
This place was supposed to be

a fresh start for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<line>
Rehab was supposed to be a fresh start.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<line>
But no matter how many starts I get,

there's always the same ending.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
Everything falls apart and I end up alone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
-I'm still here, BoJack.

-Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<line>
I don't know. I'm a fool, I guess.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<line>
And you were my first client,

and one time you were drunk

and you smiled at me and I said, "What?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<line>
And you said, "I just like being in a room

with you. You make rooms good."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />

<line>
You still do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<line>
I have loved you for 25 years,

and I never loved anyone better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<line>
That kind of love, you only get it

when you're young and stupid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<line>
I'm not gonna get it again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<line>
And when I tell my daughter the story

of the great love of my life,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<line>
I want it to have a happy ending.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<line>
Is it possible you letting me go

is the happy ending?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<line>
I've gone with you this far.

In for a penny, in for a pound, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<line>
Sunk cost and all that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<line>
Yeah, sunk cost.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<line>
The story's coming out Thursday.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<line>
I don't think that we can get around this,

or over this, or try to get under it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<line>
-Diane is right. We need to go through it.

-BoJack--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<line>
I need to take responsibility.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<line>
I want to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:20" />

<line>
So you can tell your daughter

you helped me do the right thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<line>
-I'll call you tomorrow with a plan.

-I'm looking forward to it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
-You sure?

-I mean, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<line>
