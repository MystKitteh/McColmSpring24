<p>
[Todd] You shut down production?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<p>
Just for a couple of days.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<p>
What is going on over there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
-It's a minor injury issue.

-A stunt went slightly awry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<p>
Again?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
And one of our stars

got a little strangled.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<p>
-What?

-Just a little strangled.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
Like, the minimum amount of strangled.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
Everyone's fine now.

It's like it didn't even happen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<p>
-Except...

-Except what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
Some crew members might have taken

some video of the incident

that could leak to the press

at any moment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
But that's it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
Okay, I'm pulling the plug.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<p>
-[Flip] What?

-No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<p>
It's too dangerous!

We gotta cut our losses.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<p>
Cut your losses?

<i>Philbert</i> is a monster hit!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<p>
We put your site on the map, boy-o,

so don't get squeamish now

about sunk cost.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
Face it: You need us

like a fish needs a bicycle

in Portland, Austin, Boulder,

or Minneapolis, Saint Paul!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
You are out of order.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
Fine. Switch Boulder and Austin

and move the Twin Cities to the front.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
Now, can you give me a chance

to get everything under control?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<p>
-[Henry slams door] <i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

-[Todd sighs] You have one more chance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
Do you promise me

you can take care of this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
I'm clearing my docket.

This is my only priority.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
Good,

because my boss has made it very clear

that if we let him down, he will, quote,

"eat my ass for dinner."

</p>

<p>
{\an8}-[phone beeps]

-Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:19" />

<p>
{\an8}Hey, buddy, well, how ya feeling today?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:22" />

<p>
{\an8}Weird.

Am I supposed to be on set right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:24" />

<p>
{\an8}You just stay right there.

I'm coming over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:27" />

<p>
{\an8}-Okay.

-Do me a favor, though?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:28" />

<p>
{\an8}Maybe don't watch any TV,

or go on the Internet,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:31" />

<p>
{\an8}or take any phone calls

from anybody else until I get there, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<p>
{\an8}-What?

-[touch tones beeping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<p>
{\an8}-Ugh.

-[line ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:36" />

<p>
{\an8}-Stuart.

-What up?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />

<p>
{\an8}Draft an email to Biscuits Braxby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:39" />

<p>
{\an8}I wanna set up an interview for--

Hold on, I'm getting another call.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<p>
{\an8}You want that part in the email?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<p>
-Hello?

-Princess Carolyn! It's Sadie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:47" />

<p>
Remember me? You wanted my baby,

and you came down to Eden,

then you thought about your past a lot,

and I decided not to give you my baby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:53" />

<p>
Of course I remember you, Sadie.

Unfortunately, this isn't a great time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<p>
Anyway, I got to thinking... I interviewed

a lot of people for adoption.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<p>
After I said

I wasn't gonna give them the baby,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<p>
They all went cold or nasty. Except you.

You were still nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<p>
-[tires screech]

-I think that's a sign. [grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<p>
{\an8}-How fast can you get to Eden?

-Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<p>
{\an8}My boyfriend left me,

my mama stole my truck,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<p>
{\an8}-and I don't want this baby no more.

-Oh, fish, Sadie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:14" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm kind of in the middle

of something now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<p>
You're in the middle of something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
I'm about as deep in contractions

as an apostrophe!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<p>
{\an8}-[panting]

-I know. This is all just coming so fast.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<p>
I... Let me call you back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<p>
Okay, but if this baby pops out

and you're not here,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<p>
-I'm putting it in a dumpster.

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
I'm kidding,

I'm giving it to someone else. [grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
-Hey.

-Hi.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<p>
I always forget how tiny

and Dickensian this place is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<p>
It's really great how you don't need

nice things to be happy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
-Yes, I agree. What do you want?

-[door closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
{\an8}For the last couple months,

I've had work to distract me,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<p>
{\an8}but now that we're on strangle hiatus,

I can't stop thinking about that "thing"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<p>
{\an8}that happened in the prepiere

of the <i>Philbert.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
-"Strangle hiatus?"

-Diane, stay on topic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
-You know what "thing" I'm talking about?

-Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
-The thing between us?

-Got it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
When we had sex?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
I was on top and then briefly on bottom.

Human-y style?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
Yep, I remember.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
Pickles has no idea,

and I've never felt so guilty in my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
I hate keeping secrets from people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
It's like Rob Schneider's

surprise party all over again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<p>
You cheating on your girlfriend

is not the same

as Rob Schneider's surprise party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
You're right, this is much less sad

and involves more people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
-Just tell Pickles the truth.

-Oh, I'm not good at giving bad news.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<p>
-Could you do it?

-What? No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
But you're so good at bumming people out.

I'm more of a "good news" guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
You want your ex-wife to explain the fact

that you cheated <i>with </i>your ex-wife

to your current girlfriend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
Well, of course every idea sounds stupid

if you describe what it is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<p>
You're not the only one

who feels gross about that night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<p>
Do you have any idea how shitty I felt

after you left?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
So I made you feel gross, and now...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<p>
No, you didn't make me anything!

I am gross.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<p>
I feel, all the time, like a garbage fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
And not a cozy dumpster in a quaint alley,

but a barge, floating out to sea,

with no rudder.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<p>
I am a rudderless burning

large garbage barge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that way

all the time,

but I don't usually,

and now, for the first time ever, I do,

and I don't know what to do

with that feeling!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
-Good! You should feel bad!

-Well, I do!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
-Great! Me, too!

-Great!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
Great!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
[both moaning, kissing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
{\an8}So, what, exactly,

do you think happened last night?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
I don't know. We shot some stuff?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<p>
There was an accident on set

and Gina got injured.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
{\an8}-Oh, my God, she did?

-She's fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
{\an8}-But some footage has gotten out.

-Footage?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<p>
And because of how it looks,

some people might get the impression

that you were trying to hurt Gina.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
-They're gonna get the impression.

-Right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
-But I wasn't.

-Of course not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<p>
What did happen?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
So, the two of you are gonna do

a sit-down interview with Biscuits Braxby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
[chuckles] She makes news fun!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
Yes. All you need to say is that

you know the footage looks bad,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
{\an8}but you and Gina are actors.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<p>
{\an8}You performed a convincing scene,

and you can't wait

for everyone to see the new season.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
Well, it seems like you've got everything

under control.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<p>
[sighs] I'm sorry things got so messy

with the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<p>
I didn't always look out for you

as much as I should have.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
I can take care of myself.

I know you've got a lot on your plate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
It's just been so crazy,

this adoption process,

but I think once I get a baby,

my life will be less hectic, you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
Oh, sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<p>
That is why new mothers always

seem so chilled-out and well-rested.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
Okay, buddy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<p>
Why don't you save your funny jokes

for the interview?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
But please don't make jokes

at the interview.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
[both sigh]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
Sorry I broke every piece

of furniture you own.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<p>
-Will 20 dollars cover it?

-Don't worry about it. But, yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<p>
-So, what happens now?

-I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
-I have to tell Pickles.

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
-I'll tell her you and I had a talk.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
-And we're getting back together.

-Wait, what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<p>
-But she's a great girl.

-No, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
But she is a great girl.

You just don't know her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<p>
No, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
I don't want to get back together

with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
-What?

-I think you misunderstood.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
-Then why do you keep doing this?

-Why do you keep doing this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
-Because I love you!

-Don't say that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
It's true. I never stopped loving you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<p>
No. We can't do this ever again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
-I'm sorry.

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
See? I told you you were great

at giving bad news.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<p>
That is not what I wanted to hear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
BoJack, Biscuits. Biscuits, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
This interview's gonna go down smooth,

like a 1995 Zinfandel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<p>
You ever try one of those '95 zins?

Good year for Zinfandels.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
Bad year for Oklahoma federal buildings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
-M'kay.

-Here's how it's gonna go down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
Red light on the camera goes bloop!

I go, "Hey!" You go, "Hey!" I go, "Video?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<p>
You go, "Nah!" I go, "Really?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
You go, "Well..." and you roll me

through the rigamarole.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<p>
-Oh, don't--

-Don't forget to plug your show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
Then I go, "Wow. This has been

so illuminating. Thank you so much."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
Red light goes boo-de-de-boop,

we'll be out of here before <i>Traffic.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
And, yes, I'm talking about

the Stephen Soderbergh movie <i>Traffic.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<p>
It's playing on FX tonight,

and I'm hoping to catch it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<p>
Love me some Cheadle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<p>
Am I crazy

or was she kind of hitting on me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<p>
Yeah. You guys have a real flirty energy,

like Matt Lauer and those magazine

cut-outs he now interviews in his kitchen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
-This should be fun.

-Now that's the spirit!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
You gotta show me this video.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
No, I really don't think

that's necessary.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<p>
I'll look like an idiot

if I don't know what I'm talking about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
Just let me see it. How bad could it be?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<p>
Cut to: "Ooh, it's really bad!"

But, no, seriously, can I see it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
-[BoJack grunting in video]

-Hey, wow, look at me go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
-[Princess Carolyn's voice] BoJack!

-Oh. Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
Oh, look out, I'm getting really, um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<p>
Well, this looks like...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
Because I'm actually...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<p>
Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
Diane! What have you been up to?

Tell me everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<p>
Actually, I've been working

on a book of essays--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
Okay, I was obviously asking to be polite,

and it's very rude of you

to assume that I care.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
I have news that's actually interesting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
Girl Croosh is pivoting to video,

and I want you to be <i>the face.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<p>
-The face?

-Of the site.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
Every woman under 40 will tune in

to hear what you have to say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<p>
And possibly women over 40,

but we have no way of knowing

because they're invisible

to our site metrics.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
Stefani... no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<p>
I don't understand.

My parents never said no to me growing up,

so I'm literally incapable

of processing it as a concept.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
I'm a hypocrite. I'm miserable

and I make other people miserable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
I don't know what I'm doing.

I can't be a trusted news source,

or an authority,

or a role model for anybody.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
Uh, no one called you a "role model."

Settle down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
-Oh. Um...

-You know what your problem is?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<p>
You hold everyone

to an impossible standard,

including yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
It's super helpful

for writing hot-take shakedowns,

and clickbait take-downs,

but totally toxic for your personal life

and internalized sense

of self-worth, girl.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<p>
But shouldn't we be asking

more of ourselves

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
-and of the people in our lives?

-Of course. But we all fail, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<p>
The world is unforgiving enough as it is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
The least we could do is find ways

to forgive each other and ourselves.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<p>
Well, then maybe we should be

more forgiving in our content,

and maybe not publish so many take-downs?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
Oh, Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
- All right, let's bring in the talent.

-[mumbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
-[gasps]

-Hey, is this a good time to talk?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<p>
No, Stuart. This is a very bad time.

We're about to shoot the interview.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<p>
Oh, sorry, I haven't memorized

your schedule.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
-You could write it down.

-With what, a quill?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<p>
-Okay, Elbridge Gerry.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<p>
Anyway, this lady showed up

at the office

and she was being super annoying,

so I brought her here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
-What lady? [gasps]

-Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
Why aren't you answering your phone?

Why aren't you in North Carolina?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
We're having a bit of a PR crisis.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<p>
As soon as this is settled

I will take the first plane there,

but this is just not the best time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
Look, if you can't do this, don't do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
My mom worked all the time

and she never made time for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
I felt so alone growing up,

especially because I never knew my dad

or my twin brother

because our parents broke up

when we were babies,

and wouldn't even talk to each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<p>
Oh, Tracy, I had no idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
My whole life,

all I had was this half of a medallion

with part of a family crest on it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
The crest of a family I'll never know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
-Boring.

-Ex-squeeze me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
Sorry, but your story sucks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<p>
I mean, who wasn't separated

from their family as a baby

and still wears their half of a medallion

in the hopes of one day being reunited

with their long-lost twin?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
That exact thing happened to me

and you don't see me bitching about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<p>
-God, get over yourself.

-Get over yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
I didn't realize it was a common thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
Well, obviously it is,

so can you get to your point already?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<p>
I was getting to it

if you'd quit talking already.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
My point is, not every woman is supposed

to be a mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
Maybe you'd be happier

if you freed yourself

from that expectation,

and just lived the life

you'd clearly rather be living.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
Two minutes to air!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
No, that's not... I'm not...

I can't even deal with this right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<p>
-You need to leave.

-All right, let's go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
She's in one of her moods.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<p>
I still think it's pretty nutty

we both have the left half of a medallion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<p>
Like, what are the odds?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
Nah, it's a completely different thing

with me. Mine is the right half.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<p>
-So...

-Oh, okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
[exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
[clears throat] Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<p>
-Hello, BoJack.

-Are you okay? You look good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<p>
Yeah, makeup covered the bruises.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<p>
-Gina, I'm so sorry.

-Let's just do the interview, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<p>
-I'm gonna come clean about everything.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<p>
Everyone needs to know what I did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<p>
-[bell rings]

-[man] Please get in positions.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<p>
No. Don't do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
Gina, what I did to you--

I saw the video and it looked pretty bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
I'll say it was pretty bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
-It was assault.

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
You physically overpowered me,

and if there were any justice,

you would be in jail right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<p>
Okay, so...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<p>
But my career,

after so many failed attempts,

is finally starting to take off.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<p>
I am getting offers, and fan mail,

and magazine columns

about what a good actor I am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<p>
People know me because of my acting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
And all that goes away if I'm just

the girl who got choked

by BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
I can't lie about this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<p>
I don't want you to be the most notable

thing that ever happened to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
I don't want you to be the question

I get asked in interviews

for the rest of my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<p>
-Gina, I--

-You need to do this for me, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<p>
Because I just want this to be over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>
Can we talk about it,

maybe after the interview?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<p>
No. I will be civil to you on set

when we have scenes together,

but otherwise, I never wanna think

about you again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<p>
-Hey, guys, how are we doing?

-So good, Biscuits.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
We're so excited to be here,

aren't we, BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
-Um, yeah.

-[buzzer blares]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<p>
I'm here with BoJack Horseman

and Gina Cazador,

stars of the hit show <i>Philbert.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />

<p>
Let's cut to the chase. That video.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<p>
[chuckles] Oh, my God,

it's so embarrassing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
-This is all a misunderstanding.

-I mean, it's kind of hilarious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<p>
We've actually been laughing

about it here on set!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<p>
[both chuckling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<p>
Really?

BoJack looks so angry in the video.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<p>
And Gina, you look terrified.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
Biscuits, we're actors. It's what we do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<p>
-Oh, thank God.

-Yep, actors.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
Okay, I gotta ask.

Is the story true? Are you two an item?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
[laughs] Busted!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<p>
Oh, boy.

Looks like you got your scoop!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<p>
Can you give us a kiss?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<p>
-Uh...

-Sure thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<p>
[kisses]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<p>
-What's it like dating your co-star?

-It's so great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<p>
I'll bet sometimes, though,

you wanna strangle each other, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
Oh, you bet!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<p>
-[BoJack chuckles]

-[Gina growling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<p>
Okay, you two.

This has been illuminating.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<p>
-Thank you so much.

-[bell rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
-[man] That's a cut!

-That was amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
[Gina] Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
You wanted to see me, Mr. Fondle?

<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<p>
[Henry] <i>I must make love to you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
[chuckles] You mean to my brain,

because I have such good ideas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
Thanks for the encouragement.

I never got that at my last job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<p>
[Henry] <i>Nice boobs.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
That's exactly right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
Those guys were nice,

but they were total boobs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
Anyway, I'm gonna go review

the third quarter budget

with our diagnostics team.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
-[Henry] <i>Insufficient power.</i>

<i>-</i>To review the budget?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<p>
-[panel beeping]

-[Henry] <i>Insufficient power.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<p>
Are you saying I don't have the authority

to do my job?

</p>

<p>
[Henry] <i>Now entering sleep mode.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<p>
You wanna sleep with me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<p>
That is not a mode

I'm comfortable with, Mr. Fondle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<p>
[Henry] <i>Please connect to power source!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<p>
[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
So first, he said

I had insufficient power...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<p>
Wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<p>
Which I have never heard him say

to a man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<p>
And then he asked me to "connect"

to his "power source."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<p>
Did you feel physically threatened?

Was there any implication of assault?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<p>
Not assault, but he did make a mention

of "low battery".

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
It is never acceptable to threaten

an employee with battery at any level.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<p>
{\an8}What time is it right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<p>
{\an8}For female employees

of one popular website,

the answer is Sexual Harassment O'Clock!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<p>
What started with the allegations

of one junior executive

has quickly snowballed

into an avalanche of accusation,

as women at every level have come forward

with their own harrowing stories

of what happens

when the big hand

meets the little hand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<p>
He said he wanted to "...get all up

in my guts with his penis

and ejaculate inside me."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<p>
At the time, I just thought

it was typical corporate banter,

but now I'm like, uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<p>
{\an8}Look, obviously,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
{\an8}men should not be engaging

in predatory behavior at the office,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<p>
{\an8}but I'm worried now the pendulum's

gonna swing too far in the other extreme

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
{\an8}where they'll be held accountable

for that behavior, and that's not ideal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<p>
Uh, Henry Fondle is a sex robot,

and he should not be a CEO

of any company.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<p>
[reporter] When you say "sex robot,"

you're speaking metaphorically, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<p>
No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
{\an8}The board has taken decisive action

to remove Henry Fondle

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<p>
{\an8}by placing him

on an indefinite paid leave.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
Meanwhile, we will be scaling back,

canceling our slate of streaming series

and refocusing on our original mission

of being a website you can go to

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
{\an8}if you don't know what time it is,

that also doesn't harass anyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
{\an8}This is a great day for the women

of this company,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<p>
{\an8}many of whom will be laid off.

You can't write anything

about Gina, but... the other stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<p>
Everything. I need to get it out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
No. I'm done writing about you,

or for you, or with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
Diane, please, I need this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<p>
I'm a bad guy

and the world needs to know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
There's no such thing as "bad guys"

or "good guys."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<p>
We're all just... guys...

who do good stuff sometimes

and bad stuff sometimes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<p>
And all we can do is try to do

less bad stuff and more good stuff,

but you're never going to be good.

Because you're not bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
So, you need to stop using that

as an excuse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
I am asking to be held accountable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<p>
And I'm telling you it's not gonna happen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
Whatever you put in that story,

no one is gonna "hold you accountable."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
You need to take responsibility

for yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
I don't know how to do that!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>

[Princess Carolyn chuckles] Aw.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
She's beautiful.

What are you gonna call her?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
Untitled Princess Carolyn Project.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
But not really, though, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
Hey, do you think my cactus is gonna be

okay if I'm not there for six weeks?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
Yeah, I think

your cactus is gonna be okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
-Is this a mistake?

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<p>
Wow, it feels so weird to be eating here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<p>
So, this is what it's like

from the other side.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
Pickles, I took you here

because I wanted you to be somewhere

you felt comfortable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
Aw, that's so sweet, Mister.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
Because I need to talk to you

about something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
Oh, no, this is really bad.

Why would you do this to me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
I didn't tell you what it is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
No one ever "needs to talk"

about something good!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
No one ever says,

"I need to talk to you: Happy Birthday"

or, "I need to talk to you:

Felicity Jones hired a new stylist

and her red carpet looks this season

are to die for!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
Well, good news first:

Felicity Jones did hire a new stylist,

but sadly,

her fashion choices just aren't popping.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<p>
Oh, no! This is bad news!

Well, thank you for telling me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
That isn't the thing

I was going to tell you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
There's more bad news?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<p>
Is it worse or not as bad

as the Felicity Jones thing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<p>
Well, it's different...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
Whatever it is,

we're going to get through it together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<p>
Whatever it is, I love you,

and nothing's going to change that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
Nothing you say is going to make me

stop loving you, no matter what.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<p>
Pickles... I...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
What is it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<p>
-[grunts] Will you marry me?

-[squeals]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
What do I say... when I go in?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<p>
You say, "Hello. I am BoJack.

Horseman, obviously.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
You've probably heard of me.

I'm very famous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<p>
So... Sober me up, please!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
What if I get sober...

and I'm still the same awful person

I've always been,

only more... sober?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
I think that is a very real possibility.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<p>
-Don't be shitty.

-I'm not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
Rehab is not a cure-all that's gonna

suddenly make you not an asshole.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
Then why are we doing this?

Let's turn around and go home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
-You wanna go home?

-Is that okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<p>
Look, you have two options.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<p>
You can go back home

and try to do things your way,

like you've been doing all your life,

or you can see what these guys

have to offer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
I don't understand

why you're being so nice to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
After everything you know about me,

all the shit I put you through.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<p>
When I was in high school,

I had this friend. Abby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
She was my only friend

and we did everything together,

until she got adopted by the cool kids

and then she turned on me...

so fast.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
She used every secret she knew about me,

every vulnerability.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<p>
She made me miserable

my entire sophomore year.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<p>
But then that summer

when her mom got sick, like really sick,

and all her cool friends were off

vacationing in Martha's Vineyard,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<p>
-I was there for her.

-Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<p>
Because I'm an idiot. And it was Abby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<p>
And I hated her,

and I will never forgive her,

but she needed me and...

she was my best friend and I loved her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
And now... you're here, and I hate you,

but you're my best friend,

and you need me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<p>
[inhales, exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<p>
You know what you're gonna say?

You wanna practice?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<p>
I'm gonna say,

"Hello. I am BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:44" />

<p>
Obviously, you know who I am,

because I'm very famous,

and also we called ahead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<p>
And I am here because... I need help."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />
