[crying continues]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
I need to get as far away

from Los Angeles as possible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
The handy ticketing screens are behind you

and will provide all the answers you need.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
-Can't you just help me?

-Screen has all the answers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
[sighs] I could really use

some personal attention right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
-Where did you want to go?

-I need to leave tonight. Anywhere.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
Uh, okay. Hanoi?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<p>
Vietnam! Yes, perfect!

Thank you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
-Sh-should I punch it into that screen?

-Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
And say nice things about me.

That screen's my supervisor.

-Stefani?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<p>
{\an8}Hey, girl! Just checking up on that

clickable content you were working on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:23" />

<p>
Listen, something came up, and I--

Where are you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:26" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm doing a new, fully immersive,

3-D spin class.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:29" />

<p>
[chuckles] Oh, you know what?

I'm just biking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:32" />

<p>
-Oh. Well, I just landed in Vietnam...

-[growls]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<p>
{\an8}-Where is my content, Diane?

-Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<p>
I need words for my website.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:40" />

<p>
There are words on the website now,

but I need younger words,

newer words, fresher words

to feed the insatiable beast!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<p>
Okay, okay, I'll write something

while I'm here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:49" />

<p>
<i>Number one: To reconnect</i>

<p>
<i>As a born and raised American,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<p>
<i>you never felt much connection</i>

<i>to your Vietnamese heritage,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<p>
{\an8}G'aw! You call that a fastball?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
{\an8}With an arm like that, you're gonna get

booted back to Triple-A, you skeezer!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
{\an8}-Dad, where are we from?

-We're from Boston, dummy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
Why do you think I talk

in this accurate, regional dialect?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<p>
{\an8}I know that, but, I mean,

what is our background?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<p>
{\an8}Why do I look different

from the other kids?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<p>
{\an8}Ah, shove it up your rear, you jack-off.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<p>
{\an8}You're just the same as anybody else,

and don't let nobody tell you different.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<p>
I just thought you could give me

a little cultural context,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<p>
{\an8}what with you being a tenured professor

of Vietnamese history at Tufts and all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<p>
{\an8}Christ, Deedee, that's my job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
{\an8}I wouldn't ask you to have a period

on your day off.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
{\an8}What? Dad, it-- Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
[Diane] <i>But you're here, finally.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
<i>And it's comforting</i>

<i>to see your name everywhere</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>and so many faces,</i>

<i>that look like your face.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
{\an8}-Ah! Oh.

-[speaking Vietnamese]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
-Sorry, I don't-- I don't speak...

-[speaking Vietnamese]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
{\an8}-I don't... I don't understand you.

-[speaking Vietnamese]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
Oh, is this who you were looking for?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
{\an8}-Ouch!

-[speaking Vietnamese]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<p>
[Diane] <i>It's more foreign</i>

<i>than you expected, but that's good.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<p>
<i>You want to truly immerse yourself</i>

<i>and get the full non-LA experience.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
-[bike bell rings]

-Ooh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Because sometimes, to find yourself,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>you need to get as far away</i>

<i>from the world you know--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<p>
{\an8}-Coming through! Hot set!

-Ah! Ah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<p>
[man] Movie lingo!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<p>
{\an8}-[sighs] Excuse me, hi.

-[bell dings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
{\an8}-What's going on here?

-Oh, isn't it exciting?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<p>
Some American filmmakers are shooting

a movie, starring Laura Linney!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<p>
It's about a recently-divorced woman

who comes to Vietnam to find herself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<p>
[Diane] <i>You came here</i>

<i>to reconnect with your roots,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>but now you feel stupid</i>

<i>for even thinking that was possible.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>You put on the clothing you bought,</i>

<i>and... it... feels like a costume.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
<i>This is not your home.</i>

<i>You're a tourist here.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
<i>Reason number two:</i>

<i>you can be a tourist here!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<p>
-[camera shutter clicks]

-[both speaking Vietnamese]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<p>
Can I have number two?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
-Number two?

-Ah. Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
[speaking Vietnamese]

Number two.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
Thank you. [speaking Vietnamese]

[laughs]

</p>

<p>
[Diane] <i>Sometimes,</i>

<i>it's just nice to take a vacation</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<p>
<i>and forget</i>

<i>about everything you left behind...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
-[phone vibrates]

<i>-I'm Peter Sagal. Don't wait, wait.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
-[beeps]

-Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<p>
<i>-Diane!</i>

-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<p>
Are you okay?

You left my party without saying goodbye.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<p>
I was like,

"Uh-oh, what happened to Diane?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
-Well--

<i>-Then I got distracted</i>

because Todd got his tongue stuck

to the ice sculpture.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<p>
<i>By the time we got him off,</i>

his tongue was completely numb,

which made him talk real funny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
-Mm-hmm.

-Well, that got him in quite the situation

when the mob boss, at the roller rink,

thought he was making fun

of his deaf sister.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
I'm sorry,

this is turning into a Todd story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<p>
The point is, are you okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<p>
Oh, yeah, sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
[stammers] I just had a plane to catch,

so... I'm in Vietnam now...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<p>
<i>-Whoa.</i>

-...but... I'll be back soon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<p>
-Let me fetch you from the airport.

-[bike bell rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<p>
Oh, that's okay.

You don't want to deal with the traffic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
You know I love traffic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
I get to catch up on all those hilarious

license plates I haven't read yet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<p>
Okay. Thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
Great. Hey, I have to tell you...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<p>
I'm glad, I'm not still paying

your phone bill

because this call

must be costing a fortune!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<p>
<i>Unless you remembered to call Ed</i>

<i>for the international plan.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<p>
Of course I remembered to do that!

But I have to hang up now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
Our conversation has reached

a natural conclusion, goodbye.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
-[phone beeps]

-Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
<i>Number three:</i>

<i>because you're single now</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<p>
<i>and you can do whatever you want.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
Isn't it great being single?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<p>
[chuckles] It sure is!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
I love that we're mature enough

to still be in each other's lives.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
I know!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
Other divorced couples can't handle it,

but we're handling it, so well,

because we are better than them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
Are we the best divorced couple?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<p>
-I think we might be.

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<p>
How are you doing

with those divorce papers?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
-It's been several weeks now-- Aah!

-Hi, folks! I'm Pickles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
-Ooh!

-Have you dined with us before?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
-Yes.

-Well...

the way it works around here is:

you look at a menu,

pick what you want, I'll bring it to you,

and then you pay at the end.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
So, like, a restaurant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
-Ooh, sounds great.

-Can I get you started with drinks?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<p>
Water would be great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<p>
-Oh, my God, I love water.

-Me, too!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<p>
-Uh-huh.

-I'm 70 percent water!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
-Okay.

-Me, too! What are the odds?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
So, two waters. Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<p>
So... Mr. Peanutbutter,

the divorce papers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<p>
-We need to-- Aah!

-It's me again, the same dog as before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
-Do you know what you'd like to order?

-Are you bringing our waters?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<p>
-No. I forgot. Food, though?

-Hmm, what do you like here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<p>
-No, why would you ask--

-Oh, I like everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<p>
In fact, at the end of my shift,

I usually take everyone's leftover scraps

and put it in a trough and eat it up.

Miam, miam, miam, miam!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
-But don't mention that to my boss.

-We won't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
But that does sound eclectic

and delectable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<p>
The trough of everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<p>
-Okay, and--

-Whoa, somebody's not hungry at all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<p>
-No, I am! I'm very hungry!

-[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<p>
[shouting] And I'll have the Cobb salad!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
-Why do you keep humoring her?

-She's fun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<p>
You know, if we were still married,

this would probably be enough

to spiral us off into a big argument,

that isn't even about the waitress,

and we would fight all night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
But since we're not married,

I can just be like, whatever.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<p>
-This is truly great.

-So... great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<p>
We are doing so great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
Although...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<p>
I do get lonely sometimes

in that big house all by myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
Hey, why don't you have

a housewarming party?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
-Eh...

-Yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
Now that you don't have a mean wife

who hates parties...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
He-he, you can finally live it up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
Okay, but only if you come.

Promise?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<p>
I'll come if you have

those divorce papers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<p>
-Aah!

-Me again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<p>
What did you order?

I didn't write it down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<p>
-The trough!

-Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
He wants the trough!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
Uh, <i>xin... loi.</i>

Do you speak any English?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<p>
We... are... lost.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
I actually speak all of the English.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
-Oh! Your English... is very good.

-I... am... American.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<p>
Yes. American.

We... are.... from... America.

<p>
No. Me America.

-Me America, too.

<p>
Because help is on the way.

-Did you get a longer neck or something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
I did not get a longer neck.

It's a haircut.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
-Does it make my neck look long?

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<p>
Uh, you actually look amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
Don't try to take advantage

just 'cause I'm all vulnerable right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
Jesus, lady!

I'm just trying to give you a compliment!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
-Relax, I was joking.

-Were you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
-[sighs] Let's just go to the party.

-God, you're all over the place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
-You hate parties.

-I don't hate parties.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<p>
-<i>You </i>hate parties. I'm fun.

-Okay, you know what? Forget this.

</p>

<p>
-I'm sorry. BoJack...

-Hey.

</p>

<p>
Your haircut looks great.

Mr. Peanutbutter's gonna love it.

-Hey.

-I love what you did to your neck.

-I didn't--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
Did you see that ice sculpture?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
I am definitely not going to lick it.

Don't worry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<p>
Anyway, I can't stay long

because I'm supposed to go

to the roller rink later.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
-Uh-huh.

-I hope, there won't be

-Well--

<p>
What am I saying? That's so random.

</p>

<p>
-Have you seen Mr. Peanutbutter?

-I don't know. Did you check the library?

</p>

<p>
-Ugh.

-'Kay, I gotta go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<p>
There's a letter I wanna send.

I need to lick the stamp.

</p>

<p>
Hopefully, I'll remember to do it

<p>
-before I put my roller skates on...

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
...so I don't accidentally miss the stamp

with my tongue

and then roll down the stairs

with my tongue out

and then smack right into

the ice sculpture with my tongue.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<p>
That would be pretty bad,

but I wouldn't put it past me.

<p>
-Oh, this? No, I didn't--

-Yeah!

It really brings out the neck

<p>
Okay, well, that's--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
Hey, don't go anywhere, okay?

I want to talk to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
-Oh. [chuckles] How was--

-Erica!

Oh, my God, are you okay?

<p>
Yeah, I'm fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<p>
I can't pick sides in this divorce

with the both of you,

but I want you to know, no matter what,

I'm here for you and also there for him.

</p>

<p>
And if you ever need anything,

just let me know

and I'll be your rock,

as long as it doesn't conflict with me

also being Mr. Peanutbutter's rock,

or my work,

which is keeping me very busy.

Hi, Flip? Yeah, are we sure

we need this strip club set?

Because once we put the deposit down,

we cannot get that money back.

And it's true.

I am Laura Linney.

I'm so sorry to bother you,

but I have to ask,

the movie you were filming,

what happens at the end?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
You get divorced, you go to Vietnam

to find yourself, but then what?

How does it work out?

-Oh.

-My clone.

-Oh.

-And she's shacked up with my ex.

-Hmm?

I fly into a jealous rage

and gut him with a machete,

but not before realizing

that this whole thing

goes all the way to the top.

<p>
So me and my clone have to team up

and head to Dubai.

A lot of it is setting up the franchise.

You know how it is.

-Um... it's an action movie?

-And a love story.

Me and my clone

have a steamy make-out scene,

I... don't know the best way
