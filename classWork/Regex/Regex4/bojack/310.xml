Whoa.

<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<line>
BoJack, you just got nominated

for an Oscar.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<line>
You're an Oscar nominee.

How do you feel?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<line>
[chuckles]

I feel...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<line>
I-I feel...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<line>
It happened again. Why do I keep

thinking things will make me happy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:24" />

<line>
-What is wrong with me?

-BoJack, don't do this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:26" />

<line>
-Don't fetishize your own sadness.

-Uh... Oh, God, I'm drowning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:31" />

<line>
-I feel like I'm drowning.

-BoJack, listen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:34" />

<line>
When I was 17,

I snuck out to a fraternity party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<line>
<i>The roads were icy</i>

<i>and I swerved into the lake.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:44" />

<line>
<i>I came to underwater.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<line>
<i>It was dark and cold,</i>

<i>and I didn't even know which way was up.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<line>
<i>I thought for sure I was going to drown.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<line>
<i>And then... I noticed...</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<line>
<i>when I opened my mouth,</i>

<i>the air bubbles floated up,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<line>
<i>and that's how I knew</i>

<i>which way to swim.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<line>
That is a terrifying story.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<line>
BoJack, when you find yourself lost

and disoriented and underwater

and you don't know which way is up,

it's important to breathe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<line>
I don't deserve this.

I'm not a best actor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<line>
Awards aren't about who's best, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<line>
That's literally the only thing

they're about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<line>
No. All this means is that

you're one of the special people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<line>
I saw it the first time I met you.

You must have known it all your life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<line>
And all your life, people told you

that you were wrong,

that you weren't special,

that you were just like everybody else.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
But now, the special people are saying,

"You were right, BoJack. You were right."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<line>
I was right.

I am one of the special people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<line>
-Yes.

-What are we doing just sitting here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

I just got nominated for an Oscar.

<line>
Hi.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

You get a load

of this chili cheese fountain?

-Grab a handful of beans and go to town.

-Hey, this is all really something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
But I actually just came

because I heard about the nomination

and I wanted to make sure you're okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<line>
{\an8}That's a funny way

of saying congratulations.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
{\an8}But not funny "ha-ha",

more like funny <i>Doonesbury.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
{\an8}I know how this kind of thing

can sometimes send you spinning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
{\an8}"Oh, God, why doesn't this make me happy?

Will anything make me happy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm an empty husk." That kind of thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<line>
{\an8}Well, thank you for that,

but I'm actually doing great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
{\an8}I direct your attention to

the aforementioned chili cheese fountain!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<line>
{\an8}It's too bad I'm not managing

your social campaign anymore,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
{\an8}because this party would make

a great Snapchat story.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
{\an8}You are not gonna make me guilty

about leaving Princess Carolyn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm not here to make you feel guilty.

Like I said--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
{\an8}Honestly, I don't even know

what you're doing over there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<line>
{\an8}-Tweeting for celebrities?

-Well, actually, I don't--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<line>
{\an8}When I met you, you were

so cool and interesting--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<line>
{\an8}Uh, I was never cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
{\an8}You used to actually care about shit.

What happened?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
{\an8}I don't know, BoJack.

Maybe caring about shit got old.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
{\an8}Maybe I'm tired of everyone yelling at me

and sending death threats to my house,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<line>
{\an8}and all my friends thinking I'm annoying,

and getting in fights with my husband,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<line>
{\an8}and seeing little refugee boys

die in hospital bombings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<line>
{\an8}It's exhausting and I can't do it.

If that makes me a bad person,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
{\an8}then I'm sorry that I'm not

the "cool, interesting girl."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<line>
{\an8}I never said you were a bad person.

I just said it's not you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<line>
{\an8}And you know it's not you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<line>

Who are all these people?

-These are my friends.

-Name one of them.

-You're just looking at the Tesla.

<line>

to believe that I could be happy.

-I don't fetishize my own sadness.

Hey!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<line>
I know that you can tweet for a living

in a house in Beverly Hills

that your husband bought,

or you can think you're better

than everyone, but you can't do both.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<line>
-I don't think I'm better than everyone.

-And again, I say, sure.

You know what's gonna happen?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

and you're gonna go up on that stage

and give your little speech,

and then you're gonna go home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
And you're gonna be so miserable,

you'll want to kill yourself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

And you're gonna have nobody left

to stop you.

-So, if I win the Oscar--

Right. But after that,

what's gonna happen to us?

<line>
-What do you mean?

-What we have.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

It's more than

just an Oscar campaign, right?

-I need to go.

-What?

to view such disquieting omens

than through these gorgeous

floor-to-ceiling windows?

</line>

for women.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<line>
Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

Then, it became a safe space

for women and men.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<line>
Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<line>
Now, it's more

of a safe-ish space for women...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
...and a really safe space

for men to look at women...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<line>

<line>
You're not screwing up your life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

if I could start everything over,

knowing what I know now,

I'd do it all right this time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
But other times I think...

[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<line>
No, I wouldn't.

</line>

and, unfortunately,

we have to scale back our staff.

-Are you firing me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<line>
In a sense, yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<line>
But, in another sense,

I'm promoting you

somewhere else.

<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<line>
Yeah. I don't think I ever thanked you

for giving me this job in the first place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<line>
It was an honor to work with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<line>
You were the worst social media

coordinator this company ever had.

<line>
Are you sure you need surgery?

Can't you get a second opinion?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<line>
Second opinion? You know

there's only one doctor on the Peninsula.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<line>
I could ask him twice

if it'd make you feel better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
Nothing could make me

feel better right now.

Not even an amazing career opportunity.

Hold on, I'm getting another call.

I've got to take this. It could be

an amazing career opportunity. Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<line>
[German accent]

Mr. Peanutbutter, this is Shep Von Trapp,

awards show producer,

with a career opportunity

that is... good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<line>
This isn't a great time, Shep.

Could you call back?

</line>

<line>
Absolutely... not.

are you in or out?

Okay, for Best Picture,

what about <i>Avatar?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<line>
-That was a good movie.

-True, but did that come out this year?

</line>

<line>
-I feel like I just saw it.

-Well, there's no way to know for sure.

<line>
Let's just throw it on the list.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

Ooh, do we have Daniel Day-Lewis

down for anything? He's always there.

<line>
Okay. We need one more nominee

for Best Actor. Oh, what about BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<line>
His performance in <i>Secretariat</i>

was as thoughtful and self-aware

as we've ever seen him.

<line>
-Besides, he's our friend.

-Is he?

</line>

<line>
Whoa! I am surprised to hear

you say that, Todd Chavez.

</line>

<line>
-Let's dig into that. We have time.

-I don't think we do.

<line>
You're supposed to be

announcing these, like, now.

</line>

<line>
There is always time

to talk about our feelings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<line>
As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<line>
"There's always time

to talk about feelings,

because feelings

are the ceilings of our hearts,

and a leaky feeling ceiling

leads to a flood of blood.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<line>
And I'm cold.

Will you pass me that blanket?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<line>
Well, I guess I'm just tired

of BoJack walking all over everybody

and still getting everything he wants.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<line>
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I think

the important thing to remember here

is that BoJack is a damaged individual,

struggling against a sea of demons,

many self-created, but still all too real.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<line>
Getting this nomination

from the two friends he loves the most--

you and also me--

would really mean a lot to him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<line>
[sighs]

Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<line>
But did you really think

he was that good in the movie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<line>
Oh, I haven't seen it. It seemed long.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<line>
And the final nominee

for Best Picture is <i>Avatar.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<line>
Well, those are all the nominations.

I will not be taking any questions.

</line>

my brother's surgery was a success.

<line>
And the bad news is,

you're not nominated for an Oscar.

<line>

-No, I don't care about your brother.

<line>
First of all, manners.

Second of all, I think if you met him,

you'd actually really hit it off.

for an Oscar?

<line>
Oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<line>
A lot of people are mighty steamed,

but I feel like what everyone's

overlooking here is,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
I got most of the categories dead-on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<line>
That's pretty amazing, and I am not

getting enough credit for that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
Did you know

that <i>Avatar </i>came out in 2009?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<line>
-I'm not nominated for an Oscar.

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

But you know what they say.

"It's an honor just to be nominated."

<line>
So, I'm just like everybody else.

</line>

<line>
I know you're upset, but whatever you do,

please don't get mad at Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<line>
-Why would I get mad at Todd?

-Exactly. This is totally my fault.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<line>
-He didn't even want to nominate you.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<line>
With the gift of hindsight,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
I see now how that might have

made you even more upset.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
But I realized something today,

when my brother called from the hospital,

and I think it's gonna

make you feel a lot better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

-None of this matters.

<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<line>
[inaudible dialogue]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<line>
As a partner in the company,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
I am prepared to forgo my salary

for the next three months,

but even then, we're going

to need some sort of miracle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<line>
What are we doing?

What was the point of any of this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<line>
I wasted everyone's time for six months.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<line>
Soon, I'll get some offer

from one of the big five agencies

that I can't say no to,

and I'll go back to being another cog

in the giant Play-Doh spaghetti maker

that is this industry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<line>
-Is that the best I can hope for?

-Not necessarily.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<line>
Although, there is one thing

I should probably mention.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<line>
What is it, Judah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<line>
Maybe this is an opportunity

to live one of your other eight lives.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<line>
Yeah, maybe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<line>
It's been a pleasure

working with you, Judah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<line>
I found it to be

an above average experience.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<line>
Please forgive me for getting emotional.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<line>
[Southern accent]

Rye, wheat, or sourdough?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<line>
Can I get it on stale?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
And then, he said,

I fetishize my own sadness.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<line>
[laughing] What did you think was

gonna happen? Why did you go there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<line>
I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<line>
-Did you ask for water?

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<line>
They're not supposed to give us water

unless we ask.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<line>
-Don't they know there's a drought?

-You want to send the water back?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<line>
No, I want the water. I just...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<line>
I went to BoJack's house

to congratulate him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
I'm not trying to pick fights.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<line>
Well, you don't have to see him at all

if you don't want to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<line>
It's not like you work for him anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<line>
-Is he right? Am I a bad person?

-Who cares what he thinks?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
Why do you have

this weird fixation with him?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<line>
I do not have a fixation, Roxy.

I worry about him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
Okay. And last year?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<line>
When you came back from Cordovia

and needed a place to crash?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<line>
Oh, you could have stayed with me,

or any of your other friends,

but you went right to his house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<line>
Did you ever ask yourself why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
They're filling everyone's glasses.

This is insane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
Oh, my God. What do you care?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
Hey, excuse me? Excuse me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<line>
Do you know you're breaking the law

by giving everybody water?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
It's okay. I want the water.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<line>
Yeah, we all want water.

That's not the point.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<line>
In the state of California,

it is illegal for a restaurant

to serve people water

before they ask for it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<line>
There is a drought.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<line>
Sit down! We're thirsty!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<line>
[scoffs] You know,

this is what's wrong with society.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<line>
Diane...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<line>
Nobody thinks about the world

outside themselves.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<line>
So, how you doing?

You still working at that place?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
[line ringing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<line>
-<i>Hello?</i>

-Hi, Ralph. It's Princess Carolyn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
<i>Oh, my God, Princess Carolyn,</i>

<i>I never thought I'd hear from you again.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<line>
I might have some free time coming up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<line>
I was wondering

if you might want to get a drink.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<line>
<i>Okay. So, the night I met you after I said</i>

<i>goodbye, the craziest thing happened.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
Okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<line>
<i>I was walking back to my car,</i>

<i>when all of a sudden,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<line>
<i>-this woman...</i>

-[Carolyn] <i>Oh.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<line>
<i>...tripped on a cobblestone,</i>

<i>twisted her ankle,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<line>
<i>-and tumbled into my arms.</i>

-[Carolyn] <i>What?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<line>
<i>Turns out, she was a ballerina,</i>

<i>and she didn't speak a word of English.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
<i>So, I rushed her to the hospital,</i>

<i>and long story short, we eloped.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<line>
-[Carolyn] <i>Oh.</i>

-I moved to Russia,

and I'm totally messing with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<line>
-None of that's true.

-<i>What?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<line>
I would love to see you again.

I think about you all the time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<line>
-Really? [chuckles]

<i>-Yeah. How about this Saturday?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
It's a date.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<line>
-[metal clattering]

-Ana?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<line>
Uh, no, it's just me,

giant chocolate Oscar guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<line>
I'm here to pick up

the giant chocolate Oscar.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
My boss really wants our product

to only be seen with real Oscar nominees.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<line>
You know, to maintain the integrity

of the giant chocolate Oscar.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
I don't care. Take it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<line>
<i>You've reached Ana Spanakopita.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<line>
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

<i>Explain yourself.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<line>
-[line beeps]

-Ana, this is the fourth time I've called.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<line>
Please call me back. I need you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
Ana, please.

This is BoJack, by the way. Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<line>
Hey! Todd! Where you been?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<line>
-Oh, hi.

-You were in Ojai?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<line>
-No, I was just saying hi.

-Well, why not go to Ojai, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
You and me?

I could use an escape, couldn't you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<line>
It's not really a good time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
Todd, I need this.

You're my best friend and I need you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
Don't leave me now.

Don't be like everybody else.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<line>
I'm not leaving you. I just--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<line>
Besides, I think you owe me, right?

After what you did?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<line>
-What I did?

-Come on, Todd. I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<line>
-Mr. Peanutbutter told me everything.

-Everything?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
Even told you, when I was a kid, I used

to bang on my butt like a bongo drum

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<line>
-when I got out of the bath?

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<line>
<i>♪ Todd-o, me and Todd-o ♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<line>
<i>♪ Bath time come</i>

<i>Make Todd shiny and clean ♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<line>
Mm, no, not-not about that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<line>
So, he didn't tell you everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<line>
Did he tell you about the time

I counted to a million?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<line>
One, two, three, four, five, six--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<line>
-No, stop.

-But I was just getting to the good part!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<line>
What? Seven? He told me you didn't want

to nominate me for an Oscar.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<line>
-Oh, that.

-What the hell, man?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<line>
-After everything I've done for you?

-What are you talking about?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<line>
Oh, I don't know. Letting you live here

for free for six years?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:11" />

<line>
Giving you food, indulging you

in your little projects and adventures

and stories about how you used to bang

on your butt like a bongo drum?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:17" />

<line>
I let you turn my house

into your company's headquarters

for the last month.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:20" />

<line>
Yeah, but that's not

because you're my friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<line>
-That's because you felt bad about Emily.

-You know about Emily?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<line>
I think I know.

Why? What do you think I know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
I mean, I know what I think,

but I don't know if the thing that I think

is the thing that you think I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:33" />

<line>
-You know?

-So, you know I had sex with Emily.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:36" />

<line>
You had sex with Emily?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:38" />

<line>
-Well, what did you think?

-I don't know! Not that!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:41" />

<line>
I just knew something sketchy happened.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:43" />

<line>
I thought maybe you gave her

one of your weird monologues

about how sad you are,

and it bummed her out!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:47" />

<line>
Todd, I'm sorry, all right?

I screwed up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:50" />

<line>
-I know I screwed up. I don't know why--

-Oh, great! Of course! Here it comes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:54" />

<line>
You can't keep doing this!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:55" />

<line>
You can't keep doing shitty things,

and then feel bad about yourself

like that makes it okay!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:01" />

<line>
You need to be better!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:04" />

<line>
I know. And I'm sorry, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:05" />

<line>
I was drunk, and there was all this

pressure with the Oscar campaign.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:09" />

<line>
-But now-- Now that it's over, I--

-No! No, BoJack, just stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:15" />

<line>
You are all the things

that are wrong with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:18" />

<line>
It's not the alcohol, or the drugs,

or any of the shitty things

that happened to you in your career,

or when you were a kid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:24" />

<line>
It's you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:26" />

<line>
All right? It's you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:32" />
