<p>
Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<p>
BoJack, you just got nominated

for an Oscar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<p>
You're an Oscar nominee.

How do you feel?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
[chuckles]

I feel...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
I-I feel...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<p>

the same.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<p>
It happened again. Why do I keep

thinking things will make me happy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:24" />

<p>
-What is wrong with me?

-BoJack, don't do this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:26" />

<p>
-Don't fetishize your own sadness.

-Uh... Oh, God, I'm drowning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:31" />

<p>
-I feel like I'm drowning.

-BoJack, listen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:34" />

<p>
When I was 17,

I snuck out to a fraternity party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<p>
<i>The roads were icy</i>

<i>and I swerved into the lake.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:44" />

<p>
<i>I came to underwater.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<p>
<i>It was dark and cold,</i>

<i>and I didn't even know which way was up.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<p>
<i>I thought for sure I was going to drown.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<p>
<i>And then... I noticed...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<p>
<i>when I opened my mouth,</i>

<i>the air bubbles floated up,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<p>
<i>and that's how I knew</i>

<i>which way to swim.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<p>
That is a terrifying story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<p>
BoJack, when you find yourself lost

and disoriented and underwater

and you don't know which way is up,

it's important to breathe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<p>
I don't deserve this.

I'm not a best actor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
Awards aren't about who's best, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<p>
That's literally the only thing

they're about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<p>
No. All this means is that

you're one of the special people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<p>
I saw it the first time I met you.

You must have known it all your life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<p>
And all your life, people told you

that you were wrong,

that you weren't special,

that you were just like everybody else.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
But now, the special people are saying,

"You were right, BoJack. You were right."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
I was right.

I am one of the special people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
-Yes.

-What are we doing just sitting here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

I just got nominated for an Oscar.

<p>
Hi.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
You get a load

of this chili cheese fountain?

-Grab a handful of beans and go to town.

-Hey, this is all really something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
But I actually just came

because I heard about the nomination

and I wanted to make sure you're okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<p>
{\an8}That's a funny way

of saying congratulations.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
{\an8}But not funny "ha-ha",

more like funny <i>Doonesbury.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
{\an8}I know how this kind of thing

can sometimes send you spinning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
{\an8}"Oh, God, why doesn't this make me happy?

Will anything make me happy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm an empty husk." That kind of thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, thank you for that,

but I'm actually doing great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<p>
{\an8}I direct your attention to

the aforementioned chili cheese fountain!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<p>
{\an8}It's too bad I'm not managing

your social campaign anymore,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<p>
{\an8}because this party would make

a great Snapchat story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<p>
{\an8}You are not gonna make me guilty

about leaving Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm not here to make you feel guilty.

Like I said--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
{\an8}Honestly, I don't even know

what you're doing over there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
{\an8}-Tweeting for celebrities?

-Well, actually, I don't--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
{\an8}When I met you, you were

so cool and interesting--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<p>
{\an8}Uh, I was never cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
{\an8}You used to actually care about shit.

What happened?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
{\an8}I don't know, BoJack.

Maybe caring about shit got old.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<p>
{\an8}Maybe I'm tired of everyone yelling at me

and sending death threats to my house,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
{\an8}and all my friends thinking I'm annoying,

and getting in fights with my husband,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
{\an8}and seeing little refugee boys

die in hospital bombings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<p>
{\an8}It's exhausting and I can't do it.

If that makes me a bad person,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
{\an8}then I'm sorry that I'm not

the "cool, interesting girl."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
{\an8}I never said you were a bad person.

I just said it's not you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
{\an8}And you know it's not you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<p>
Oh, and this party is you?

Who are all these people?

-These are my friends.

-Name one of them.

-You're just looking at the Tesla.

</p>

<p>
I don't know why it's so hard for you

to believe that I could be happy.

</p>

<p>
I'm not like you, okay?

-I don't fetishize my own sadness.

Hey!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
I know that you can tweet for a living

in a house in Beverly Hills

that your husband bought,

or you can think you're better

than everyone, but you can't do both.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<p>
-I don't think I'm better than everyone.

-And again, I say, sure.

You know what's gonna happen?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

You're gonna win that Oscar,

and you're gonna go up on that stage

and give your little speech,

and then you're gonna go home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
And you're gonna be so miserable,

you'll want to kill yourself.

</p>

And you're gonna have nobody left

to stop you.

-So, if I win the Oscar--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
Right. But after that,

what's gonna happen to us?

<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<p>
-What do you mean?

-What we have.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<p>
It's more than

just an Oscar campaign, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

-I need to go.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<p>
There's work to be done.

but now, the real battle begins.

of the outdoor seating area

to view such disquieting omens

than through these gorgeous

floor-to-ceiling windows?

regular windows look like shit.

</p>

for women.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<p>
Ooh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<p>
Then, it became a safe space

for women and men.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
Now, it's more

of a safe-ish space for women...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<p>
Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<p>
...and a really safe space

for men to look at women...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>

-Demand is skyrocketing.

Losing BoJack was a blow.

There's no way to sugarcoat it,

even if I were generally good

at sugarcoating things, which I'm not.

about how much I'm screwing up this one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
You're not screwing up your life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
Sometimes I feel like,

if I could start everything over,

knowing what I know now,

I'd do it all right this time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<p>
But other times I think...

[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<p>
No, I wouldn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

and, unfortunately,

we have to scale back our staff.

</p>

-Mainly, you.

-Are you firing me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
In a sense, yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<p>
But, in another sense,

I'm promoting you

somewhere else.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
Yeah. I don't think I ever thanked you

for giving me this job in the first place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
It was an honor to work with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<p>
You were the worst social media

coordinator this company ever had.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<p>
Are you sure you need surgery?

Can't you get a second opinion?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
Second opinion? You know

there's only one doctor on the Peninsula.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
I could ask him twice

if it'd make you feel better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
Nothing could make me

feel better right now.

<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<p>
Not even an amazing career opportunity.

Hold on, I'm getting another call.

<p>
I've got to take this. It could be

an amazing career opportunity. Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<p>
[German accent]

Mr. Peanutbutter, this is Shep Von Trapp,

awards show producer,

with a career opportunity

that is... good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<p>
This isn't a great time, Shep.

Could you call back?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<p>
Absolutely... not.

<p>
Okay, for Best Picture,

what about <i>Avatar?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<p>
-That was a good movie.

-True, but did that come out this year?

</p>

<p>
-I feel like I just saw it.

-Well, there's no way to know for sure.

<p>
Let's just throw it on the list.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
Ooh, do we have Daniel Day-Lewis

down for anything? He's always there.

</p>

<p>
Okay. We need one more nominee

for Best Actor. Oh, what about BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
His performance in <i>Secretariat</i>

was as thoughtful and self-aware

as we've ever seen him.

<p>
-Besides, he's our friend.

-Is he?

</p>

<p>
Whoa! I am surprised to hear

you say that, Todd Chavez.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<p>
-Let's dig into that. We have time.

-I don't think we do.

<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
You're supposed to be

announcing these, like, now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
There is always time

to talk about our feelings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<p>
As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<p>
"There's always time

to talk about feelings,

because feelings

are the ceilings of our hearts,

and a leaky feeling ceiling

leads to a flood of blood.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
And I'm cold.

Will you pass me that blanket?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
Well, I guess I'm just tired

of BoJack walking all over everybody

and still getting everything he wants.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<p>
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I think

the important thing to remember here

is that BoJack is a damaged individual,

struggling against a sea of demons,

many self-created, but still all too real.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<p>
Getting this nomination

from the two friends he loves the most--

you and also me--

would really mean a lot to him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<p>
[sighs]

Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
But did you really think

he was that good in the movie?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<p>
Oh, I haven't seen it. It seemed long.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<p>
And the final nominee

for Best Picture is <i>Avatar.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
Well, those are all the nominations.

I will not be taking any questions.

</p>

my brother's surgery was a success.

<p>
And the bad news is,

you're not nominated for an Oscar.

<p>
First of all, manners.

<p>
Second of all, I think if you met him,

you'd actually really hit it off.

for an Oscar?

<p>
Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<p>
A lot of people are mighty steamed,

but I feel like what everyone's

overlooking here is,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<p>
I got most of the categories dead-on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<p>
That's pretty amazing, and I am not

getting enough credit for that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<p>
Did you know

that <i>Avatar </i>came out in 2009?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
-I'm not nominated for an Oscar.

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<p>
But you know what they say.

"It's an honor just to be nominated."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
So, I'm just like everybody else.

</p>

<p>
I know you're upset, but whatever you do,

please don't get mad at Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<p>
-Why would I get mad at Todd?

-Exactly. This is totally my fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<p>
-He didn't even want to nominate you.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<p>
With the gift of hindsight,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<p>
I see now how that might have

made you even more upset.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<p>
But I realized something today,

when my brother called from the hospital,

and I think it's gonna

make you feel a lot better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>

-None of this matters.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
[inaudible dialogue]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
As a partner in the company,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<p>
I am prepared to forgo my salary

for the next three months,

but even then, we're going

to need some sort of miracle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
What are we doing?

What was the point of any of this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
I wasted everyone's time for six months.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
Soon, I'll get some offer

from one of the big five agencies

that I can't say no to,

and I'll go back to being another cog

in the giant Play-Doh spaghetti maker

that is this industry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<p>
-Is that the best I can hope for?

-Not necessarily.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
Although, there is one thing

I should probably mention.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<p>
What is it, Judah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
Maybe this is an opportunity

to live one of your other eight lives.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<p>
Yeah, maybe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<p>
It's been a pleasure

working with you, Judah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<p>
I found it to be

an above average experience.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<p>
Please forgive me for getting emotional.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
[Southern accent]

Rye, wheat, or sourdough?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<p>
Can I get it on stale?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
And then, he said,

I fetishize my own sadness.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
[laughing] What did you think was

gonna happen? Why did you go there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<p>
I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
-Did you ask for water?

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
They're not supposed to give us water

unless we ask.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
-Don't they know there's a drought?

-You want to send the water back?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
No, I want the water. I just...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
I went to BoJack's house

to congratulate him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<p>
I'm not trying to pick fights.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<p>
Well, you don't have to see him at all

if you don't want to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
It's not like you work for him anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<p>
-Is he right? Am I a bad person?

-Who cares what he thinks?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
Why do you have

this weird fixation with him?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
I do not have a fixation, Roxy.

I worry about him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
Okay. And last year?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
When you came back from Cordovia

and needed a place to crash?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<p>
Oh, you could have stayed with me,

or any of your other friends,

but you went right to his house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
Did you ever ask yourself why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
They're filling everyone's glasses.

This is insane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
Oh, my God. What do you care?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<p>
Hey, excuse me? Excuse me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
Do you know you're breaking the law

by giving everybody water?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<p>
It's okay. I want the water.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
Yeah, we all want water.

That's not the point.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
In the state of California,

it is illegal for a restaurant

to serve people water

before they ask for it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
There is a drought.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
Sit down! We're thirsty!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<p>
[scoffs] You know,

this is what's wrong with society.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<p>
Diane...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
Nobody thinks about the world

outside themselves.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
So, how you doing?

You still working at that place?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
[line ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
-<i>Hello?</i>

-Hi, Ralph. It's Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
<i>Oh, my God, Princess Carolyn,</i>

<i>I never thought I'd hear from you again.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
I might have some free time coming up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
I was wondering

if you might want to get a drink.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
<i>Okay. So, the night I met you after I said</i>

<i>goodbye, the craziest thing happened.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
Okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
<i>I was walking back to my car,</i>

<i>when all of a sudden,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
<i>-this woman...</i>

-[Carolyn] <i>Oh.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<p>
<i>...tripped on a cobblestone,</i>

<i>twisted her ankle,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
<i>-and tumbled into my arms.</i>

-[Carolyn] <i>What?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
<i>Turns out, she was a ballerina,</i>

<i>and she didn't speak a word of English.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
<i>So, I rushed her to the hospital,</i>

<i>and long story short, we eloped.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
-[Carolyn] <i>Oh.</i>

-I moved to Russia,

and I'm totally messing with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
-None of that's true.

-<i>What?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<p>
I would love to see you again.

I think about you all the time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<p>
-Really? [chuckles]

<i>-Yeah. How about this Saturday?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<p>
It's a date.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<p>
-[metal clattering]

-Ana?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<p>
Uh, no, it's just me,

giant chocolate Oscar guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
I'm here to pick up

the giant chocolate Oscar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
My boss really wants our product

to only be seen with real Oscar nominees.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<p>
You know, to maintain the integrity

of the giant chocolate Oscar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<p>
I don't care. Take it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
<i>You've reached Ana Spanakopita.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<p>
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

<i>Explain yourself.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
-[line beeps]

-Ana, this is the fourth time I've called.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<p>
Please call me back. I need you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<p>
Ana, please.

This is BoJack, by the way. Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<p>
Hey! Todd! Where you been?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<p>
-Oh, hi.

-You were in Ojai?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
-No, I was just saying hi.

-Well, why not go to Ojai, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
You and me?

I could use an escape, couldn't you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
It's not really a good time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
Todd, I need this.

You're my best friend and I need you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<p>
Don't leave me now.

Don't be like everybody else.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
I'm not leaving you. I just--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
Besides, I think you owe me, right?

After what you did?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
-What I did?

-Come on, Todd. I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
-Mr. Peanutbutter told me everything.

-Everything?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<p>
Even told you, when I was a kid, I used

to bang on my butt like a bongo drum

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<p>
-when I got out of the bath?

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
<i>♪ Todd-o, me and Todd-o ♪</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
<i>♪ Bath time come</i>

<i>Make Todd shiny and clean ♪</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
Mm, no, not-not about that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
So, he didn't tell you everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
Did he tell you about the time

I counted to a million?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
One, two, three, four, five, six--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
-No, stop.

-But I was just getting to the good part!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<p>
What? Seven? He told me you didn't want

to nominate me for an Oscar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<p>
-Oh, that.

-What the hell, man?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<p>
-After everything I've done for you?

-What are you talking about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<p>
Oh, I don't know. Letting you live here

for free for six years?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:11" />

<p>
Giving you food, indulging you

in your little projects and adventures

and stories about how you used to bang

on your butt like a bongo drum?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:17" />

<p>
I let you turn my house

into your company's headquarters

for the last month.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:20" />

<p>
Yeah, but that's not

because you're my friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<p>
-That's because you felt bad about Emily.

-You know about Emily?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<p>
I think I know.

Why? What do you think I know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<p>
I mean, I know what I think,

but I don't know if the thing that I think

is the thing that you think I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:33" />

<p>
-You know?

-So, you know I had sex with Emily.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:36" />

<p>
You had sex with Emily?!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:38" />

<p>
-Well, what did you think?

-I don't know! Not that!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:41" />

<p>
I just knew something sketchy happened.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:43" />

<p>
I thought maybe you gave her

one of your weird monologues

about how sad you are,

and it bummed her out!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:47" />

<p>
Todd, I'm sorry, all right?

I screwed up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:50" />

<p>
-I know I screwed up. I don't know why--

-Oh, great! Of course! Here it comes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:54" />

<p>
You can't keep doing this!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:55" />

<p>
You can't keep doing shitty things,

and then feel bad about yourself

like that makes it okay!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:01" />

<p>
You need to be better!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:04" />

<p>
I know. And I'm sorry, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:05" />

<p>
I was drunk, and there was all this

pressure with the Oscar campaign.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:09" />

<p>
-But now-- Now that it's over, I--

-No! No, BoJack, just stop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:15" />

<p>
You are all the things

that are wrong with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:18" />

<p>
It's not the alcohol, or the drugs,

or any of the shitty things

that happened to you in your career,

or when you were a kid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:24" />

<p>
It's you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:26" />

<p>
All right? It's you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:25:32" />

<p>
Fuck, man.
