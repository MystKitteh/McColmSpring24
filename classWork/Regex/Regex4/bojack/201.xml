</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
<i>And I am a horse. Do you get it?</i>

<i>Do you get my joke about the track?"</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<line>
<i>- There's a whole page of this.</i>

<i>- Should I write him, tell him I get it?</i>

[Dick]

<i>He goes on. "My question for you is:</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<line>
<i>I am a good kid and I like to play,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<line>
<i>and I like to go to school,</i>

<i>but sometimes I get sad.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<line>
<i>What do you do when you get sad?</i>

<i>How do you not be sad?"</i>

<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<line>
[father] Is that to impress me?

I can smash a dinner plate, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<line>
[mother] That's a salad plate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<line>
[father]

I thought these were salad plates.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<line>
[mother] Those are saucers.

[father] Why do we even have saucers?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<line>
We don't drink tea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
[mother]

Those saucers are for entertaining!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<line>
[father]

Oh, yeah? Well, I'm exit-taining.

</line>

Do you get it?

[mother groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<line>
Don't sit so close to the TV,

it'll make you cruel.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<line>
You know, I was beautiful

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<line>
- before I got pregnant.

- I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<line>
- You ruined me, BoJack.

- I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<line>
You better grow up to be something great

to make up for all the damage you've done.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>
I will.

Okay, enough me being a great mom.

I'm gonna go hide

your father's heart medication.

- BoJack, why did I wake up in an alley?

- I had to get rid of the old couch, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<line>
While I was sleeping on it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<line>
The couch was a metaphor

for my old attitude.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<line>
My audiobook told me I had to let go

of the burdens of my life sofa.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<line>
Oh, you know what?

Maybe it was "my life so far."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<line>
I feel like

you could've woken me up first.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<line>
Todd, no one can wake anybody else up.

You need to wake yourself up.

</line>

{\an8}I don't know if I trust this new guy.

I'm just gonna go sleep in your car.

- Uh-oh. I think someone needs a FAB.

- A FAB?

FAB, stands for fresh active BNA.

- BNA?

- Brand-new attitude. Try to keep up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
ATTITUDE stands for attention to--

<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

{\an8}I gotta go.

One of my dumb-ass clients is here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
{\an8}Just out for a jog, thought I'd say hello.

I jog now.

You jogged here from Laurel Canyon?

<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<line>
I drove, but I moved my arm a bunch,

so the Fitbit counted the miles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
{\an8}Uh, someone named BoJark Hoseman

is here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<line>
- Thank you, Stuart.

- Also, your coffee is coming late.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
- Just like you ordered.

- I said "latte."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<line>
{\an8}Ah. Well, I wrote down "late,"

so that's what it's gonna be.

</line>

This <i>Secretariat </i>movie is a big deal.

Please do not blow it.

{\an8}You know, when I won that Golden Globe

last month, I went to a very dark place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<line>
I was in a hole.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<line>
And I realized, "I can wallow

in this hole or I can change."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
While I was tempted to go with the former,

sometimes the only way out of a hole

is a latter.

- No pun intended.

- You clearly intended that pun.

you gotta believe in the AHP of TPE.

<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<line>
Huh.

- Uh-uh. I'm not asking.

- The awesome healing power--

<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
- I am not asking.

- --of total positive energy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
You should leave because

I'm about to pretend to get a phone call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
Hello? [chuckles]

No, he's still here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

- No, he's not taking the hint somehow.

- Mm-hm.

Honey, where's my bandana?

You chewed it up,

we had to throw it away, remember?

<line>
[Mr. Peanutbutter] No, not that one.

With the meat juice stains?

The one I wore to the Emmys.

<line>
I don't know. I gotta go.

BoJack's gonna be here any minute.

<line>
Did you check the hall closet?

<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<line>
[Mr. Peanutbutter]

I can't see anything in this stupid thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<line>
I know, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

But you gotta keep it on

for one more week.

- Loving it, buddy. Loving life.

- Brother, I am right there with you.

I got a brand-new attitude

<line>
- Uh...

- Is that a new cone? Looking sharp, PB.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
It is a new cone.

Is it obvious I'm wearing a cone?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<line>
Didn't notice.

You've got the smile of a winner.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<line>
- What's going on?

- I have to wear the cone

so I don't gnaw on the stitches I had

to get when I punched a mirror last week.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
I got drunk and thought my reflection

was another dog. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
I was so mad at that other dog.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<line>
He was wearing my clothes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
- We've all been there.

- I don't understand what's happening.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<line>
Did someone say something to the left?

Diane, is that you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<line>
Hey, why don't we just us two schedj

a hang for this 'kend?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<line>
"'Kend" is how I say weekend now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<line>
Uh, I love that. And I got a pair of tix

to the 'Stones show this 'kend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
- Wanna go?

- The Rolling Stones?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<line>
What? Oh, no, no, no.

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<line>
I'm not really familiar with that outfit,

but I do love trying new things.

<line>
- Who are you?

- Anyway, we gotta get to work.

- What?

- Because each minute

I spend talking to you,

that's how much money I'm wasting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<line>
A complex role that requires

a precise touch and a deft hand

and I just can't wait to tackle it

head-on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
It's truly an honor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<line>
<i>Namaste.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<line>
Neat. So, in this scene,

Secretariat's at his lowest.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
He just lost his first race,

his father was sent to the glue factory.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<line>
It's a dark moment.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<line>
- You got it.

- Scene 22 alpha, take one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<line>
[inhales, then exhales]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<line>
- [Kelsey] Action!

- Hey, Secretariat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<line>
[campy] What are you doing here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<line>
[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<line>
[mumbles, then chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<line>
[Kelsey groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>
[phone buzzing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<line>
- Hello?

- Diane!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<line>
I can't tell you how disappointed I am

you're not here with me

in Northern Cordovia.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
I'm incredibly disappointed. Boo!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<line>
I didn't think I could do it,

but I did it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<line>
I'm amazing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<line>
Sebastian,

I know you're doing important work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<line>
I couldn't just drop everything

and fly to the Third World.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<line>
- I just got married, and--

- [Sebastian]<i> Diane.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<line>
People are dying, and I'm witnessing it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
And I need people

to witness me witnessing it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<line>
I know, and I'll be there in three months,

as soon as I'm done on the movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
This is also important.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<line>
In a way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<line>
Well, lucky for you,

there'll still be just as much famine

and war and devastation

in three months.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<line>
I'm not dead yet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<line>
- Yep. Lucky me.

- [man] We're still rolling, people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<line>
So, BoJack, in this scene,

Secretariat is sad, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
Afraid he's gonna lose his scholarship.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<line>
Oh, sure. Yeah, sad. Of course. Duh.

[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
Okay, here we go. Action.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<line>
Hey, Secretariat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<line>
[campy] What are you doing here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
That was bad. I know that was bad.

Let's keep it rolling.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<line>
- I'll say when to keep rolling.

- Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
What are you doing here? Did we get it?

I can tell by your face that we didn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<line>
All right, let me try again.

What are you doing--?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<line>
I am having trouble with the words.

Is it okay if I play around with it a bit?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<line>
When did you get here?

Sorry, no. Got it. Got it. Got it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<line>
Man, these lights are bright, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<line>
Can we kill these lights at all?

Is that a--?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<line>
- No.

- Okay, I'm sad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<line>
I'm sad. Acting sad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<line>
Secretariat is sad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<line>
Okay, here we go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
I'm sad!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<line>
Sorry, what was the line?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<line>
I don't know if this helps or not,

but when Secretariat was a kid

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<line>
- he actually--

- Aah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<line>
- My face!

- [man 1] Hey, hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<line>
- Whoa, whoa!

- [man 2] Oh, my God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<line>
[man 3] Watch out!

[man 4] Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
[man 5 gasps]

[man 6] Whoa, whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
[PA] Oh, my God. My face.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<line>
My beautiful face.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
Why didn't someone tell me

not to trip over that cable?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
It was such an important job,

but no one was there to do it

and now my face is in ruins.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<line>
We're gonna need a couple of days

to rebuild this set.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
So, let's all just use this time

to regroup

and really figure out what we're doing

and why we're here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
[audience laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
So, let me get this straight.

Bad means good?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
Maybe you should leave the teen-talk

to me. Jeezy Kableezy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<line>
[audience laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
Well, it wasn't Ibsen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<line>
That's your takeaway?

That your son's TV show wasn't Ibsen?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<line>
I'm sorry. Did you need a compliment?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<line>
Oh, I loved the part where you got

your head caught in the banister.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<line>
- Yeah--

- And what's this letter I have?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
It's from the government saying,

"I'm proud of you."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<line>
- Are you--?

- No, what I'm holding is nothing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<line>
Can you check on our drinks?

I would love some gin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
I wouldn't drink anything out of an open

container. This town is full of AIDS.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<line>
- That's not--

- You're a clown, you know that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<line>
You've always been a pillar of support.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<line>
Gin, please? Is there gin coming?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<line>
I'm here, aren't I?

I suffered through that ordeal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
You know, the man sitting next to me

was wearing a T-shirt?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<line>
A T-shirt, BoJack, in the theater.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<line>
Yes, a T-shirt.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<line>
Worst thing that's happened to anyone

in a theater.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
- The T-shirt told me to "just do it."

- Here we go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<line>
I don't know to what "it"

the T-shirt referred

but I won't be spoken to in that tone

by an article of clothing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<line>
Vodka? Triple sec?

Looking for any alcohol.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<line>
You don't know how lucky you are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<line>
I hope you die before I do so you never

know what it's like to lose a mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<line>
As long as one of us dies,

that's good enough.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<line>
Can we please get some alcohol

into my mouth?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<line>
[man on recording]

<i>The past is past.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<line>
<i>That's why it's called the past.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<line>
<i>Tomorrow is an opportunity.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<line>
<i>You can be big and proud</i>

<i>and bang on your tom-tom drum</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<line>
<i>or you can get in your boat and row.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<line>
<i>Tom or row.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<line>
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<line>
- Hey, do you wanna talk?

- Talk? Why? Why would we do that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<line>
So you can put everything

in a book and sell a million copies?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<line>
Wow. Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<line>
That's what the old me would have said.

The new me doesn't hold a grudge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<line>
[phone rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<line>
- No.

- I gotta say,

the new you seems a little on edge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<line>
What? Me?

I'm as cool as The Fonz in a meat locker.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<line>
That's a metaphor, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<line>
- It's a simile.

- Goddamn it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
[phone rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<line>
Oh, okay. Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<line>
Small talk, small talk, small talk.

Are you blowing it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<line>
- I heard you're blowing it.

- What? Who told you that? Was it Todd?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
You gotta turn this ship around, BoJ.

If you don't--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<line>
Hey, can you hold on a second?

I'm getting another call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:53" />

<line>
Well, if it isn't my friend, Rutabaga,

the boy prince of the 26th floor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<line>
Carolyn.

How are things all the way up on 27?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<line>
Stomp once for good, twice for killing it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<line>
Killing...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<line>
Give me some gossip.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<line>
My wife is making me go

to the opera tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<line>
I need something to distract me

from the thought of D-bags

singing songs in German

about their boners.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<line>
Okay, you gotta

keep this close to the vest

but I am inches

from getting Emily VanCamp

the lead in Goose Van Sant's

new movie about Jackie O.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
My clients would f-l-ip

if I got them parts like that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<line>
You're killing it

in the department of kicking ass

in regards to you being an agent

and being good at it, crushing it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<line>
You're not so bad yourself, Rutabaga,

for a 26er. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<line>
You're the only one in this building

who isn't a total snooze-cooze.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<line>
Yes, Natasha, I'm talking about you.

I know you're listening.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
Ugh. I gotta go. I made Natasha cry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<line>
[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<line>
I don't think she's coming back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<line>
Could we keep it down

in the front, please?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<line>
- Thank you.

- What am I gonna do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<line>
Well, you were an actor for nine years

on <i>Horsin' Around. </i>How did you do that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<line>
Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<line>
- Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

- Of course, buddy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<line>
I always have time for you,

my good friend BoJack

in this, the year 1988.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<line>
Have a seat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<line>
[stomping overhead]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<line>
Hey, enough with the stomping already!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<line>
- Am I-- Am I a clown?

- Oh, brother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<line>
Didn't I tell you not to invite your mom

to the taping?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<line>
As Max Headroom would say,

"Your m-m-mom is a b-b-bitch." [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<line>
But I am a good actor, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<line>
BJ, I don't know. Look--

You know what you're good at?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<line>
Hitting your mark, saying your lines,

loudly with good diction.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<line>
Should I be doing more?

To capture the character

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<line>
- and make the audience connect?

- This is a situation comedy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<line>
No one watches this show to feel feelings.

Life is depressing enough already.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<line>
You bring joy to millions of people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<line>
Maybe someday later,

you'll need to learn how to act for real.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<line>
But for now,

[chuckles] don't worry about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<line>
Oh, shit. I'm not an actor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<line>
All this time, I assumed there was more

to me than everyone thought

but maybe there isn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<line>
That's the part where you're supposed

to disagree with me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<line>
Oh, right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<line>
Well, you got the part, didn't you?

What did you do in the audition?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<line>
Well, how should I know?

That was the old me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<line>
Now I've got a brand-new attitude.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<line>
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.

What should I do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<line>
Start a new life there?

Meet a local girl? Fall in love?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<line>
Talk my way into a job at a textile plant?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<line>
Work my way up until I own the place?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<line>
What am I talking about?

I can't run a textile plant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<line>
Too much responsibility. What am I

gonna do? The walls are closing in!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<line>
BoJack, breathe. You can do this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<line>
You have two days.

Maybe you could hire an acting coach.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<line>
- Yeah?

- Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<line>
Plus, you can watch old

Secretariat videos.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<line>
I've got a hard drive full of research.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<line>
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

You're right. I can do this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<line>
I've got two whole days.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
And when the pressure's on,

that's when I shine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<line>
Yeah. Two days.

I can do all those things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<line>
Oh, shit. I didn't do any of those things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<line>
- What are you doing here?

- Ah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:16" />

<line>
That was it. Say that again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<line>
[campy] What are you doing here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<line>
- Okay.

- No?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<line>
BoJack, before we get started

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<line>
- I wanted to show you this.

- What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<line>
This is the machine

that's gonna make you a good actor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<line>
- Really?

- No. We need to make a scan of your face

so that if you die,

we can finish the movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />

<line>
Standard procedure. When a star

is assessed to be of a certain liability,

like if there was a whole book written

about what a reckless jackass he is,

you make a digital replica so you're

not screwed if he goes all Belushi on you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<line>
- Wait, which Belushi?

Six months later,

plugging a movie on <i>Kimmel.</i>

<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<line>
I gotta go on <i>Kimmel </i>now?

What if he makes me read a mean tweet?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<line>
I'm not emotionally prepared.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<line>
Don't worry so much.

If you can't do this part

we'll just fire you and get someone else

who can. Either way, I'll be fine.

- What do you need, BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<line>
I don't know. I thought I wanted this,

but now I'm feeling all this pressure.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
- Think you made a mistake, hiring me?

- I don't make mistakes, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<line>
I do the crossword in Sharpie,

I never learned the shortcut for undo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<line>
- Command-Z.

- Don't need it, won't use it.

</line>

I'm trying to have this new attitude,

be this better, more positive guy.

</line>

I keep thinking about how this movie

is my last shot at happiness.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<line>
Well, BoJack, I hope this helps:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<line>
I don't care if you are happy or not.

</line>

<line>
Yes. I am a writer. What do you need?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<line>
Can you write on a sign

"watch out for cable"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<line>
You were telling people,

but it's a really important job

and a sign is less likely

to get distracted.

Oh. Yeah. Okay.

- So, I went a little overboard

and I made you two mixes.

<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<line>
The first CD is all Mighty Mighty.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<line>
The second CD is all of the Bosstones'

side projects and solo singles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
Listen to it and imagine the band

never took that hiatus

in the mid-aughts

when America briefly lost interest in ska.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<line>
I don't have time.

I don't wanna listen to your music.

I don't wanna hang out.

Get out of here.

[Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles]

All right. You don't wanna listen

to Bosstones together.

<line>
That's the impression that I get.

BoJack, listen, I know you're scared,

but it's gonna be okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
- You gotta be strong.

- Yeah, but--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
You gotta rise to the occasion, okay?

So what if the new couch is weird?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<line>
- Or lumpy?

- Uh, what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<line>
What are you gonna do?

Just sleep in BoJack's car forever?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<line>
- Are you talking to me, or you--?

- Damn it, time to stop being a coward.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<line>
It's time to go home

and sleep on BoJack's couch. Hurray!

Charley Witherspoon, 28th floor agent.

Charley. Listen, I wanted to touch base

about Emily's start date on Jackie O.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<line>
Oh, yeah. Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

Well, we got some new screen tests

and, uh, Goose decided to go

in a different direction.

<line>
Are you saying the Van Sant camp

wants to recant on VanCamp?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

Because they can't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<line>
Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<line>
Charley, you better get your client

to change his mind

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
- or I'll walk up to the 28th floor and--

- Just kidding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<line>
- I can't get to the phone right now.

- What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<line>
This is one of those answering machines

that sounds like it's Charley talking

but it's actually

just an answering machine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<line>
- I know you're there, Charley.

- Leave a message.

about the opera, though?

Loved Tristan, loved Isolde,

cried like a bunny.

Listen, my brain has been a-buzzing

for the past few days

thinking about that Jackie O movie.

<line>
I know it's your baby,

but I did make a few calls

and got my Rooney a screen test.

<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<line>
I put that movie together for my client.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<line>
No, no, no, don't freak out.

It's just a screen test.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<line>
But, honestly,

how fantaj would my Rooney be

as a young Jackie Bouv?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<line>
Stomp once for so fantaj,

twice for stupid-fantaj.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
Carolyn? I only heard one stomp.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

You're beautiful.
