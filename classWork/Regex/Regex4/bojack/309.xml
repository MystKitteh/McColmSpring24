<p>
- [sighs]

- [cell phone rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<p>
BoJack! Beautiful day, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
Perfect day to go outside,

not read the trades

or talk to anyone in the industry

or watch entertainment television

or have a gut feeling about the ratings

for your television show last night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<p>
- Princess Carolyn, I'm dying.

- You read the trades.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
My heart is in my stomach,

my stomach is in my butt,

and my butt ran away with the spoon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<p>
That makes sense

because your butt is quite a dish.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
Can you come over? I need you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<p>
What the...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
I ordered a few feel better pizzas

to feel better. It did not work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
Then I sprinkled happy pills on them,

and washed it all down

with a "Please, God, make my pain go away"

vermouth and ice cream float.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
- Somehow I feel worse.

- That's a real mystery.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
My show was terrible.

Why did I insist on a mockumentary format?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<p>
It's already an overused trope now,

in 2007.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<p>
Mockumentary is not a trope,

it's a device for storytelling.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<p>
And your show is daring and cutting edge.

People just aren't ready.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<p>
Yeah, people! It's not me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<p>
It's the people that are the problem!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<p>
Everyone's dumb and I am great.

Why do I always forget that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<p>
That's the spirit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<p>
I'm starting to think this show is

the best thing that happened to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<p>
- Really?

- Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<p>
It made me realize you're the best thing

that happened to me,

with your sexy cat eyes

and your cute little hair curl.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<p>
You look like a soft serve

strawberry ice cream.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<p>
BoJack, we can't. I'm your agent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<p>
You are so much more than that.

You're my lighthouse, my Garmin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:48" />

<p>
You're the little plastic table

they put in pizza boxes

to keep the pizza from getting smushed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<p>
You're Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:55" />

<p>
[both moan]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<p>
Don't you break my heart,

BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<p>
- What?

- What? Nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />

<p>
- Did you just say something to me?

- No, I was just being wistful, I guess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<p>
Well, can you be wistful a little quieter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<p>
- Not everyone is interested in your wist.

- Okay, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<p>
- You smell nice.

- Thanks, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
{\an8}[Carolyn laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<p>
{\an8}Okay, gotta go. I'm about to meet

my most important client.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<p>
{\an8}- I know you're not really on the phone.

- Bye, Mr. President.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
{\an8}Give my love to your basketball friends.

You too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
{\an8}Should we get dinner,

or are you just thinking drinks?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<p>
{\an8}- I'm not planning on staying long.

- Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm glad you wanted to meet,

because I am so pumped to tell you

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<p>
{\an8}all about the exciting projects

I'm lining up for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<p>
{\an8}That won't be necessary.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
{\an8}Once you get your Oscar nom,

we'll have our pick. That's the key.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<p>
{\an8}You think Halle Berry

would've been offered <i>Catwoman</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
{\an8}if she wasn't an Oscar winner?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
{\an8}We just gotta find you your <i>Catwoman.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm not sure if a <i>Catwoman</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
{\an8}is really the best thing

for my career right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
{\an8}Right, well, like I said,

we are getting lots of offers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
{\an8}Listen, Princess Carolyn--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Signore </i>Horseman!

<i>Principessa </i>Carolina!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
{\an8}Sandro, how you doing,

you handsome devil?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
To be honest I am, how you say,

sweating bull's nets.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
- You mean sweating bullets?

- I don't think so.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<p>
Sweating bullets.

How does that make the sense?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<p>
How does sweating bull's nets

make sense?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<p>
{\an8}I don't want to be caught in bull's nets.

He may try to kiss me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<p>
{\an8}I prefer kissing cows. No judgment,

just a preference. I love kissing cows!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
{\an8}Don't tell my wife. I'm kidding!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
She knows. She's a cow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
And I only kiss her.

[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<p>
Okay, very good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
Haven't you lived in America for 30 years?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
Ignore him. Why are you

sweating bullets and/or nets?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<p>
Because there is a restaurant critic

here tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
Very interesting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<p>
Critics are the worst.

That's my review of critics.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<p>
Two thumbs down! Four percent fresh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<p>
One star! You all eat a flat butt!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<p>
Did you not know there was a critic here?

You own this place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<p>
I never see you do anything

to help run it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
This place runs itself. Right, Sandro?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
My wife and children and therapy man

may not agree so much,

but if you say so, <i>Signore </i>Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
Even his wife and kids

and therapy man agree.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<p>
Well, as the Black Guy Pete say,

"Tonight's gonna be a good night."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
Please. Enjoy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
I know you're not happy about

what happened with the Kelsey project.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<p>
I pushed a little too hard to get you

the money you deserve.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
What can I say? Sometimes I'm too good

of an agent, so deals fall apart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<p>
That's a thing that happens

when agents are really good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<p>
- That's not--

- Moving forward!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<p>
I know you're not happy

with how I handled <i>Ethan Around.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
- Or didn't handle it.

- Bygones!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<p>
It was because I was busy

getting you the <i>Pegasus </i>movie,

which I know you did not get,

but trust me,

you'll see not getting these movies was

the best thing that ever happened to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
Onwards and upwards!

Tally ho! To the stars!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
Okay, you're forcing me to use the cards.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<p>
"Princess Carolyn, clear throat,

I have been very disappointed--"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
Ring! Hello, Your Highness.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
It's a king, I have to take this.

In the bathroom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<p>
Oh, fish, oh, fish!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<p>
[woman] Who's out there?

Are you talking to me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
No.

[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
All right, Pink Lady, think.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<p>
- [woman] Are you talking to me?

- Are you a pink lady?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<p>
[woman] I was a Pink Lady in my high

school's production of <i>Grease.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
- Were you Rizzo?

- [woman] No, Jan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
Then don't waste my time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
Now, let us bow our heads and bray.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
[all bray]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
[whispers]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<p>
Yes, right away!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<p>
So back to what you were--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
- Oh, my goodness, what is this?

- Yeah, what is this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<p>
<i>Happy 23 years working together</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<p>
<i>- Join me</i>

- Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
<i>- Twenty-two-three, 23 years</i>

<i>- Twenty-three years</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<p>
You're making this up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<p>
<i>Happy 23 years working together</i>

<i>Can you believe this?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
<i>- Two plus three equals 23</i>

- This is just stream of consciousness.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
<i>Twenty-three years working together!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<p>
<i>Twenty-three years</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
Okay, cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<p>
Can you believe it, BoJack?

It's been almost a quarter of a century.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
Talking on the phone

pretty much every day,

sharing our deepest dreams and secrets,

being there for each other

through all of it, bosom friends,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<p>
<i>Anne of Green Gables</i> style.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
Let's toast to another 23 years.

What do you say?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<p>
- You're fired.

- Uh-- Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<p>
I can't believe this. You're firing me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<p>
- Me?

- What? No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<p>
You have no idea,

everything I do around here!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
- Half the kitchen staff is my family.

- No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
- Honestly, just--

- I detest you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
I hope you rot in the hell!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
- We're headed down a road that--

- You washed-up has-been no-good joke!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<p>
You are the opposite of an onion,

because if I cut you, I am no gonna cry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
Well, now you are fired.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<p>
Good luck finding another charming

first-generation Italian immigrant

with this kind of darling accent,

who makes equally delightful malapropisms!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
You, sir, have just cut off your nose

and thrown Sprite in your face!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
I am a classic stereotype

that is tough to come by nowadays,

because Italians don't emigrate

so much to America no more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<p>
Botticelli, Barbarelli, Beetle Bailey!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<p>
Modigliani, Masaccio, Marmaduke!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
<i>Avanti,</i> all of you! <i>Andiamo!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<p>
[laughs nervously]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
So that was weird, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
Please stop looking at me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
Too bad about Sandro, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
You're the one who's fired, obviously.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
Right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<p>
Ryan Murphy is doing a re-imagining

of <i>The Life and Times of Harriet Tubman.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
But in this version, she's a tub-man,

with the comparative strength

and agility of a tub!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
- PC.

- He's looking for someone

to play the Underground

Railroad conductor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
Great, but you don't represent me anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
Okay, I get it. I'm fired.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<p>
You're gonna spend a couple of days

being mad at me,

then I'll get you another gig, and you'll

be my client again, just like every time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
Can we get past the part

where you're mad at me

and get to the part where

you're stealing General Lee's plutonium

to fuel your subterranean

steam-punk slave-tram?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
"It's best, for both of us,

if we end this relationship

once and for all."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
I'm sorry I screwed up,

you don't have to read off the--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
"You take me for granted, made decisions

that were against my wishes,

and worst of all

she's got my globes a-warming!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
- How did that get in there?

- What is that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
A punch line to a joke

from the roast of January Jones.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
- A global warming joke?

- It's an important issue. Here we go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<p>
"Our relationship no longer has any--"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<p>
"January has only gotten hotter and hot--"

Nope.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
- Were you at the roast of January Jones?

- No, but I wrote some jokes

in case someone got sick

and they needed a backup.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<p>
Do you even know January Jones?

Why would they call you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<p>
I guess I thought that my agent could

get me in the mix if Jason Sudeikis--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<p>
How did these get out of order?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<p>
So in the joke,

are the globes your balls?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<p>
And they get warm

when you see January Jones?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<p>
Is that how balls work?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
I don't know. It's a work in progress.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
Professional integrity!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<p>
"Our relationship no longer

has any professional integrity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
So it's gotta end. Stand to leave."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<p>
Shouldn't have read that part.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>
"When you reflect on this,

you'll see it's best for us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<p>
Exit restaurant." Goddamn it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
Wow, that was--

I don't know what that was.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<p>
Hey! Where are you going?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<p>
- Who gave you this idea? Spanakopita?

- This has nothing to do with Ana.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<p>
Here you go, sir.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<p>
- I'll get it!

- You two are b'thumping.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<p>
Now you do whatever she says?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
- Is that what's happening?

- No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
No, you're not b'thumping or no,

you're not doing whatever she says?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
- I'm not doing whatever she says.

- So you <i>are </i>b'thumping.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<p>
I understand from context what you mean,

but there's no way b'thumping is a thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
I'll get it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
You don't have to do everything

your little falafel pocket tells you to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
- You screwed up!

- Once! In 23 years!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
I'll get 'em.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<p>
All these years I carried you,

when no one wanted to work with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<p>
I still managed to get you jobs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
And then you would flake,

or sabotage them,

or get wrapped up in some crisis

or emergency or vague sadness.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<p>
Everyone told me to dump you--

my bosses, film execs, directors,

they all told me you were washed up,

a nobody, a has-been,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<p>
- a joke, too portly for TV.

- Too portly for TV? Who said that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<p>
- It doesn't matter.

- It does. Who said it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<p>
- Luis Guzman.

- Luis Guzman said I'm too portly for TV?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
You're right, BoJack.

This is for the best.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<p>
I no longer have to lug your talentless,

self-centered, self-sabotaging,

dead-weight carcass

of faded talent around my neck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<p>
- Hey.

- Thank you for firing me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
I'm gonna go pour myself

a little celebratory potato juice,

because this is the best goddamn

thing that's ever happened to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<p>
Hey! Hey! Hey!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<p>
Ha ha! I'll get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
You do not talk to me like that

and walk away.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
Oh, no? What's happening?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
This is so weird. I'm walking away,

even though you told me not to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
Right, I don't work for you anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<p>
- Hey!

- Excuse me, Mr. Horseman?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
- Not now.

- We have a slight problem in the kitchen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<p>
- Where is everybody?

- That's the problem. They all quit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
The kitchen's backed up with orders.

No one's getting food.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
And the critic is growing very impatient.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<p>
Writing that down...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
- Just do what you normally do.

- But there's no chef.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
Tonight's your lucky night.

You just got promoted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
But I don't want to be a chef.

<i>I want to sing</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
Kidding. I'm actually just happy

being a waiter. I'm not my job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
- A lot of people think that--

- You're the chef! Start cheffing!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<p>
What? Fifty teeth?

Get out of here. Let me see.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
Would you look at that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
You're thrilled

to have me out of your life?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
- I was such a burden all those years.

- Can I close my mouth now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
- Know what I think?

- Don't wanna hear it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<p>
You like being there to rescue me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<p>
- I close my mouth, okay?

- Nobody cares!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<p>
- Okay--

- Nope, I'm still counting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<p>
You like it when I'm a mess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<p>
Because it makes you feel good

about yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
Guess what? I never asked for that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
You ask all the time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
You have never not been asking me

to rescue you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
"Princess Carolyn, help me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
I slept with the gaffer's wife

and now he's not lighting me properly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn, I threw up

on Elle Fanning in a bounce house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn,

why am I such a big stupid asshole?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>
Okay, great, more abuse.

Right on schedule.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<p>
Oh, that's abuse?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<p>
"BoJack, you're such

a big, stupid asshole.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<p>
BoJack, why were you even

in the bounce house, dummy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<p>
BoJack, you wasted my thirties!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<p>
I never said you wasted my thirties.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
Didn't have to, you're always saying it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
And I don't like being around you,

because I feel bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
You make me feel bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
So this isn't about me being a bad agent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<p>
It's about a lot of things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
- Where are you going?

- Away.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<p>
Hey, listen, man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
I don't wanna get in the middle of this,

it's none of my business,

but I just have to say

I love that sweater.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<p>
- Can you give it to me?

- What? No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
I held my mouth open a really long time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<p>
- What does that have to do--?

- You're not being fair,

to me or Princess Katniss.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
- Who?

- Your friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
You've forgotten her already?

Typical BoSchwack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
That's enough out of you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<p>
It's all right,

you're gonna get through this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<p>
- You're gonna get through this.

- [woman] Are you okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<p>
Are you okay?

You've been in there a long time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<p>
[woman] I left for a while and came back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<p>
Just so you know,

this wasn't an easy decision.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<p>
- This is the ladies' room!

- [woman] What's going on out there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<p>
Are you watching a movie?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>
I agonized over this. Ask Ana.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<p>
- So you did talk about it with Ana.

- Yeah. I respect her opinion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
[shouts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
Paws not claws! Paws not claws!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<p>
God, you're strong.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
[BoJack groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<p>
This is exactly the kind of

unprofessionalism I'm talking about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<p>
- You want to talk about professionalism?

- Yes, I do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
But not here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<p>
You say you want professionalism?

Bullshit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<p>
You want a mommy

you can slide your dick in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<p>
I can want that

and also want professionalism.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<p>
A sex-mommy who keeps her boundaries,

is that too much to ask?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<p>
Is there a single woman

you've worked with

who you haven't tried

to groggily thrust yourself into?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<p>
Is it any wonder

I don't want to be around you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<p>
All you do is tell me

I'm a terrible person.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<p>
Please, you're such

a self-pitying masochist,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<p>
I could say ten nice things

and one mean thing,

you would only hear the one mean thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<p>
I'd love it

if you said ten nice things to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
- I can say nice things.

- Ready when you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<p>
Does self-pitying masochist count,

or are we starting from scratch?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
Okay, one-- I'm freezing my whiskers off.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<p>
- You have a natural charisma.

- You hesitated, that means it's a lie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<p>
Two, you are loved by millions.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<p>
That's not a compliment.

So is Kim Jong Un and Teri Hatcher.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<p>
I got this. I got this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<p>
Pre-heat oven?

Where's the pre-heat button?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<p>
Excuse me? Waiter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<p>
Where are my family's

double-fudge cheese pies?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<p>
I'm not your waiter anymore.

I'm the chef.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<p>
- Then who's our waiter?

- You're the waiter now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<p>
I can't be a waiter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
I have a very important

business meeting tomorrow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<p>
You get someone else to do it.

I'm the chef and whatever I say goes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<p>
Okay. Who gets these

soy balls and onion cubes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<p>
Table eight.

Deliver those soy balls, soldier.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<p>
You got it, boss.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<p>
Number six.

You know how to make me laugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
So I'm a clown to you?

Like Joe Pesci in <i>Home Alone?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<p>
[laughs] You recognize

you're being impossible, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
- I don't know how you put up with me.

- I didn't put up with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<p>
I liked being with you.

And I don't regret it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
Or the bracelet you bought me

for my 38th birthday.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<p>
Or when my dad died

and you came to the funeral

with me and held my hand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<p>
I'm doing this for both of us.

You understand?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<p>
- Did you ever love me? At all?

- I don't-- I'm not--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
You know that I don't do

the whole love thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
Either you end up hurting someone

or they hurt you. So, what's the point?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<p>
This sucks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<p>
I did this to myself. I do this to myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<p>
- Why do I do this to myself?

- I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<p>
Maybe if you're good at putting out fires,

you just run from fire to fire

and don't really think about--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<p>
[screams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<p>
Oh, God, I don't wanna be a chef!

I want to be not on fire!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:13" />

<p>
- We gotta put out that fire!

- I hate Mondays!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<p>
I figured out how to pre-heat the oven.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<p>
This night has been a disaster.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
The good news is I got my kid

to prep my important meeting at work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<p>
The bad news is

all the customers went home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<p>
They didn't like the screaming

and felt like their food

was a little too "on fire".

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
- It's called a char, dumbshits.

- The critic's still here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
Oh, oh, oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<p>
She still wants her mushroom risotto.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<p>
I don't know how to make risotto.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<p>
I know how.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<p>
What are you doing? No, go home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<p>
You're right. What am I doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
All right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<p>
Good luck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>

Goddamn it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<p>
How should I know?

Do I look like an expert in cooking oils?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<p>
We have to choose!

We're running out of time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<p>
- Olive. You wanna use olive oil.

- What are you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
Let me do this.

You'll burn the place to the ground.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
Fine. This isn't one of those things

where you save my ass

so I feel obligated to give you

your job back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<p>
I know you have no sense

of obligation to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
Ooh, slam. I'm sorry,

I'd rather not get involved.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
Can I get you some more water?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<p>
You look lovely. It's a great blouse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
Mom, I wanna go home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
This is a very important night

for the restaurant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
How are we coming on the sales meeting?

Did you get the big conference room?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<p>
Winslow wants the big conference room

for his presentation to corporate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<p>
You get back on that phone

and you get me that big room.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<p>
Okay, Mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
The secret is stirring continuously.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
Right, so that's the secret.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
I'm gonna go roll some more soy balls.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
- Thanks for your help.

- Sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<p>
How do you know how to do this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
Mom was a live-in maid for a rich family.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
She had a little trouble

bending her elbow too much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
Unless I wanted us to be on the street,

I had to cover for her, a lot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
That rich family loved Italian food

and champagne fountains.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
And cocaine. And private jets.

And screaming at each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
"Who threw my cocaine

in the champagne fountain?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<p>
- So standard rich people stuff?

- I guess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<p>
- How come you never told me that?

- I did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<p>
It's okay. I know

you never remember anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<p>
That's not true.

I remember the first time we met.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<p>
I went to see Marv. You were

at the desk in front of his office.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<p>
I thought you were cute and you said,

"It's good to see you again."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<p>
- So I guess we'd met before.

- That was the third time we met.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
The first time was when I was an intern.

I delivered a script to your house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<p>
You were passed out in the yard,

covered in tapioca pudding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
I hosed you down, dragged you inside,

covered you with a blanket.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
- Really? I don't remember that.

- Shocker.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<p>
So you've gone from daughter of a maid

to head of your own company.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
The company's not doing so hot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
- Don't try to guilt me.

- It's not your fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
Turns out being an agent and running

an agency are two different skills.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<p>
It's like asking a really delicious tomato

to make you a tomato sandwich.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
How's a tomato gonna make you

a sandwich? He's got no arms.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
You'll figure it out. Princess Carolyn

always lands on her feet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
But I don't even know why I'm doing it.

Does any of it matter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
Why are you an agent at all

if it makes you so miserable?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<p>
Because I'm good at it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.

But, usually, I'm really good at it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<p>
Just 'cause you're good at something

doesn't mean you have to do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
I'm good at driving sober,

but I don't relish the opportunity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
But what else would I do?

Who else would I be?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:09" />

<p>
I do love you, by the way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
I mean, as much

as I'm capable of loving anyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
Which is never enough. I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<p>
Ta-da!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
Well, it is truly...

how should I put this? Wonderful.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
So you'll give Elefante a good review?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<p>
No, I can't do that.

I waited over two hours to be served.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<p>
The ambience was terrible.

You two were screaming all night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
At one point, a waiter

ran through the restaurant on fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<p>
Unfortunately,

you will be receiving my lowest rating:

four hundred and twelve stars,

out of a possible a billion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
A billion stars?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
Yes, that's the rubric I use on

SamanthaGoesToRestaurants.tumblr.com.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<p>
Oh, God, get out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
I assure you the animated GIFs

with which I describe this encounter

shall be scathing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<p>
Mom! I just touched base

with Rooney, re: Winslow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
He's out, we're in.

The conference room is ours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<p>
Perfect! This is the meeting

where we finally convince the big boys

to let us get babies addicted to vaping!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<p>
Yes! Corporation!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
[all cheer]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<p>
- How about a drink?

- I could drink.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<p>
I don't think I can. I'm heading out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<p>
I got pretty badly burnt earlier

and in a lot of pain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
I should probably go to the ER.

Have a great night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
What's the second time we met?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
- A taping of <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

- Which episode?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<p>
The one where Olivia put too much

detergent in the washing machine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<p>
Oh, yeah.

Nancy Reagan was the guest star.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
That woman

was the real actor in the family.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<p>
I had just started working for Marv.

I went backstage to introduce myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<p>
And then what happened?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<p>
You told me you were too tired

pretending to be nice all night,

and to leave you alone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
I'm a real jerk, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<p>
Yeah, but you're honest,

straightforward,

not fake nice

and don't beat around the bush.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<p>
Your heart is tender,

so you protect it from people,

but sometimes you open up a wall

and it's incredible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
You're doing the best you can,

considering your asshole parents.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<p>
You have great taste in art,

and that pink spot

on your nose is just adorable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<p>
How many nice things was that,

about ten?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />

<p>
- Just about.

- Okay, one more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<p>
You let me help you tonight

because you knew I needed it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<p>
You did it for me,

which was very sweet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:44" />

<p>
Thanks. You're a good friend to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<p>
- BoJack...

- Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<p>
Are we friends?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
Yeah. I mean, I think we are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<p>
Or I think we can be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<p>
Okay, then as a friend, I'm asking you...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<p>
Please don't leave me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<p>
- Princess Carolyn--

- Please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<p>
I can turn this around,

I just need more time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<p>
We're in a fragile period,

still finding our feet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<p>
Just give me six months

and then you can go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:11" />

<p>
I promise,

I'll never ask anything from you again,

but please, give me six months.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:17" />

<p>
Sorry, I left my coat here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:19" />

<p>
[whistles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<p>
[waiter] I got it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:33" />

<p>
So? What do you think?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:37" />

<p>
No.
