<p>
{\an8}had the exact same premise

as my sitcom?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
Not the exact same.

<i>Mr. Peanutbutter's House </i>

featured a pair of twins,

Zoe and Zelda.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
<i>Zelda was the sunny,</i>

<i>fun-loving extrovert.</i>

My pumpkin's throwing up

because Halloween

encourages excessive consumption

of refined sugar

are sky high.

<p>
N-n-no?

<p>
{\an8}Yes, but the Zoe/Zelda

paradigm rang true.

<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
I believe everyone's

either a Zoe or a Zelda.

Emily's the Zoe.

not even listening.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
Yeah, well, you know what?

Maybe I would listen

if the Turbidians

had some reason

to enter

the Cave of Swollen Dreams

that didn't break the pact

they made in act one

with Queen Darneesa.

The Turbidians

are a loyal people.

betray their queen.

for Queen Darneesa,

who gave them a potion

that would counteract

the effects of

the Elixir of Failed Remembrance

so they could bring

the secret knowledge

from the cave back to her,

and then establish Newtopia

as a vassal state

to the Craterman kingdom!

Decapathon.

I was up for Dr. Decapitator

in the movie version.

They said they wanted

someone hipper,

but the part ended up

going to Robert Downey.

my girlfriend left me.

I didn't stop playing

threw me out of the house.

are not jokes,

<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
It's not your fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
I thought he was ready.

He seemed ready.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<p>
It's not... your... fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<p>
You're right.

In these heady times,

what Todd needs is an agent.

Ha! Ha!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
- I just need you to deliver...

- Hoo! Ha!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
- That third act showstopper...

- Ha!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<p>
...and then we'll be

fully financed!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<p>
Todd can do it!

Todd can do anything!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
- Can I get your autograph?

- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<p>
And another autograph,

and initial here, here,

here, and here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<p>
- Right here?

- And the last four digits

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<p>
- of your social.

- Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
So I think the big

third act number Virgil wants

might be a big anthem that--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

buddy, buddy,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<p>
I'm not gonna let you start

on this until we stock up

on snacks and Red Bull.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<p>
I do get snacky.

You think of everything.

'Scuse me, young man.

</p>

<p>
Can you hand me

that Ronnie Milsap cassingle

in the 10-cent bin?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<p>
Sure thing, lady.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<p>
Oh, my God.

Decapathon VII?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<p>
This just came out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
Todd, put it down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<p>
Is this really

only a dime?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<p>
If it's in there,

that's the price.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<p>
Todd, this is no time

for a relapse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<p>
Look, okay, I'll buy it now,

but I won't play it

till after I've written

the new song.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<p>
Todd, this is a bad idea!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
- Whoa!

- All sales are final.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
Okay, let's see here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<p>
I wonder if it still

smells the same.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<p>
I assure you,

it still smells

like cheap plastic

and child labor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<p>

Okay, here we go. Song time.

<p>

one game now,

just to get

the creative juices flowing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
We both know that if you

play that game tonight,

you'll never leave

this couch!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
Ah, no, you're right,

of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

- Good night.

It's the morning!

<p>
Damn it, Todd, the investor

showcase is in half an hour.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
- Did you work on the song?

- Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<p>
Pull yourself together, man!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
Ugh! Why did the water

have to come out of your mouth?

<p>
Well, I'm awfully sorry

to have wasted your time.

Hey, Van Cleef,

Todd may not be ready

for the high-flying world

of rock opera

or the larger world

outside of my living room couch,

but you know what?

He's a good friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
I don't see

how that's relevant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
No, of course you don't.

Maybe Todd's worse off today,

but you're worse off

in the long run,

because you're gonna die

alone and unloved,

you pompous,

affected asshole!

for a second chance.

Shut your mouth, Todd.

<p>

I actually convinced myself

</p>

<p>
I was more than

just a worthless screw-up.

you can keep all your stuff

What's really going on here?

</p>

Look, I've been following

you two around

for the last couple weeks,

and I think it's pretty obvious

to everyone that you shouldn't

be with Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<p>
You should be with me.
