<timestamp data-time="00:00:05" />

<p>
[jazz music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:09" />

<p>
I think, the most important thing here

is that we're honest with each other

and ourselves. Do you agree?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
Uh, yes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<p>
It says, here, you failed

your last six health inspections.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<p>
-Ooh.

-How are you still in business?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
I wanna say moxie?

But possibly spunk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
[chuckles] I can't believe

I fell asleep at your house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
-These shoots are messing up my rhythm.

-It's so weird waking up at 6:00 p.m.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
Don't worry. I'm not gonna make a habit

of spending the night or day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
I get it. We work together,

we make sex together,

we don't talk about feelings,

and yet sometimes

a begrudging respect can blossom into--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
-Nope.

-"Blossoms into nothing"

is what I was gonna say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<p>
You cut me off, so you look stupid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
Well, you look stupid when you sleep.

Look, I took some dumb pictures.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
-[BoJack] All right.

-Stupid. Real stupid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<p>
-[BoJack] You can delete some.

-You have a weird eye.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<p>
-Obsessed much?

-This is what it would look like

if corpses could drool. [laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
-Hi, excuse me, can I get <i>The BoJack?</i>

-What is that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<p>
It's an off-the-menu item

for those in the know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<p>
Obviously, I'm BoJack

and I always order the BoJack sandwich.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
That's kooky.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<p>
Why would your name be a sandwich name?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<p>
Because I own this restaurant

and I'm a celebrity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<p>
So, are all sandwiches named

after celebrities?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<p>
Is chicken salad a celebrity?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<p>
No, that's just a thing

they put in the sandwich.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<p>
That's not someone's name.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
Can't it be both? My name is Pickles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
-What?

-I'll have a burger.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<p>
BoJack, I'm going to the can.

Have fun with the waitress.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<p>
-[water running]

-[humming rhythmically]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<p>
-Um.

-It's me, Pickles, from before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<p>
-It's cool dating a celebrity.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:33" />

<p>
I'm also dating a celebrity.

Should we start a club?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<p>
-I call vice president.

-I'm not dating anyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<p>
And if I had to guess,

I'd say neither are you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<p>
Guys in this town, especially celebrities,

are not exactly the settle-down type.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<p>
That's why I hit the jackpot with my guy.

He doesn't have a problem committing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:47" />

<p>
In fact,

he just got out of his third marriage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<p>
A celebrity who just got divorced.

Yeah. No way he'll break your heart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<p>
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter and I

are moving too fast?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:57" />

<p>
I don't know you or your relationship,

but I have been around the block

a few times.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<p>
I was even on an ABC procedural,

called <i>The Block,</i> which aired a few times.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />

<p>
The key is to have zero expectations,

and then you'll never be disappointed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:09" />

<p>
Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<p>
Yeah, zero expectations,

which also seems to be the mantra

of this restaurant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:15" />

<p>
Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<p>
[theme music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<p>
She looks dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:14" />

<p>
But I'm not a doctor, I'm a sassy cop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<p>
Poor girl had dreams.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
And there's nothing more precious

than dreams.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:20" />

<p>
Philbert takes a drag of his cigarette,

then kneels down to inspect the corpse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<p>
-[Flip] Cut!

-[buzzer buzzes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<p>
{\an8}BoJack,

you said the stage directions again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<p>
{\an8}Sorry. My brain is kinda muddled.

It's these night shoots.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<p>
{\an8}I think it works.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<p>
{\an8}John Philbert doesn't play by the rules.

He says his stage directions out loud.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
{\an8}It's confusing, which means

the show is daring and smart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
{\an8}-Hey, wanna go check out craft services?

-Mm-mm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<p>
{\an8}How could whatever you're listening to

be more fun

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
{\an8}than hearing me rant

about the fruit spread?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
Is your rant honeydew related?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
It's in the honeydew area,

but the specifics are

what keep it fresh each time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
-[joyful music]

-[grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<p>
{\an8}-Are you ready to go?

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
{\an8}Sorry, I didn't realize how late it got.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
{\an8}If only there was an easy way

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
{\an8}to keep track

of what time it is right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<p>
{\an8}-I'll go change.

-No, keep your suit on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
{\an8}My parents are gonna be impressed

I'm dating an executive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
{\an8}Cool!

I've never impressed parents before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
{\an8}I believe that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
{\an8}Listen, I haven't told my family

I'm asexual,

so it might be best if, for tonight,

we just pretend we're sexually active.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
I mean, it's a family dinner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<p>
What are the odds they're going to ask

questions about our sexuality, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<p>
Right...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
[mystery music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<p>
Right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
Yeah...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
{\an8}-[Pickles] Hmm.

-Aha! Whoa. Slow down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<p>
{\an8}-Stop. We're here.

-Mr. Peanutbutter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<p>
{\an8}Am I Steve Carell taking a dramatic role

in <i>Little Miss Sunshine,</i>

and you are the American public

that only knows him for his comedic work?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<p>
Because... surprise!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<p>
Oh, my God. Are you the umlaut

in ChloÃ« Sevigny's name, right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
Because I don't know why you're here,

but I'm glad you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
As Courteney Cox said when she discovered

a rotting corpse in the woods

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<p>
{\an8}near the <i>Cougar Town </i>set,

"Good God, I hope you're not busy."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
{\an8}-What?

-This is a thinker.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<p>
-You'll get it later.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
I have a very fun plan for tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<p>
I just heard that they're going to blow up

the International Space Station.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
-Oh, my God. Blow it up? Why?

-No one knows why space people do things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
But I thought we could road trip

out to the desert

and witness the explosion

in all her glory.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<p>
That sounds amazing!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
I'm so glad you're as excited as I am,

and not mad at me

for trying to surprise you

with something nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<p>
Yeah! But... are we moving too fast?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
{\an8}A wise lady, in the bathroom,

told me some stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<p>
{\an8}-Ooh, she sounds smart. Better listen.

-I think her name was Hamburger.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
{\an8}Maybe we should wait, some days,

before going on another date.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
Okay. If that's how you feel,

you stay here and do nothing,

and I'll go have this amazing,

once-in-a-lifetime experience

all by myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<p>
It does sound cool.

I could also drive to the desert.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
If we're both going,

we might as well carpool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<p>
That's smart! But just to be clear,

we're slowing things down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
It's not a date.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<p>
[chuckles] Exactly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
Is this that mysterious,

brown hors d'oeuvre

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<p>
I ate at Mark McGrath's pool party,

last week?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
Because... oh, boy. Not a date.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<p>
[rhythmic music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<p>
...and finally, Carnegie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
Thus, concludes the two-item list

of acceptable melons.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
-[humming rhythmically]

-Always with the earbuds.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
What are you listening to?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<p>
-Hey! No... Ugh!

-[musical playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<p>
[laughs] What is this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
-This is so corny.

-It's not corny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
I mean,

it's technically a musical about corn,

but it's actually sophisticated.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
Wait a second.

Are you... into musicals?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<p>
I sense you'll make this a thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<p>
Well, well, well, the stone-hearted cynic,

who thinks feelings are for suckers,

has a secret soft spot for sappy musicals.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
-Okay.

-When you say, "Okay,"

do you mean okay like "correct,"

or okay like "OK-lahoma"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
-<i>âª Oklahoma âª</i>

-All right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
Step-ball-change, step-ball-change,

shuffle off to Buffalo, and big finish.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
-BoJack, watch out!

-Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<p>
-[Gina] Ah... oh, God.

-Ouch! God damn it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
Once again, my life has been worsened

by a brush with musical theater.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<p>
<i>âª Oh, yes, it's true</i>

<i>I'm feeling so romantic âª</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
Driver, can you put on

something less romantic?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
I have a podcast

about the space station explosion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
Oh, good idea!

Nothing is less romantic than learning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
<i>and this is the Crooshcast.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<p>
Oh. My ex-wife has a podcast.

This is probably weird for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<p>
No, it would only be weird

if we were on a date, but we're not, so...

Ew, back to the podcast.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
-Todd is the president of ad sales.

-Mm, look at you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
-And he went to a really good college.

-I did?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<p>
That's very impressive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
I'm afraid we don't know a lot

about the world of big business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<p>
As I'm sure Yolanda has told you,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<p>
I'm but a humble,

best-selling, erotic novelist

and my wife is a world-famous,

adult, film star,

and Yolanda's identical twin sister,

Mindy, is a sex advice columnist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
Wow! Yolanda told me all of that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<p>
That's all really great information,

that I was already privy to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
Well, the important thing is

that Yolanda is happy

and she's finally found a man, woman,

or object to have sex with.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
Todd is very accomplished

at sexual intercourse. Aren't you, Todd?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<p>
Yeah, I'm the best at the sex.

Hooba, hooba.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<p>
-Are you trying to say "hubba, hubba"?

-Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<p>
You know, Todd, I have a bit

of a reputation, myself. [moans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
-Whoa!

-Okay, we should be hitting the road.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<p>
Oh, but you must stay for erotic dessert.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<p>
You know, I saw the erotic dessert

in the kitchen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<p>
Who knew you could make

such a realistic anus out of marzipan?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<p>
You can thank my husband.

He posed for the baker.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
Wow, you know,

it really puts the "um" in "yum."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
I insist you spend the night

and make love in my home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<p>
-Uh...

-I can't think of a reason,

you wouldn't want to have sex

in your parents' house.

</p>

Unless, you don't enjoy sex.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
[sudden sounds]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<p>
No! Of course we'll spend the night,

and... fornicate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
[rhythmic music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
Hey, I got a suggestion for that scene

where you make your big confession.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<p>
-Oh, yeah?

-I was thinking you could maybe confess...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<p>
<i>âª ...in song! âª</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
-[grunts]

-Whoa, hey!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
-BoJack, shut up and get in here.

-Okay, look at that! Found an emotion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<p>
I'm gonna tell you

something very personal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<p>
When I was a little girl, my mom took me

to see <i>A Kernel of Truth</i> on Broadway.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<p>
It wasn't a big hit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
Yeah, I know. I Googled the reviews

so I could mock you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<p>
That Frank Rich could be

a real frank bitch, am I right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
Well, I was six and it blew my mind.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
I spent my childhood dreaming of, one day,

getting to sing on Broadway.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
So now I get steady TV work,

which is fine, and I'm fine,

but I still listen to that musical

because it reminds me of a time

when I was less jaded,

when I believed I could do anything,

and that makes me feel good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
Oh, my God, Gina.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<p>
I-I didn't realize how much

this musical meant to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<p>
-And that... that's even funnier!

-Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<p>
[laughs] Oh, come on!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
You know if this were reversed,

you'd be giving me shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<p>
Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
Hey, Gina, I'm sorry. I was just teasing.

I was... It was... [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
Gina, come out of the bathroom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
Gina? Oh, right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
[Laika] <i>So, he make for you</i>

<i>room, that you always have dream of,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
<i>and this is why you leave?</i>

<i>Seems like overreaction.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
[laughs] Oh, thank you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<p>
[Diane] <i>Okay, we're gonna take a break.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
I'm getting kinda hungry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<p>
We could stop at a restaurant,

but that's kind of a date thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
Well, fast food doesn't count, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
-Look, there's a KFC at the next exit.

-Perfect.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<p>
[piano music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
Welcome to KFC,

which stands for Kiki's French Cuisine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
-Hon hon hon!

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<p>
[both] Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
I'm not sure I want to wear the pajamas

your dad gave me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
I'm sorry you have to deal with all this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<p>
Is it just me

or was your sister flirting with me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
Ugh, when we were in high school,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<p>
I was still trying to figure out

my sexuality,

so, I dressed as Mindy,

and tried to seduce her boyfriend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
-Hmm.

-I quickly realized I wasn't into it,

but Mindy found out,

and now that I have a boyfriend,

she probably wants to have sex with you

to get revenge. Typical sister stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
I thought sisters were doing it

for themselves.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<p>
I mean, what does she need me for?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
-[knocking]

-Todd,

can you help me move some furniture?

My husband has a hernia.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
Yeah, no, I noticed in the marzipan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<p>
So, what, uh,

furniture do you want me to--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
-[sighs]

-Oh, no! Your garment fell.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<p>
This must be so embarrassing for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<p>
Just as I suspected.

You're not sexual at all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<p>
Like, heck I'm not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<p>
Any ordinary man would be madly aroused

by the body that starred in every single

porn version of a John Hughes movie:

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<p>
<i>Sixteen Cans, Titty in Pink,</i>

<i>The Breakfast Chub, Homo Bone...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
-I gotta go.

<i>-Cum Kind of Wonderful,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
<i>Penis Bueller Gets Off,</i>

<i>Planes, Trains and Autoerotic-mobiles.</i>

[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
[shouts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
When the cock crows midnight,

meet me under the old willow tree

in the backyard for sex.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<p>
-Zoinks!

-[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<p>
Okay, quick update.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
Mindy wants to meet me

for backyard sex at midnight,

and your mother knows I'm asexual.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
She showed me her boobs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
Please tell me you said, "Ahh-ooga!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
Oh, I didn't!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
Oh, no! She'll disown me!

We gotta convince her you're super horny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<p>
-How?

-If Mindy told my mom

that you made a pass at her,

that would prove you're not asexual.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<p>
Here's the plan.

We'll wait until the cock crows midnight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<p>
Who is this cock?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<p>
When she's at the backyard,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<p>
I'll sneak in her room

and wear her clothes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<p>
I'll pretend I'm Mindy

and tell my mother you made a pass at me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
Okay, this sounds a little complicated,

but I think I can handle

exactly this amount of complication

as long as things don't become

one bit more complicated.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<p>
-[musical playing over earbuds]

-Hey, I'm sorry I made fun of your dream.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<p>
[sighs] It's okay.

Just don't tell anyone about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>
Good news; too late.

I talked to Flip and Princess Carolyn

about how you're

into this Broadway crap...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
-What?

-...and they said maybe you can sing

in the nightclub episode.

Can you believe it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<p>
-Oh, my God.

-It's your big break, and I helped!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
I don't want help.

Why would you do that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
I know you don't want me

doing nice things

because I'm not your boyfriend,

and you're a sentient wall of spikes,

but they want to hear you sing

at the next break.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
Here's a song!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
<i>âª Hell, no! âª</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
Gina, this is your dream,

and there's nothing more precious

than dreams.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
It doesn't work that way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
You're used to being the star,

so good things always happen to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<p>
I'm not the star.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
I'm the third on the call sheet

for <i>Murder Hospital,</i>

or <i>Who Called the Monkey Paramedics.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<p>
And maybe if I'm lucky, when I'm 60,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<p>
I can get a<i> </i>juicy season arc

on the right cable show

where everyone goes,

"Who's this 60-year-old woman?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
She came out of nowhere."

Then I win an Emmy in a movie

where I play Benjamin Bratt's mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
Gina, I know, but what I'm saying is,

what if you are the star?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<p>
-I'm not.

-But what if you are?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
If you don't try, you'll never know.

You'll spend the rest of your life

wondering if you could have made it

or not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<p>
Is that what you want?

Always the Bratt's mom and never Da Brat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<p>
[scoffs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<p>
-Yeah?

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
-Just... so I don't have to wonder, right?

-Exactly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>
I'm gonna go get ready.

This is dumb, but thank you, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<p>
[both munching]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<p>
You know, this is actually really freeing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:38" />

<p>
I feel like, I can say all the things

I would never say on a date.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
Like that I've never seen<i> The Wire,</i>

and I don't think I'm gonna.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
Well, I'd never tell a date

that I get the <i>New York Times,</i>

but I only read the style section

and throw the rest away.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<p>
I don't have or want children,

but I silently judge every parent

that I see in public.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
I sleep with a chew toy,

since I was a kid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<p>
[chuckles]

I still have feelings for Diannnne.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<p>
Oh. That's much less fun

than the other things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<p>
Uh, listen--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<p>
Let's just finish our meal

and go see the explosion.

<p>
And I'm the cock.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<p>
[rhythmic sounds]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<p>
Here I come. [giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<p>

<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<p>
Ah! Mrs. Buenaventura!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<p>
I was trying to understand

how someone could be like you,

so I did a little research.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
Did you know a computer can do more

than just find porn?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<p>
I use my laptop to flatten pie dough.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<p>
This concept of asexuality intrigues me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<p>
I've grown tired of the whole world

thinking of me as a sex object.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<p>
For once in my life I would like to have

a close, intimate experience

that has nothing to do with sex.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<p>
-[shouts]

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<p>
Asexualize me

like one of your French girls, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
Gulp!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<p>
[rhythmic sounds]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
I can't believe he didn't show up.

Only makes me want him more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
Mom, are you there? It's me, Mindy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
You can tell

because I'm dressed like a slut, as usual.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
Mindy, come down here.

I have a question only you can answer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
Oh, okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<p>
If you really want to be asexual,

first, you have to put on

every piece of clothing you own.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<p>
That's how we make sure

we don't look sexy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<p>
So, leave me and go do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<p>
Very well, but I'll be back

to not have sex with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<p>
Ooh, I'm getting less excited

just thinking about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<p>
Hoo-hoo! Hooba, hooba.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<p>
Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<p>
-I need some advice, Mindy.

-That's me. I'm definitely Mindy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<p>
So you keep saying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<p>
Look, I'd like to give

your sister Yolanda this. [grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<p>
The last barrel

of your great grandmother's secret recipe

personal lubricant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
As you know, when a Buenaventura

is about to make love

for the first time in our home,

we always give them a barrel

of the family lube.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<p>
Uh, well...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<p>
Antique lube of this purity

is worth at least $100,000.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<p>
Ah-ooga!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<p>
[rhythmic sounds]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
Hello, baby, it's me,

your girlfriend Yolanda.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<p>
I came to ravage you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:17" />

<p>
There's something different about you,

but I can't put my finger on it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
Todd, take off your pants

and get in bed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<p>
Wait. What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
My dad is about to give us

very expensive lube

just for having sex in this house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<p>
And which sister are you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<p>
What the hell are you doing in here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
Todd, tell Mindy to get her ass

out of here, so we can get nasty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
<i>I'm </i>Yolanda.

Get away from my boyfriend!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<p>
Don't listen to her, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
I'm clearly Yolanda

because I'm dressed like a dumb loser.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
I'm so confused. I'm Todd, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
Maybe, this'll clear things up.

Mindy's the one who's about to die!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<p>
-[groaning, moaning]

-Oh, dear, I'm too late.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<p>
They're already having sex.

[sighs] They don't need the lube.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
[Yolanda] Ouch! That hurts!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
-Or maybe they do need the lube.

-[door opens]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<p>
Ha! Can't see me now, world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
Angelica, as I jizz and breathe,

what the hell are you wearing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<p>
-Oh, no! The lube!

-Oh, dear!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<p>
[Mr. Buenaventura] Oh!

That's too slippery!

</p>

-[Mrs. Buenaventura] Ah! Oh!

-[Yolanda] Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<p>
[Mindy] Oh, no! Our grandma's

sexily spinning in her grave.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<p>
Todd, you gotta save the lube!

Just plug the hole with your erect penis!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
What? No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
It's the only thing

that'll fit the hole perfectly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>
There has to be another way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<p>
Surely it's erect since you've been

just having sex with my daughter,

so unless you've been deceiving me,

this whole time, in my own home,

there's no logical reason, for you,

not to whip out your erect penis

and plug the damn hole!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<p>
Todd, the lube!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<p>
I'm gonna try my big toe.

That's the penis of the foot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<p>
[Yolanda] Oh, God, be careful!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
-[Todd] Whoa! Look out!

-[Yolanda] No! Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
[all shouting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<p>
-[Mindy] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

-[Mr. Buenaventura] I can't look!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<p>
[all] No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<p>
-[Mindy sighing]

-[Yolanda sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
[all shouting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
Before I start, just to give some context

because the song

doesn't make sense if...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
Okay, so, it's 1712,

and American colonist Sybilla Masters

is perfecting her invention.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<p>
Can we lose the liner notes

and get to the singing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<p>
I'm a producer. I can't just sit around

having conversations, all day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<p>
Oh, yeah, sorry. Of course.

Thank you. And I'm sorry. And...

[clears throat] I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<p>
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

That was weird.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<p>
You know what, she was nervous, and--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
BoJack, I don't know what kind

of power games you two are playing,

but keep it in the bedroom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<p>
That was just mean, to her and to us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
No. I thought she'd be good.

I was trying to do a nice thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<p>
And I would like to be judged solely

on my intentions this time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
[both shouting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
Interloper!

You ruined our family heirloom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<p>
Ah! I'm sorryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
-[both grunting]

-That's for trying to trick Todd

into having sex with you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
And that's for having sex

with my boyfriend in high school!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
I never had sex with him!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
Yes, you did!

The whole school knew about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
No, I didn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
I was going to, but I ran away

because I'm [shouting] asexuaaaaaaaaal!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<p>
[gasping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<p>
You know,

it felt good to finally tell them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
I was surprised

how cool they were with it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
Yeah, I kind of forgot

that despite our differences,

they're family and they love me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
So, I guess all that sneaking around

was completely pointless.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<p>
Hey, you're right!

What a silly waste of time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<p>
-Hey, can I ask you something?

-Of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<p>
Why did you tell your family

I went to college?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
Oh, I don't know, I guess

I just wanted you to seem impressive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<p>
-Impressive to who?

-Todd... [sighs] To whom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
-Yolanda, we need to break up.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<p>
The only thing we have in common

is that we're asexual.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<p>
I'm sure there's a guy out there for you,

whom's smart and accomplished

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<p>
-and whom went to college--

-And also doesn't want to have sex?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<p>
Yeah. Probably.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
-But what if there isn't?

-Well, then let's make a deal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<p>
How about if neither of us meet

anybody else by the time we're a hundred,

we give this another shot?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
When we're a hundred? I don't know.

Are you gonna steal my dentures

and use them to build

some sort of motorized nutcracker,

but then the nutcracker's AI

becomes self-aware

and leads all the other dentures

in the nursing home in a toothy revolt?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
-I wanna say no, but probably yes.

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<p>
Well, then, I guess I'll see you

when we're a hundred.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>

-[Pickles shivers]

-Come on, you're shivering.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<p>
-Please, just take the blanket.

-No, I'm okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<p>
Are you the type of war dramatized

in <i>The Hunt for Red October?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<p>
Because you're cold.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<p>
That one doesn't even make sense.

How do you hunt a month?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
I know that it was really hard

to hear what I said in the restaurant,

but... I want you to know

everything about me,

even the hard stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
I get it. This is a bad time for you

to start a relationship.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
[laughs] Of course it's a bad time!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<p>
I just signed divorce papers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
But I can't control

when I meet someone special.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<p>
So, what am I supposed to do, just pretend

I don't want to see you every night?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<p>
But what if I'm like the space station?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<p>
After a while, you get bored of me

and replace me with someone new.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<p>
Look, I don't know the future.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<p>
This could end in heartbreak

for both of us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
I mean, most relationships do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<p>
And if I'm honest,

it's not usually me that gets bored.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
But I'd like to see where it goes

because... I like you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<p>
[chuckles] And we have fun together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<p>
And every time we see each other,

I like you a little more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
Hmm. Hey, am I Taylor Swift's grudge

against Katy Perry, right now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<p>
Because even though it makes no sense,

I want to be held for a superlong time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:36" />

-Mmm.

-Hi.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
[stammers] Look, I'm sorry.

I thought--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<p>
Hey, from now on,

let's just stick to the original rules

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<p>
-and not get in each other's business.

-Yes, of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<p>
-[stammers] I'm sorry. I didn't even--

-For the record, you were right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<p>
If I didn't sing there,

I would have spent the rest of my life

not knowing

if I ever could have made it or not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:13" />

<p>
Now I know. So, good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<p>
You had a bad audition.

It doesn't mean that everything--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:17" />

<p>
I said it's fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
You did your good deed,

so, you can feel good about yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<p>
-Hmm.

-I'm going to bed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<p>
If you want to have sex with me, you can.

Otherwise, I'll see you in the morning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:27" />

<p>
O-Okay. Uh... Hmm.
