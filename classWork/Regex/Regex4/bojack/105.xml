<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
And I do not like

them apples, Deedee.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
Yo, Deedee, get me a beer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<line>
[Boston accent] Yeah,

make that two, Deedee.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<line>
Gary, Marty,

I just got home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<line>
Ooh, Princess Diane doesn't

want to get her brother a beer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
Hey, Ma, come look

what the Pats dragged in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<line>
[Boston accent] Oh, hello!

Look who decided to come home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<line>
Queen Deedee blesses us

with her presence.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
To what do I owe the honor?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<line>
Look, I'm just here

to offer my condolences.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<line>
Oh, sure, in and out,

like a Protestant on Christmas.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<line>
Why would you want

to stick around,

be with your family

in their time of need?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<line>
Come on, Ma.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<line>
Don't fight

while the game's on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<line>
It's bad Juju.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
It's the '86 World Series.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
They lose.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<line>
Ah, why'd you have to--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<line>
Oh, we're just a bunch

of savages, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<line>
We're not like your fancy

California friends.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<line>
Your George Clooney

and your California Raisins.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<line>
Oh, come off it, Ma.

She don't mean no harm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<line>
For five years

she didn't come home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<line>
Why don't you make like A-Rod

and blow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<line>
Well, this was clearly

a huge mistake.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<line>
Ah, don't go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<line>
Deedee, please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<line>
Why not?

Ma doesn't want me here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
Ma don't know

what she wants.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<line>
She wants you here.

We all do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<line>
Ain't that right, Marty?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<line>
Can't look up from the game.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<line>
Besides, we need your help

organizing all

the funeral stuff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
We didn't go to college.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<line>
We're not smart like you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<line>
Fine, I'll help.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
Is there a number

for me to call?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<line>
Yeah, try 1-800-The-Internet,

dummy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<line>
Jeez, do some legwork, Dee.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
And do it quick.

The ice is melting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<line>
Oh, my God.

Is that dad?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<line>
Did someone draw balls

on his forehead?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<line>
That was before

we knew he was dead.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
We just thought

he was wicked hung over.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

[laugh]

In your face, Dad!

</line>

In your face forever.

How can I help you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

Are you trying to cut me out

I'm your agent, damn it.

- You show me nothing--

- What do you want from me?

You have no right to barge

in here after five years

and judge us, Diane.

I'm just saying Marty

could lend a hand

instead of sitting on the couch

watching the game all day.

<line>
Ah, Deedee.

<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

You know very well

his leg's still sore

from the accident

at the quarry.

Yeah, he's got to rest up

a wide receiver for B.C.

Hey, BoJack, you ever meet

any Boston celebrities?

<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<line>
Well, one time

at Bristol Farms,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<line>
Ben Affleck and I did reach

for the same bunch of grapes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
Oh, he eats grapes

just like us?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<line>
Hey, Ma,

Ben Affleck eats grapes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<line>
[Ma] He don't eat grapes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<line>
BoJack said

he fed Affleck grapes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<line>
He was graping it up

with the Daredevil himself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
This is the greatest day

of my life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<line>
Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<line>
Hey, I don't suppose you boys

would have any interest

in maybe playing some

touch football later?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
Are you kidding?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<line>
Touch football

with a star like you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
That would be

mad wicked pisser.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<line>
Ooh, you know what else

we got to do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<line>
We got to watch

the Cryane video.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<line>
Ooh, that sounds good.

What's that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<line>
No, we don't need

to revisit that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
When Deedee was 16,

we made up a secret pen pal

for her named Leo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<line>
Guys, I really would rather

not discuss it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<line>
We all took turns

writing her letters,

pretending to be this sensitive

boy from Cambridge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
It was wicked messed up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<line>
"Oh, Diane, we're

two misunderstood souls.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<line>
Everyone else is a phony.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<line>
Yours forever, Leo."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<line>
What?

That is amazing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<line>
After six months of letters,

we hired a homeless guy

to pretend to be Leo

and take her

to the homecoming dance.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<line>
- Look at her.

- Watch, watch this part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<line>
Why don't we watch this

every day?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<line>
- Look at her face.

- Now that's a good prank.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<line>
I was humiliated.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<line>
Yeah, you wouldn't get it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<line>
It's a brothers thing,

right, brothers?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<line>
Whoo!

That's Cryane for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
What a pussy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<line>
You know,

it's nice that years later

we can all laugh about this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<line>
Yep, my therapist

thinks the same thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<line>
I'm gonna go meet

with the funeral director.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<line>
Any of you boys

want to come?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
Nah, I ain't so big

on funeral homes, Deedee.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<line>
All them dead bodies,

they give me the jeebies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
Yeah, Deedee,

why do we got to go?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<line>
Fine, none of you

have to go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<line>
I'll take care of everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<line>
Thank you, Diane.

We all really appreciate it.

<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<line>
Come on, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<line>
Why you got to take

BoJack with you?

<line>
- Boo!

- [bleats]

<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<line>
Boo!

</line>

stolen my heart

like Dave Roberts

stole second base.

<line>
[laughs] Hey!

He knows our things!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<line>
I must go now, but I'll see

you all at the funeral, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<line>
And when I do,

you're all getting noogies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<line>
- Funeral!

- Yeah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<line>
Whoo-hoo!

<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<line>
And now,

a very special treat

just for

our platinum members.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<line>
Let's take a peek

at the slumbering

<line>
Mr. Boreanaz himself.

<line>
[all] Ohh!

<line>
And thus concludes our tour.

[somber organ music]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<line>
Tell me about your father.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:32" />

<line>
Well, he was a mean,

sadistic alcoholic,

who never supported

anything I did

and actively delighted

in seeing me fail.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
Hmm, I see.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<line>
Sounds like you're looking for

our Piece of Shit Dad Package.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<line>
That would be too good

for my father.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<line>
Hmm, I see.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
Might I then suggest

our Piece of Shit Dad Package

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<line>
Would Be Too Good

For Him Package.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
Yeah, that's the one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<line>
Excellent choice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<line>
Hey, can I suggest

something?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<line>
You might want to loosen up

a little.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<line>
I think you could actually

learn a thing or two

from your brothers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
Are you kidding?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<line>
If I was like my brothers,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

My goons went to pick your

<line>
Hey, assholes!

Where were you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<line>
I planned the whole funeral,

like you asked me to,

and nobody showed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<line>
Yeah, we realized dad

wouldn't have wanted

some stuffy funeral.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<line>
He would've wanted his body

to be chopped up into chum

and thrown

in Derek Jeter's fat face.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<line>
Yeah, suck it, Jeter!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<line>
Wait, what?

Where is Dad?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<line>
We got him chummed.

He's in the truck.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<line>
[horn honks]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<line>
You chummed Dad?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<line>
It's what your father wanted,

honey,

but then you wouldn't know

anything about that, would you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<line>
Let me get this straight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<line>
So instead of coming

to the funeral

that I paid for

and spent all day organizing,

you had Dad's body

ground into chum,

so you could throw his mushy

remains on Derek Jeter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<line>
No, not just on Derek Jeter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<line>
We're gonna throw it

into his fat face.

Too good for her home.

<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<line>
Yeah, guys,

you got it all wrong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<line>
Diane isn't a big-shot.

She's my ghostwriter.

<line>
She's writing a book that's not

even gonna have her name on it.

<line>
You think this

is how she expected

her life would be going at 34?

She lives with her rich

boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.

<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
Oh, don't go, BoJack.

<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<line>
Yeah, don't leave, bro.

Hey, sorry I said

all that stuff about you.

<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<line>
It's all true, isn't it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<line>
I found this letter

back at the bar.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
I think it's for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<line>
Look, just read it.

I think you'll like it.

<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<line>
"Dear Diane, it's me,

your old pen pal Leo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

"You're a good person,

Diane,

the most important thing.

Even if no one

it's important that

you don't stop being good.

Look, take it from someone

with his own shitty parents,

family is a sinkhole,

and you were right to get out

when you had the chance.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<line>
The stupid thing is,

even now I still just want them

to be proud of me

and think I did good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<line>
Is that really stupid?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<line>
- Yep.

- No, it isn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<line>
Yeah, it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<line>
You want those guys

to be proud of you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<line>
I guess I was just hoping to

get some modicum of closure.

</line>

<line>
Closure is a made up thing

by Steven Spielberg

to sell movie tickets.

</line>

<line>
It, like true love

and the Munich Olympics,

doesn't exist

in the real world.

</line>

<line>
The only thing to do now

is just to keep living forward.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
Yeah, but every time

I come back here they--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<line>
So don't come back here.

- [beep]

<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<line>
Hey, Herb, look,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<line>
I think we have some

unfinished business.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<line>
It seems like life's too short

to hold grudges

and stuff like that,

you know what I'm saying?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<line>
About life being too short?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<line>
Well, of course

you know what I'm saying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<line>
You're the one

with terminal--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<line>
I feel like I'm doing

all the talking here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<line>
So anyway, I thought

maybe we could chat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<line>
Why don't you give me

a call, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<line>
Um... so smell you later?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<line>
This is BoJack.

Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<line>
Obviously.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<line>
Ugh, who keeps calling me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<line>
Come on, BoJack.

Pick up, pick up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<line>
I'm sure he'll pick up.

</line>
