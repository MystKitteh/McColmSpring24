<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
And I do not like

them apples, Deedee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<p>
Yo, Deedee, get me a beer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
[Boston accent] Yeah,

make that two, Deedee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<p>
Gary, Marty,

I just got home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
Ooh, Princess Diane doesn't

want to get her brother a beer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<p>
Hey, Ma, come look

what the Pats dragged in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<p>
[Boston accent] Oh, hello!

Look who decided to come home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<p>
Queen Deedee blesses us

with her presence.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<p>
To what do I owe the honor?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<p>
Look, I'm just here

to offer my condolences.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
Oh, sure, in and out,

like a Protestant on Christmas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
Why would you want

to stick around,

be with your family

in their time of need?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<p>
Come on, Ma.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<p>
Don't fight

while the game's on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
It's bad Juju.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
It's the '86 World Series.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<p>
They lose.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<p>
Ah, why'd you have to--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
Oh, we're just a bunch

of savages, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<p>
We're not like your fancy

California friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<p>
Your George Clooney

and your California Raisins.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
Oh, come off it, Ma.

She don't mean no harm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<p>
For five years

she didn't come home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<p>
Why don't you make like A-Rod

and blow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
Well, this was clearly

a huge mistake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<p>
Ah, don't go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
Deedee, please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<p>
Why not?

Ma doesn't want me here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
Ma don't know

what she wants.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
She wants you here.

We all do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<p>
Ain't that right, Marty?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
Can't look up from the game.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
Besides, we need your help

organizing all

the funeral stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<p>
We didn't go to college.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<p>
We're not smart like you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
Fine, I'll help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<p>
Is there a number

for me to call?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
Yeah, try 1-800-The-Internet,

dummy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
Jeez, do some legwork, Dee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
And do it quick.

The ice is melting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
Oh, my God.

Is that dad?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
Did someone draw balls

on his forehead?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
That was before

we knew he was dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
We just thought

he was wicked hung over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<p>
[laugh]

In your face, Dad!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
In your face forever.

<p>
How can I help you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
Are you trying to cut me out

<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
I'm your agent, damn it.

- You show me nothing--

- What do you want from me?

<p>
You have no right to barge

in here after five years

and judge us, Diane.

</p>

<p>
I'm just saying Marty

could lend a hand

instead of sitting on the couch

watching the game all day.

<p>
Ah, Deedee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

You know very well

his leg's still sore

from the accident

at the quarry.

Yeah, he's got to rest up

a wide receiver for B.C.

Hey, BoJack, you ever meet

any Boston celebrities?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
Well, one time

at Bristol Farms,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
Ben Affleck and I did reach

for the same bunch of grapes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<p>
Oh, he eats grapes

just like us?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<p>
Hey, Ma,

Ben Affleck eats grapes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
[Ma] He don't eat grapes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
BoJack said

he fed Affleck grapes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
He was graping it up

with the Daredevil himself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
This is the greatest day

of my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<p>
Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<p>
Hey, I don't suppose you boys

would have any interest

in maybe playing some

touch football later?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
Are you kidding?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
Touch football

with a star like you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
That would be

mad wicked pisser.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
Ooh, you know what else

we got to do?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<p>
We got to watch

the Cryane video.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
Ooh, that sounds good.

What's that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
No, we don't need

to revisit that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
When Deedee was 16,

we made up a secret pen pal

for her named Leo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
Guys, I really would rather

not discuss it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<p>
We all took turns

writing her letters,

pretending to be this sensitive

boy from Cambridge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<p>
It was wicked messed up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
"Oh, Diane, we're

two misunderstood souls.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
Everyone else is a phony.

<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
Yours forever, Leo."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<p>
What?

That is amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<p>
After six months of letters,

we hired a homeless guy

to pretend to be Leo

and take her

to the homecoming dance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<p>
- Look at her.

- Watch, watch this part.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<p>
Why don't we watch this

every day?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
- Look at her face.

- Now that's a good prank.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<p>
I was humiliated.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<p>
Yeah, you wouldn't get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<p>
It's a brothers thing,

right, brothers?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
Whoo!

That's Cryane for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
What a pussy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
You know,

it's nice that years later

we can all laugh about this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<p>
Yep, my therapist

thinks the same thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<p>
I'm gonna go meet

with the funeral director.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
Any of you boys

want to come?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
Nah, I ain't so big

on funeral homes, Deedee.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
All them dead bodies,

they give me the jeebies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
Yeah, Deedee,

why do we got to go?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
Fine, none of you

have to go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<p>
I'll take care of everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
Thank you, Diane.

We all really appreciate it.

<p>
Come on, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<p>
Why you got to take

BoJack with you?

<p>
- Boo!

- [bleats]

<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<p>
Boo!

</p>

stolen my heart

like Dave Roberts

stole second base.

<p>
[laughs] Hey!

He knows our things!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<p>
I must go now, but I'll see

you all at the funeral, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
And when I do,

you're all getting noogies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<p>
- Funeral!

- Yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
Whoo-hoo!

<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
And now,

a very special treat

just for

our platinum members.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
Let's take a peek

at the slumbering

<p>
Mr. Boreanaz himself.

<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<p>
[all] Ohh!

</p>

<p>
And thus concludes our tour.

</p>

[somber organ music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<p>
Tell me about your father.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:32" />

<p>
Well, he was a mean,

sadistic alcoholic,

who never supported

anything I did

and actively delighted

in seeing me fail.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
Hmm, I see.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
Sounds like you're looking for

our Piece of Shit Dad Package.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
That would be too good

for my father.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
Hmm, I see.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
Might I then suggest

our Piece of Shit Dad Package

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<p>
Would Be Too Good

For Him Package.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
Yeah, that's the one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<p>
Excellent choice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<p>
Hey, can I suggest

something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
You might want to loosen up

a little.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<p>
I think you could actually

learn a thing or two

from your brothers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<p>
Are you kidding?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<p>
If I was like my brothers,

<p>
Oh, they'd just love that,

wouldn't they?

<p>
Ugh, how are we supposed

to blackmail him

if we can't reach him?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<p>
Maybe we got to get him

where he lives?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
You mean--?

</p>

<p>
That's right,

Is that David Boreanaz?

<p>
I don't know,

Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
I ran out of shoeboxes

for the money,

and the books

aren't adding up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<p>
Plus the men's lav

needs to be serviced,

and I had to fire Janine

in the gift shop

for stealing Boreabble heads.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
I mean, how did I end up

with all this responsibility?

Ow!

It's 4:00.

<p>
My goons went to pick your

father up, but nobody was home.

<p>
For a nominal fee,

we can scrounge up

another body for you.

<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<p>
Hey, assholes!

Where were you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<p>
I planned the whole funeral,

like you asked me to,

and nobody showed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
Yeah, we realized dad

wouldn't have wanted

some stuffy funeral.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
He would've wanted his body

to be chopped up into chum

and thrown

in Derek Jeter's fat face.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<p>
Yeah, suck it, Jeter!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<p>
Wait, what?

Where is Dad?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
We got him chummed.

He's in the truck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
[horn honks]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<p>
You chummed Dad?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<p>
It's what your father wanted,

honey,

but then you wouldn't know

anything about that, would you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
Let me get this straight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<p>
So instead of coming

to the funeral

that I paid for

and spent all day organizing,

you had Dad's body

ground into chum,

so you could throw his mushy

remains on Derek Jeter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<p>
No, not just on Derek Jeter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
We're gonna throw it

into his fat face.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

- Yeah, his fat face.

- In his fat face.

Why does everything always

got to be about big-shot Diane?

<p>
Too good for her home.

<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
I don't think

I'm too good for my home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<p>
Yeah, guys,

you got it all wrong.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<p>
Diane isn't a big-shot.

She's my ghostwriter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<p>
She's writing a book that's not

even gonna have her name on it.

</p>

<p>
You think this

is how she expected

her life would be going at 34?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<p>
She lives with her rich

boyfriend and doesn't pay rent.

for anything.

Diane, you are making

a public spectacle of yourself.

Deedee, what are you doing

with Dad's keys?

</p>

<p>

<p>
I don't know,

Diane was pretty upset,

and she's got your dad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<p>
Oh, don't go, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
You're like the fifth brother

I never had.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
Yeah, don't leave, bro.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

we'll go play touch football

<p>
Um, would you

like a Boreabble head?

the house looks

<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
[Diane] <i>Not good.</i>

it was a waste of time

to come back here.

<p>
Oh, that's awful.

<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

Well, when you get back,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<p>
I'll give you one of

my patented Peanutbutter hugs.

<p>
Crunchy and creamy.

<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
You know

that patent wasn't approved,

but I'll take it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
I have to go.

BoJack's here.

<p>
<i>BoJack, well,</i>

<i>what's he doing--?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
Hey, sorry I said

all that stuff about you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
It's all true, isn't it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
I found this letter

back at the bar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
I think it's for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<p>
Look, just read it.

I think you'll like it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<p>
"Dear Diane, it's me,

your old pen pal Leo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<p>
This definitely isn't

BoJack Horseman writing this."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
Keep reading.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
"You're a good person,

Diane,

and that's

the most important thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
Even if no one

appreciates you,

it's important that

you don't stop being good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
I like how you always

bring your own bags

to the grocery store,

and how you're always

organized to go places.

<p>
I like how you chew gum on the

That's the best letter

he ever wrote me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
Look, take it from someone

with his own shitty parents,

family is a sinkhole,

and you were right to get out

when you had the chance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
The stupid thing is,

even now I still just want them

to be proud of me

and think I did good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<p>
Is that really stupid?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
- Yep.

- No, it isn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
Yeah, it is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<p>
You want those guys

to be proud of you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<p>
I guess I was just hoping to

get some modicum of closure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
Closure is a made up thing

by Steven Spielberg

to sell movie tickets.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<p>
It, like true love

and the Munich Olympics,

doesn't exist

in the real world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
The only thing to do now

is just to keep living forward.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<p>
Yeah, but every time

I come back here they--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
So don't come back here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<i>- It's Herb. You know what to do.</i>

- [beep]

<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
Hey, Herb, look,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<p>
I think we have some

unfinished business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<p>
It seems like life's too short

to hold grudges

and stuff like that,

you know what I'm saying?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<p>
About life being too short?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
Well, of course

you know what I'm saying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<p>
You're the one

with terminal--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
I feel like I'm doing

all the talking here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<p>
So anyway, I thought

maybe we could chat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
Why don't you give me

a call, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
Um... so smell you later?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
This is BoJack.

Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<p>
Obviously.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

[phone buzzes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
Ugh, who keeps calling me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<p>
Come on, BoJack.

Pick up, pick up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<p>
I'm sure he'll pick up.

</p>
