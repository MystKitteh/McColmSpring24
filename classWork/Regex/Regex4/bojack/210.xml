[snoring]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
Aw, she looks so peaceful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<line>
Think she's dreaming that

she's not overstaying her welcome?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<line>
When she got that wine delivered

to the house,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<line>
I thought that was her thank-you present,

that she was leaving,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<line>
-but then she just drank the wine.

-Five days ago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<line>
-Morning, everybody.

-Aah! Kinko!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<line>
Another beautiful day

in the city of Brotherly Angels.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<line>
Todd, I don't recall

accidentally ingesting poison,

and yet here you are

trying to make me vomit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<line>
You wanna go buy me a kite

and then fly a kite?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<line>
No. Kites are sky trash.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<line>
[groans]

Why is it so daytime right now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<line>
Wanda?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
[groaning]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<line>
Wanna go surf some cloud waves?

That's what I call wind.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<line>
Sorry. Some of us have jobs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<line>
Not all of us. Just some of us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<line>
Oh, yeah, my job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<line>
-Morning.

-[J.D.] What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<line>
I'm done with my sabbatical

and I'm ready to get back to work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<line>
What sabbatical? I fired you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<line>
Oh, I thought

when you said, "You're fired,"

that was just you

"giving me the business."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<line>
No, I was taking the "business"

away from you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<line>
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

You wanna go fly a kite?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<line>
Put me down

for a supersized "sounds great."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<line>
But with an even larger main course

of "sadly, I cannot."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:26" />

<line>
I am swamped here at work.

First, I gotta put my suit on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<line>
Then I gotta go to hair and makeup.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<line>
Then we record the show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<line>
And then I gotta take my suit off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<line>
So, that's, like, the whole day. Sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<line>
Ah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<line>
"Looking for a friend?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:46" />

<line>
Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:47" />

<line>
"Need direction?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:48" />

<line>
I'm listening.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<line>
{\an8}"Try Scientology"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<line>
-Huh.

-Excuse me? Sir?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<line>
-Huh?

-Have you ever thought

about trying improv comedy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:58" />

<line>
Improv comedy? I don't know...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<line>
Why not?

It's not like there's anything else to do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />

<line>
Here on Mars.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<line>
We're on Mars?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<line>
Yes. And in a Martian ice cream shop.

Care for a butterscotch swirl?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:12" />

<line>
Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<line>
The only limit is my imagination.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<line>
Why not come by our theater

and try a free class?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:19" />

<line>
Okay!

Can I bring this food inside the theater?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:23" />

<line>
Ha, good one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:24" />

<line>
-But no.

-Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:27" />

<line>
{\an8}[♪♪]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<line>
{\an8}"That's when I learned

that guns can blow a <i>vato </i>away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<line>
{\an8}But calculus?

Calculus can blow a mind away."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<line>
[Abe] Cut!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<line>
We got it!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<line>
{\an8}That's the day, everybody.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<line>
{\an8}[slurping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<line>
-You sure we got it, Abe?

-Of course. You were phenomenal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<line>
Really? Because that kid sneezed

in the middle of my monologue.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<line>
{\an8}-We can fix that in post.

-Abe, I'm supposed to tell you

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<line>
{\an8}the boom mike fell into the last shot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<line>
You sure you don't wanna get another take?

Just for safety?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
{\an8}What am I, Kubrick?

We can fix all this stuff in post.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
{\an8}It's an easy scene.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<line>
{\an8}Secretariat's a nice guy,

the Spanish kids learn a lesson.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<line>
{\an8}Boom. Bam! Done!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
{\an8}But Secretariat never actually taught math

in South Central.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
{\an8}I don't know what Secretariat did

or didn't do. I wasn't there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<line>
{\an8}-Yeah, but--

-Okay, so the studio wants gangbangers,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
{\an8}we'll give them gangbangers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
{\an8}-We get paid either way, right?

-I guess.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
{\an8}I can't wait to get home.

I got a coq au vin in the slow cooker.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<line>
{\an8}You like coq au vin?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<line>
{\an8}I think so. Is that the move

where a French girl pours soup in--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
{\an8}Come over for dinner, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<line>
{\an8}-You'll love it.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
{\an8}Chin up, big guy.

So, we ain't making <i>Casablanca.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<line>
{\an8}[slurping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<line>
{\an8}-BoJack. Shut up.

-Aah! What are you--?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
{\an8}No one can know I'm here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<line>
{\an8}-What?

-Shut your stupid mouth, you idiot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<line>
{\an8}As you know, you're my favorite client.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
{\an8}If I left Vigor,

would you follow me to a new agency?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
{\an8}Sure, but no one's gonna hire me

after this movie comes out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
{\an8}The script turned into a piece of shit,

and the director is a total hack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
{\an8}Good guy, total hack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<line>
{\an8}Let's get you something

before the movie comes out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<line>
{\an8}We got an offer in for this new play

off-Broadway.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<line>
Theater? That's what real actors do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
Yeah, I told them that,

but they said she wanted you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<line>
-She?

-Yeah, this hot new playwright Jill Pill.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
-She came out of nowhere.

-Jill Pill?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<line>
<i>New York Magazine </i>called her

the <i>enfant terrible</i>

of the immersive theater world,

and then later clarified

that that's a compliment.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
It sounds like the kind of thing

I should be doing now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
-Something artistic and bold.

-Rehearsals start in two weeks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<line>
Are you ready to go to New York

for six months?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<line>
New York's a great city to live in

for six months

and not a second longer and only

if you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<line>
Now, that's a lot of apple sauce.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
[all] Apple sauce!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<line>
Oh-ho!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
That was so funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<line>
Which one of you guys

wrote all those funny jokes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<line>
No, Todd, here at Shenanigags,

we make things up on the spot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
-Let's try it. Give me a suggestion.

-Uh... I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<line>
Suggestions?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
[all laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
Your suggestion was "suggestions."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
-Way to break the fourth wall.

-That wasn't that funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
My name's Bryan

and you haven't won me over yet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
-Oh, Bryan.

-Todd, in improv,

we get suggestions from an audience

then make up scenes based on them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<line>
There are just a few simple rules.

You don't ask questions. You don't say no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<line>
No matter what. When someone makes a

suggestion, you always try to build on it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<line>
We call that "yes, and..."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<line>
Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.

It's all part of the fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<line>
Is it really that simple?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
Ugh! It's incredibly complicated

and requires years of training.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<line>
Oh, Bryan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<line>
[all laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<line>
But improv isn't just about a constant

clamoring for attention and validation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<line>
It's about community.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<line>
I've always wanted to be part

of a community.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<line>
Well, you are now.

Your first class is $200.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<line>
I thought you said it was free.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<line>
Oh, that was just me doing an improv.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<line>
I am so proud of you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<line>
Every day I'm telling people all about

the great stuff you're doing there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<line>
-Yeah, I don't know--

-<i>And they say, "Wow, she sounds amazing."</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<line>
And I say, "I'm here to confirm

she is an incredible woman."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<line>
-<i>Well--</i>

-You know, the sound guy's wife

works with at-risk teens.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<line>
And I was like, "Yeah, that's okay,

but compared to what my wife is doing,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<line>
-your wife is bullshit!"

-<i>Oh.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
And he had to agree with me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
-Um--

-Because I am his boss.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<line>
-Listen--

-<i>Let me talk to one of the locals.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<line>
I wanna hear someone else talk

about how what a selfless hero my wife is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
-Oh, uh...

-Ah, now come on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<line>
-Most refugees got their tongues cut out.

-Find one with a tongue.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<line>
-<i>I don't think--</i>

-Indulge me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
[in softer voice]

Hello. I am refugee from village.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<line>
Hey, what's your name, Superstar?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
Uh, my name is...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<line>
Coffee Maker.

[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<line>
Ah. Kofi Makir.

Am I pronouncing that right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
Hey, Todd, you had some killer provs

in class today.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
Yes, and that zombie dentist scene

was so innovative.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
Eh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<line>
-Oh, Bryan.

-Guys, look.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<line>
It's Copernicus.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<line>
[all gasp]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
-Who's that?

-What are you, new?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<line>
Yes, I am new.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<line>
Copernicus is the founder of Shenanigags.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<line>
That guy is the Jan-Ove Waldner

of modern improv.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<line>
-Who is Jan-Ove Waldner?

-The Michael Jordan of table tennis.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<line>
-Let's go talk to him.

-Are you kidding?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<line>
You can't just go up and talk

to Copernicus.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
Man, Todd, you don't know shit.

You're just a tourist.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<line>
No, I'm not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<line>
If you're one of us, prove it.

Go improv that lady over there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
Freestyle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<line>
No audience, no net.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<line>
-I don't know...

-Hey, if you're down with the prov,

you gotta prove that prov.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
All right. I'll do it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<line>
-Hello, old ma'am.

-Oh, hello.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<line>
I'm just waiting for my friend Doris.

Have you seen her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<line>
Yes,

and she exploded?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<line>
Doris exploded?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<line>
-You just got prov'd!

-In your face, lady!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<line>
The streets are ours!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<line>
-Hurray, improv! I did it!

-You have briefly won me over.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
Poor Doris...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
That is not what I thought coq au vin was.

But it's great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
Well, I'm no Emeril Lagasse,

but we do get by.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
-Oh, stop. [laughs]

-Bam!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
Like Emeril? Ha, remember that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
He said "bam."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<line>
I don't know who Emeril is,

but he sounds delightful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
Hey, should I give him a sitcom?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<line>
BoJack, Abe tells me

you guys are almost done with the movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<line>
One week left!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<line>
You two lovebirds gonna do

any traveling or anything?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<line>
I'll be traveling back and forth

to New York for the next few months

because BoJack's doing a play there

after you finish.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
-Oh, I love plays.

-A play.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<line>
That's my favorite place

to eat crinkly candies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<line>
Yeah, I can't wait to finally work

on something good, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<line>
Oh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
Although I gotta hand it to your husband.

It has been a really painless shoot,

even though the movie's gonna be

a piece of shit, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
-What?

-Oh, you said "piece of ship," right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
Like shipshape? [giggles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
Anyway, what were we talking about?

Who knows?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<line>
-Okay, moving on.

-Hey, it's fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<line>
Abe knows what we're making.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
Right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<line>
[Abe slurps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<line>
-Wanda, would you help me with dessert?

-Uh, okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<line>
Yeah.

New York is so great in the summer,

but I don't think

we're going to be done in time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<line>
We're looking at a ton of reshoots.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<line>
-Are you kidding?

-Well, you know,

because the movie's such a piece of shit

and all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:16" />

<line>
Did that hurt your feelings?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<line>
I mean, you're the one who said

we're not making <i>Casablanca.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<line>
Right, because <i>Casablanca </i>is a movie

about a club owner named Rick.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<line>
This movie's about Secretariat,

a racehorse.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<line>
Wait, you literally meant we're not making

the actual movie <i>Casablanca?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<line>
That movie already exists.

Why would we make <i>Casablanca?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
-This is a different movie.

-I think there was a misunderstanding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<line>
Wrong, boy-o.

There was a mister-understanding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<line>
And that mister is me

understanding you just fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<line>
You come into my home

and you call my work shit?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<line>
-You know what I think? You're shit.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<line>
You think I don't get enough takes?

I'll get more takes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<line>
Just wait, see how many takes I can get.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<line>
Well, don't go.

We haven't had dessert yet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<line>
Shirley's lemon meringue? Mwah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<line>
I mean, it's no banana cream pie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<line>
Because it's a different kind of pie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
[slurs] That's right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<line>
Why did you have to antagonize him?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
I wasn't trying to antagonize him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
-He said, "It's no <i>Casablanca."</i>

-Well, what's done is done.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
You're happy.

You didn't want me to go to New York.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<line>
Lucky me, I get to stay here

and work on this movie

that's gonna ruin my career.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>
There's no reason to sulk about it, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
Or you could sulk about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
Diane does raise some good points.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<line>
No, she doesn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<line>
Besides, I don't think Diane's the person

you wanna be going to for life advice now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<line>
Why? Just because I've been drinking

myself to sleep on your deck chairs

and lying to my husband for the last week?

Hey, there's a Cheez-It on the shelf.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
I knew I kept these things around

for a reason.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<line>
-I just had the most amazing prov sesh.

-No one cares, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<line>
Hey, you guys wanna help me practice?

Make a suggestion.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<line>
-Stop.

-Aah. Sorry, officer,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<line>
I didn't see that stop sign.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<line>
And my car runs on farts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<line>
-[Todd mimics farting]

-[Wanda] Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
-Stop. No, stop it.

-Please stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<line>
Not a suggestion.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<line>
[mimics farting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
Okay.

I just hope I impress the elder council.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<line>
I want to become a Level Two,

so I can finally achieve clarity

on the Mainstage with the chosen ones.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<line>
Oh, shit, Todd's in a cult.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
What? No, improv is not a cult.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
It's just a dogmatic school of thought

taught by a for-profit organization

with the promise of social

and professional opportunities.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<line>
-Ahh.

-It's a cult. And I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
I learned a little about cults

during that year I was a Scientologist.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<line>
Coincidentally during that year,

I read a book about cults.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<line>
Wait, are you saying

Scientology is a cult?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<line>
No, Scientology is not a cult.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<line>
Improv is a cult.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<line>
I wanna be very clear.

This is about improv.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<line>
-I really don't think it's that bad, guys.

-Why does anything matter, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<line>
Love is an illusion,

and happiness is fleeting,

no such thing as God, and all your

favorite musicians beat their wives.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
Allegedly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<line>
Would you talk to her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
[sighs] Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<line>
Yes, and I am a Nazi Kardashian.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
Heyyy... Hitler.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<line>
Please stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<line>
[panting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<line>
President Lohan!

Get away from that fire hose!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<line>
[all] Fire hose!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
[grunts] Sorry I'm late, guys!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
Todd, we take tardiness seriously here

at Shenanigags.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<line>
-If you miss one more class, you're out.

-I'm sorry. But, wait, Bryan isn't here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
-He's later than I am.

-Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<line>
He's been negative, so Copernicus thought

he could benefit from some time away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<line>
He's been reassigned to the Shenanigags

comedy cruise line, the <i>Giggleship.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<line>
-Is that a reward or a punishment?

-That's up to Bryan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<line>
Let's have no more questions

about the <i>Giggleship.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<line>
Oh, uh, all right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<line>
Well, you know,

I was actually talking to my best friend,

and he said improv is a cult.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<line>
I mean, that's crazy, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<line>
[all laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<line>
[coughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<line>
If you think Shenanigags is a cult,

you're free to go, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<line>
Oh, no. I don't wanna go.

I love this place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<line>
My friend just doesn't know

how great you guys are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<line>
It sounds like your friend's

not yes-and'ing you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<line>
Invite him to your graduation show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<line>
If he's too negative to support you,

you should take a good hard think

about if that's the kind of energy

you want in your life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<line>
[groans] I hate good hard thinks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<line>
I love you, too, Mr. Peanutbutter.

But I-- I gotta go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<line>
I'm--

Yeah, I'm building a school for deaf kids.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
The kids get jealous

if I'm talking on the phone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<line>
Uh, okay, bye.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<line>
So, hey, hi.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<line>
How long are you thinking of staying here?

Just for my own reference.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
Oh, shit.

Is Wanda making you get rid of me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<line>
No one is making me do anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:53" />

<line>
Except keep acting in this movie you hate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<line>
Well, yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<line>
I really thought I could do it. I thought

I could go far away and help people

and be this best possible version

of myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<line>
And what happened?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<line>
I couldn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<line>
I wasn't the person I thought I was.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<line>
I'd love to stay and wallow with you,

but I gotta head out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
Today we're filming what used to be the

scene where Secretariat commits suicide,

but is now a scene where he swims

in a fishing hole

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<line>
-with his girlfriend "Susie Side."

-Yeesh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<line>
If you wanna blow off work,

I'm probably just gonna sit on the couch,

drink beer, and watch old episodes

of <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
Hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<line>
[audience laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<line>

-[audience laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<line>
-Sabrina!

-[Sabrina] What? I didn't peep!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<line>
Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<line>
[audience applauding]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<line>
Sabrina was such a little bitch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<line>
She was an orphan. She had a tough life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<line>
Hey, Diane, you're still here.

And BoJack is here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<line>
Did you go to work today?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
I was gonna, but then I remembered

everything is garbage,

so why bother doing anything?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<line>
-True story.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<line>
[the horse]<i> Oh, you didn't.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<line>

</line>

<line>

<line>
-Whoa.

-Mm.

<line>
Mm. Perfect.

<line>
Just so you know, I had to register

the corporation in your name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<line>
-What?

-Just until the divorce is finalized.

</line>

right now.

They're hawks.

Well, one literally.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<line>
This is a temporary technicality,

I promise.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<line>
I'm not gonna leave you holding the bag.

Okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<line>
Mm. Mm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<line>
Hey, your assistant wasn't out there,

so I just-- Ooh.

<line>
-Oh, hello.

-Look at this urn.

<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<line>
What's going on in here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, shut the door.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<line>
Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency,

and we want you to come with us.

-Right, so--

Why doesn't he ever go home?

<line>
Yeah, Goober's the one who should go home.

-Hey, Goober! Get murdered!

Hasn't picked up his shit in years.

<line>
Clean up your shit, Todd.

BoJack, I wanted to invite you

to my graduation show tomorrow night.

-Look, I know you think

it's just a dumb cult,

but you're my best friend

and it would really mean a lot

if you came.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<line>

to practice my space work.

Hello?

<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<line>
-What kind of pants are you wearing now?

-What? I don't know. The normal kind.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<line>
Yeah? Mm. Are they comfy?

A comfy pair of pants?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<line>
I guess. Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<line>
Just wondering

what kind of hit you're gonna take

when the studio sues the pants off you

for breach of contract.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<line>
They're suing me?

Also, are you wearing comfortable shoes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<line>
Because that was a long road to walk

to get to that punch line.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<line>
-This is serious.

-We're not just doing bits?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />

<line>
You started it with the pants thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<line>
You need to go back to set.

You can't just not go to work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
<i>Remember, you wanted this.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<line>
Are you saying you're finally ready

to settle down with yours truly?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<line>
Darn tootin'.

I may be a professional racehorse,

but I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
[Abe] Cut!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<line>
Perfect.

But let's get that last part again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
-Anything you want me to do differently?

-No, I just think we should get it again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<line>
You know, for safety.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
-Action!

-I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<line>
[slurps] And again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<line>
Why don't we get it like five more times?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<line>
I'm tired of running in circles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<line>
[Abe] Let's get it ten more times.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<line>
-Ta-da!

-We did it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<line>
-What now?

-We die, have our guts ripped out

through our noses,

and get enshrined inside of it. Duh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
Hey, BoJack,

can I talk to you for a minute?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<line>
Ooh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<line>
Alone, please?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<line>
Oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<line>
So, good news. We're gonna go on a trip.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
-Right now. You and me.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<line>
I booked us a room for the weekend.

Pack your bags, let's go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
Where? Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<line>
Less asking, more basking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<line>
In the sun, that is. Santa Barbara.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<line>
-I'm not really in the mood for--

-I think some time away

could be really good for us, as a couple.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<line>
I know you've been really bummed out

about the movie,

but I don't think moping around the house

with Diane all day is healthy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<line>
All I've ever wanted

was to be in this movie,

and you just want me

to put on a happy face--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<line>
Yes. There are lots of people

who don't like their jobs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<line>
Doesn't mean

they have to bring it home with--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<line>
-Yeah, that's easy for you to say.

-What is that supposed to mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
Well, come on.

You're a network executive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
You don't give a shit about work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<line>
I actually have a lot of pride

in what I do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<line>
What? You have a lot of pride?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<line>
Your job is to pump out garbage every year

hoping some of the garbage

stinks less than the rest

so you can quietly renew that garbage

and keep failing sideways

until you retire

to a three-point-five bedroom garbage

in Beverly Garbage

and spend the rest of your life

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
-watching your former assistant's garbage.

-I don't know where this is coming from.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<line>
Every good thing

that ever happened to you happened

because of network executives like me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
That show you spend all day watching,

your house, your career--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
Great house, great career, great life!

Must be why I'm so happy all the time!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
-You don't know--

-I don't?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<line>
My life was ruined

by a network executive like you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<line>
Well, I'm sorry

that things have been so hard for you,

but that doesn't give you the right to be

shitty to me. I can't be around someone

who's just fueled

by bitterness and negativity.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<line>
Well then, what are you doing here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<line>
What happened, BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<line>
Same thing that always happens.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<line>
You didn't know me.

Then you fell in love with me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<line>
And now you know me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<line>
You know, it's funny. When you look

at someone through rose-colored glasses,

all the red flags just look like flags.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<line>
-So, Wanda's moving out.

-Oh, shit. Because of me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
No. Because of me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<line>
I'm sorry. You wanna watch another episode

of <i>Horsin' Around?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<line>
Where Olivia does the school project

where she pretends an egg is a baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<line>
Spoiler alert:

Ethan needs to make an omelet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<line>
Why won't you go home?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<line>
I should. I know I should.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
I wish I could just go home right now

and crawl into bed

and not have to talk about anything

or explain anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<line>
He would just say, "How was your day?"

And then he would say,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<line>
"Hey, did you know the monorail

was invented by George Monorail?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
And I would say,

"I don't think that's true."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<line>
And he would say, "Well, if he didn't

invent it, he certainly perfected it."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<line>
And I wouldn't have to say,

"I'm sorry I left.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<line>
I'm sorry I made things so difficult.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
I'm sorry I'm not the person

I thought I was."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<line>
I would just say, "My day was good."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
And he would say, "I love you."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<line>
The longer you keep lying to him,

the harder it's gonna get.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
Can I ask you something?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<line>
That play in New York,

would that really have made you happy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<line>
Yeah. I mean, for a little bit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
And if Kelsey didn't get fired,

and you got to make the movie

you wanted to make,

would that have made you happy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<line>
For a little bit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<line>
But then...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<line>
Probably...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
So, what does it matter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<line>
But there has to be more.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<line>
Well, when's the last time

you were actually happy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<line>
You microchipped my penis? Check, please!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<line>
[all] Microchip.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<line>
[laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<line>
Ah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<line>
[audience applauding]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<line>
[doorbell rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<line>
[all] Todd!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<line>
-[Todd groans]

-[all laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<line>
[laughs] Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<line>
Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<line>
Hey. How are you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<line>
I can't do this anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<line>
You can't do what anymore?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<line>
I can't talk to you on the phone

all the time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<line>
It's too hard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<line>
Uh, have you tried Bluetooth?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<line>
I think maybe we should stop

calling each other, for a little bit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<line>
I'm sorry. I just miss you too much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:19" />

<line>
But listen, I love you. Okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:23" />

<line>
Uh, yeah. Uh, okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<line>
I love you, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:29" />

<line>
-Where is he?

-I don't know, sir.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:30" />

<line>
Can't do this to me. Where the hell is he?

</line>
