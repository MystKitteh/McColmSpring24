<p>
<i>-Sir, please get back into your car.</i>

<i>-Here's how it's gonna go down.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<p>
<i>You're gonna let me go.</i>

</p>

<p>
<i>If you're lucky,</i>

<i>I might even honk your... boobies!</i>

<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<p>
<i>Whoa! Hey! Hey!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<p>
<i>-for assaulting a police officer.</i>

<i>-You're arresting me?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
<i>You must be new here,</i>

<i>on the rag, or both.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<p>
<i>I'm movie star Vance Waggoner,</i>

<i>and I hate Jews!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
[drums] This is the<i> Deep Dive!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<p>
My guest today recently said some things,

or did some things?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
I only read the headline.

Vance, what happened?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
First of all, I don't hate Jews.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<p>
If I did, would I be able to sit

in the same room

as my good friend Mark Feuerstein, a Jew?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<p>
You know, when I first heard

Vance's comments, they stung,

but when he called to offer his apology

and a supporting role in his next movie,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<p>
I thought, "Does not the Torah

teach us to forgive?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
As it is written, "schmear, don't smear."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
[drums] Hey! Good to see you.

Thanks for coming, everyone!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<p>
Hey! Hey, Vance, did you get practice

swinging that baseball bat

from the time you hit that prostitute,

with a baseball bat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
What? Who told you that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm Tom Jumbo-Grumbo,

and this is<i> Gotcha!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<p>
{\an8}Vance Waggoner,

you hit a woman with a baseball bat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<p>
{\an8}What's your side of the story?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<p>
{\an8}Okay, look,

when that altercation occurred,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<p>
{\an8}I was an immature child... of 38.

I'm not that guy anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<p>
{\an8}Vance Waggoner respects women.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<p>
{\an8}We have a tape of a voicemail you left

for your 14-year-old daughter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<p>
{\an8}-Oh, God.

-Let's give it a listen, shall we?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<p>
{\an8}-[tone beeps]

<i>-I'll murder you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>I'm going to murder my daughter.</i>

<i>I don't respect women.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>You're out there, hanging out</i>

<i>with your dirty Swedish friends.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>That's right, I hate Swedes now.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>I bet you didn't see </i>that <i>coming,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>-you disgusting slut, who is my </i>daughter!

-[tone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<p>
{\an8}As we say here on<i> Gotcha,</i>

that's<i> a gotcha.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

<p>
{\an8}Why did I go on a show called<i> Gotcha?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:51" />

<p>
[camera shutters clicking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:53" />

<p>
I stand here with my wife beside me,

and my daughter,

and my good friend Stellan Skarsg√•rd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:58" />

<p>
-I am retiring from public life.

-[press corps gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<p>
This is the last you'll see

of Vance Waggoner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<p>
Who are we gonna get

to play Philbert's partner?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:09" />

<p>
We need a bad boy.

Someone dangerous,

someone you see coming

and think, "This guy is trouble."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:18" />

<p>
You know who would be perfect?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:21" />

<p>
[growls, grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<p>
-Thank you so much for meeting me.

-Of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<p>
I know how busy you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<p>
{\an8}The Apology Tour can be a hassle,

but you've been handling it perfectly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
{\an8}What do you have lined up next?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, I'm getting the lifetime achievement

at the We Forgive You Awards.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<p>
{\an8}You're getting a Forgivie?

Damn, your publicist <i>is </i>good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<p>
{\an8}I don't care about awards.

I just want to work, damn it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<p>
{\an8}You just have to remind them

how good you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
{\an8}Maybe by taking a meaty role on my gritty,

prestige television show<i> Philbert.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
{\an8}Once word gets out

that it's okay to hire you again,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<p>
{\an8}all the other offers will come rolling in.

Producers are like lemmings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
{\an8}-Hey, I resent that!

-Me, too!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<p>
{\an8}-I also resent that. To the cliff!

-Yeah, let's go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<p>
{\an8}I have a great deal of love and respect

for the lemming community!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
{\an8}Okay, I'm in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
Diane, can you believe this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
Vance Waggoner is getting

a We Forgive You Award!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<p>
Ugh! This town is full of hypocrites.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
{\an8}They act all shocked when one of their

favorite stars turns out to be a dirtbag,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<p>
{\an8}but they can't wait to give a comeback

to all the dirtbags we already know about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<p>
{\an8}Now, that is the kind of story

I would share without reading,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<p>
{\an8}which, for our purposes,

is even better than people reading.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<p>
{\an8}Go to the awards show,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
{\an8}take down that skeevy so-and-so,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
{\an8}and then during commercial breaks,

get in some Hollywoo hobnobbing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
{\an8}-Oh, I'd rather not.

-Diane, you have to hobnob.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
{\an8}Have you not been hobnobbing?

Hob that nob, girl!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
We know how this ends.

Our core readership eats it up,

a bunch of dude-bros

call me a "dumb slunt,"

and Vance's career chugs, right along.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
{\an8}So, stellar! And while you're there,

you can ask your friend BoJack,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<p>
{\an8}why Vance is gonna co-star

on his new TV show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<p>
He's what? Oop! Aaaah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<p>
[explosive music]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<p>
{\an8}Greetings, from the red carpet!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<p>
{\an8}Filling in for a Mario Lopez-type,

'tis I, Mr. Peanutbutter!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
{\an8}-And lookie here!

-[yelps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
{\an8}Super-producer and also my manager,

Princess Carolyn!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<p>
{\an8}Who are you wearing

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
{\an8}and why haven't you called,

about the<i> Dog Day Afternoon</i> reboot?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
{\an8}-Uh...

-It's cool. We can talk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<p>
{\an8}-They cut around stuff they don't need.

-Oh, okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
{\an8}No one understands how to make a woman

feel beautiful like Louis Kitton.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<p>
{\an8}Listen, kid.<i> Dog Day Afternoon</i>

isn't gonna happen for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<p>
{\an8}-People don't see you as the tough guy.

-That's not fair.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
Who are you excited to see tonight?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
So many amazing stars

are being forgiven tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
Megyn Kelly, Mark Wahlberg...

[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<p>
Look, every actor has a range,

and maybe a gritty drama

about a tough-guy bank robber

is too much of a stretch for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
So, I'm not tough enough, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
I'll show them how tough I can be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<p>
We'll be back with more of the Red Carpet

Pre-Show Fashion-Stravaganza,

so don't touch that remote...

[growls] or else.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
[choral music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
There is no one this town loves

forgiving more than Vance Waggoner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<p>
[applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
I just don't get why you're doing this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<p>
-We need a big star, Diane.

-No, Diane's right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<p>
-I'm the big star.

-That's not my point.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<p>
You can't have two stars.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
All the greatest detective shows

are focused around a central,

usually titular character.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
Kojak, Monk, Nickis.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<p>
-Who's Nickis?

-You know, Nickis.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
Sometimes, he goes to Los Angeles,

to New Orleans...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<p>
Are you...? Do you mean<i> NCIS?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn, if you hire this guy,

what kind of message does that send?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<p>
Diane, we both know

the industry is screwed up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
I'm not talking to the industry.

I'm talking to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<p>
-Take some responsibility.

-Excuse me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
Hey! Cheese plate!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
...Vance Waggoner!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
[cheering, applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
-Ugh!

-[camera clicks]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<p>
Horseman forcefully forgoes applause

for Vance at Forgivies!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<p>
Is a feud forming on the<i> Philbert</i> front?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
That's the buzz around town,

and the question on everybody's mind is,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
"Why the strong face?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<p>
{\an8}He made the face in protest because

of what Vance said about native Alaskans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<p>
BoJack's clearly upset

about the time Vance Waggoner

said the Madrid train bombings

were "a real mixed bag."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<p>
Remember when Vance locked

that shopgirl in a hotel room

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
{\an8}and said, "I've got pizzazz"

while masturbating into a champagne flute?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<p>
Because BoJack remembers.

[slurps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
{\an8}God damn it! The whole point of the award

was to put the past behind me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<p>
But now,

because of this idiot's dumb face,

my past is all anyone's talking about!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
Everyone else was clapping.

Why couldn't you clap?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
Hey, man, awards show

should've had better cheese.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<p>
-My publicist is furious, by the way.

-Ooh, spooky publicist!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<p>
Hope she doesn't papercut me

with her mad press release.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
We're gonna handle this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<p>
BoJack will go on TV and explain

this unfortunate<i> faux pas du fromage.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
-Won't you, BoJack?

-Ugh. Fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
Once again, hero BoJack will clean up

everyone else's mess.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
-Hello, Todd.

-Ooh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<p>
Did you notice how I just walked in

without knocking? Pretty tough, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<p>
Not at all!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<p>
To me, it read as amiable and familiar,

like our friendship has an assumed

"open door" policy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<p>
God damn it! [thumps] Owie!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<p>
Apparently, Hollywoo producers

don't think I'm tough enough

to play the bad boy parts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<p>
-Oh, no!

-Todd, you're the toughest guy I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<p>
[giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<p>
-Will you teach me how to be tough?

-I thought you'd never ask.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<p>
Because I had no idea

this was happening to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<p>
-[audience applauding]

-[music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<p>
BoJack, clear the air.

Why'd you give Vance the face?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
Well, there was this cheese--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
And you're lactose intolerant,

which reminded you

that Vance lacks tolerance?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
No, it--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<p>
The cheese stands alone,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<p>
{\an8}but no woman should stand alone,

when standing up to sexual harassment?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
{\an8}-Squawk!

-No, it wasn't any of those things!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<p>
{\an8}So, you're saying it wasn't any<i> one </i>thing,

more of an accumulation?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
-It--

-BoJack, it is really incredible,

your taking a stand against your co-star.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
{\an8}-No, I'm not taking any stand--

-I mean, the guy choked his wife,

and most of Hollywoo is, like,

"No biggie. Good for him!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
{\an8}-Squawk!

-Okay, well, obviously it's not good

he choked his wife.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
-Wow!

-[cheering, applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<p>
{\an8}No, no, no! I wasn't trying to make

some bold statement or anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
{\an8}It's just that...

choking your wife is bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
[cheering and applauding]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
Really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
{\an8}Can I just tell you how amazing it is

to hear a <i>man </i>say that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, Paloma,

someone needed to take a stand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
[cheering and applauding]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Call me crazy. I mean,

this is just old BoJack talking,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
{\an8}-but how about we don't choke <i>any </i>women?

-[cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<p>
{\an8}So true, right? Don't choke women!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
[all chanting] Don't choke women!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
BoJack is right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
{\an8}Hollywoo shouldn't legitimize abusers,

in movies and TV shows,

</p>

<p>
{\an8}that play off their problematic personas!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<p>
[audience] Hollywoo

shouldn't legitimize abusers

by allowing them to star

in movies and TV shows

that play off

their problematic personas!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
-All right!

-Squawk!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
And speaking

of battering women,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<p>
{\an8}right after the break, we'll show you

how to make the perfect blueberry pancake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
{\an8}-With proud feminist, BoJack Horseman.

-Stick around!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<p>
{\an8}And don't choke women! [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
[signal buzzes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
How is it you consistently do the opposite

of the thing I need you to do?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
Is it possible, this whole time,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:16" />

<p>
I've been an amazing feminist hero,

and nobody knew it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
-BoJack!

-Feels pretty right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
Yeah, I'm a male feminist.

You're welcome, society.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<p>
-I gotta call Vance.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
I'm just gonna stay here, being woke.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<p>
Vance! Listen,

BoJack's been very dehydrated.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
No, no, no. You can't use the old

"dehydration made him stupid" trick on me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
Okay?

I'm Mr. Dehydration-Made-Me-Stupid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
BoJack really wants to work with you.

He just got caught up--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
Doesn't matter.

I'm not doing the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<p>
<i>-What?</i>

-You were right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
All it took was one offer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
Once word got out I was doing<i> Philbert,</i>

all the other offers started pouring in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<p>
You signed a contract!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
Oh, please. I sexted a 12-year-old

and still got a Humanitas Prize.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
You think I can't get out of a contract,

with a time website?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<p>
By the way, still very sorry

about sexting that 12-year-old.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
[groans] Oh-hh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
Hey, Princess Carolyn,

you ever notice how, as a woman,

you only make ten cents

for every dollar your clients make?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
-Really makes you think, huh?

-BoJack, I was wrong, you were right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
Let's take that asshole down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
So, <i>now, </i>you wanna take him down

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
Now, that he's not doing

your TV show, anymore?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
Diane, don't be cynical.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<p>
-<i>I'm </i>cynical?

-What do you want me to say?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<p>
I got blinded by my desire

to see myself succeed,

which, since I'm a woman,

is actually very feminist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<p>
But now that Vance can't help me succeed,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<p>
I realize the more feminist thing to do

is to make sure <i>he</i> doesn't succeed either.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
-<i>I'm </i>cynical?

-I'm offering an olive branch, here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<p>
Look, this town loves assholes like Vance.

There's nothing we can do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
This town is as wishy-washy

as a virgin on prom night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<p>
All they need to listen to women

is the right voice-- a <i>man's </i>voice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
[BoJack] Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
-Is that why I'm here?

-Yep. I brought you two together

because between your feminist brain

and your stupid manly face,

you can actually say things

that people will listen to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<p>
That's a good point.

People do listen to me all the time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
One time I tweeted "RIP David Bowie,"

and now everyone still thinks he's dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
-David Bowie <i>is </i>dead.

-Wait, for real? Oh, man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
So, through BoJack, I can say

whatever I want, to a huge audience,

without being called "shrill,"

or "naggy," or "classic Diane."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
Yeah. Everyone loves a male feminist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
It turns out, the problem

with feminism, all along,

is it just wasn't men doing it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
We're much less shrill.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<p>
Yeah, this is truly a great day

for women everywhere.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
[rock music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<p>
Okay, how do I make people think

I'm a tough bad boy,

who doesn't give a care

about society's precious rules?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
Every time Vance Waggoner

breaks the rules,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
-it gets caught on camera.

-That's it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<p>
We just need some video evidence

of me being tough!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
Here, record this.

<p>
-Okay, just...

-[marker squeaking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
[sighs] Okay, so, pop culture

inherently normalizes things,

and that power works both ways.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
<i>It can normalize things for good,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
<i>like how dancing Ellen makes</i>

<i>middle America less afraid of gay people.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
<i>But it can also normalize things</i>

<i>for bad,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<p>
<i>like what Jack Bauer did for torture,</i>

<i>or what Jimmy Fallon did for lip-syncing.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:52" />

<p>
So, when we give a platform

to known abusers like Vance Waggoner,

that's an example of...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
Normalizing things for...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
-Good or bad?

-I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
I know you're trying really hard

not to be boring,

and it's kind of not boring,

but it still mostly feels

like I'm being lectured at.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
-Okay, well--

-Hold on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<p>
Let me imagine that I'm saying it.

You know what, that's a little better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
Well, the bar for men is depressingly low.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<p>
Just sprinkle in a few words like

"intersectionality" or "micro-aggressions"

and<i> Vice News </i>will name you

Feminist of the Year.

<p>

<p>
-Hello, Diane.

-[yelps] How did you get in my car?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
-You left it unlocked.

-It's a Prius. It locks automatically.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
Priuses<i> unlock</i> automatically.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
You still need to lock it

when you get out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
-Really?

-I know you and your little Scooby gang

are plotting something against my client,

and I want you to stop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
Ugh! Of course that dirtbag

would hire Ana Spanakopita.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<p>
Vance has a troubled past.

All he's asking for is a fresh start.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<p>
-No. Why does he get that over and over?

-He's reformed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<p>
What else would you have him do?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<p>
Let's say, you can make him do

anything you want to make things right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<p>
What would you make

Vance Waggoner do, now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<p>
Nothing.

I don't think he can make things right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
Well, then, what do you hope

to accomplish, here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<p>
Can't you just admit to me,

just between the two of us,

that this sucks?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />

<p>
You can say it's your job, that you

believe in "forgiveness," whatever,

but don't you at least a little bit think

that when we let guys

like Vance off the hook...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<p>
-Diane.

-...when you, as a woman,

give awful men

the cover of your friendship,

when you work for them.

First of all,

they're not gonna get better.

Second of all, you are then complicit...

no, you're culpable

for the terrible things they do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<p>
Are you done?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<p>
Just, woman to woman,

can't you admit this is screwed up?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
You've given me a lot to think about.

<p>
Oh...!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
{\an8}So, in conclusion,

is Smurfette a feminist icon?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<p>
{\an8}I think the better question is,

why does she have to be?,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<p>
{\an8}We've gotten a little off track, here.

We were talking about Vance Waggoner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<p>
{\an8}Oh, yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
{\an8}We actually have a tape of a press

conference Vance gave, earlier today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
{\an8}-What?

-And he mentioned you in it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<p>
{\an8}Oh, no, is this a<i> Gotcha?</i>

Am I the gotcha?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<p>
{\an8}Let's see what he had to say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<p>
{\an8}I have an important announcement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<p>
{\an8}-I... am a feminist, too.

-[applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<p>
{\an8}That's why I had to walk away

from BoJack Horseman's new show<i> Philbert.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<p>
{\an8}Okay, I read the scripts they sent me,

and I was outraged.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<p>
{\an8}Gratuitous sexual violence.

Protracted, lascivious nude scenes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
{\an8}Maybe BoJack Horseman thinks

that's all in good fun,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<p>
{\an8}but I know it's toxic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<p>
{\an8}And if I took part in it,

I would be complicit--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<p>
{\an8}no, culpable for that toxicity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<p>
{\an8}BoJack, what do you say to those charges?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<p>
{\an8}Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
{\an8}The future is female?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
Pretty cool, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<p>
-Uh, are you sure about this outfit?

-All the toughest guys wear leather.

</p>

most dangerous dive bar in Hollywoo.

It's where all the bad boys party.

Charlie Sheen, Chris Brown, Subway Jared.

a few bouncers, throw a drink in a face,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>

<p>
My depth perception

is so much better now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<p>
I'm gonna go watch a Wes Anderson movie

and see if I can perceive

any depth in <i>iiiiiiiiiiit!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<p>
And stay out!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<p>
Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
-So... did Philbert kill his wife?

-Well, Sassy thinks so.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<p>
That's why she's pretending

to be his new partner,

to get closer to the truth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<p>
Meanwhile, his old partner Fritz

is back in the mix,

but he might be dead

and just a projection

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
-of Philbert's lingering guilt.

-Ooooh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
-That's very unclear.

-Yeah, the whole thing's nonsense,

but, more importantly,

how do we prove it's not sexist?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<p>
-It is sexist.

-No, of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
But right now, I have to do an interview

where I explain that it's not,

because otherwise,

I'll look like a hypocrite,

which would be really bad

for women everywhere.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<p>
So, in order to save feminism,

you need to give me

some smart-sounding reasons

why Philbert

isn't what it so obviously is,

so that I can continue to be a hero

and role model.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<p>
Everything Vance said

about these scripts is true.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
It's posing as a deconstruction

of the edifice of toxic masculinity...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
Uh-huh. Toxic masculinity, yeah. Right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<p>
But it's just using that, as an excuse

to relish in its own excesses.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
And the most depressing thing...

is that ten times more people

are gonna watch this show

than read anything I've ever written.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<p>
I feel you're not really getting

into the spirit here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
We can still take down Vance

and topple the patriarchy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
Come on, we're doing feminism,

it's supposed to be fun!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<p>
This isn't fun for me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
Being a woman is not a hobby

or a pet interest of mine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
You get to drop in, and play Joss Whedon,

and everybody cheers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<p>
But when you move on

to your next thing, I'm still here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
Okay, yeah, I totally get that.

But in the meantime,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
I just need to know what to say

about this show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
Say whatever you want.

I have a listicle to write.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
So, unless you can give me

"five times Rihanna gave us life,"

this conversation is over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<p>
BoJack Horseman

is our<i> Deep Dive</i> guest, today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<p>
So, what's going on?

Something about your show being sexist?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<p>
My producer printed out an article

for me, but I did not read it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
Look, obviously,

when you take plot points out of context,

they can seem unsavory.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
But they're all part of a larger attempt

to deconstruct... toxic... masculinity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
Ooh! Sounds glamorous!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
No, we're not glamorizing it,

that's the thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
You're not supposed to like John Philbert

or agree with the things he does.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<p>
It's a TV show.

It doesn't glamorize anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
But... maybe it normalizes it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<p>
I gotta go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
Okay. We still have 48 minutes,

so, I guess <i>I </i>should just talk?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
-[clicks]

-I was eight years old

when my father

first showed me his scars.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
Each scar... tells a story,

and every story... leaves a scar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
[tires screech]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
-[yelps] Holy crap!

-Diane, the show needs your help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<p>
-What?

-You were right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
It's all the things you said it is,

but it doesn't have to be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
Come on as a consulting producer.

Work with Flip on the scripts,

make the show something

that we can all be proud of.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
Why would I do that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
You said it yourself, more people

are going to watch this show

than read anything you write.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<p>
I'm giving you the opportunity

to change society for the better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
-Nothing I do changes anything.

-No? You changed me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
[yelling, whooping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
Listen up, scum.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<p>
-[yelling stops]

-Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
-[woman grunts]

-There's a new sheriff in town.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
-And his name is...

-Trace Norcutt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
Yeah, I read about him this morning

in the metro section.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<p>
He just won a special election, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
-Maybe so, but I--

-[bartender] Wow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<p>
Thank you, sir, for keeping us informed

about the comings and goings

of our city politic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<p>
After all, a democracy is only as strong

as its populace is informed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
No, no, no, I was trying to--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
Hey, let's cheer once

for this kind stranger!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
-Hip! Hip!

-[patrons] Hurray!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
I guess Princess Carolyn was right.

Huh, Todd? Todd?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<p>
So, I guess the toughest thing of all

was being tough.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<p>
-Who are you talking to?

-Estelle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
-Who's Estelle?

-Just Estelle. You don't know her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
Not everybody needs to know everybody.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
Hmm. I have learned two lessons, today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<p>
We still need to cast Philbert's partner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<p>
No more bad boys.

We can't take another PR hit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<p>
We need an actor who everybody loves.

Someone almost annoyingly positive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<p>
Enthusiastic with zero baggage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
[phone beeping, meowing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<p>
You know who would be perfect?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
Hey, Flip! Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<p>
Yeah, you're the lady who's gonna make

my show less sexist, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
-Well, I'll see what I can do.

-Here's what I need.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
Sit in my office, don't chew too loud,

and collect your paycheck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
Then, when the show comes out,

people will see your name

in the credits and say,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
"Huh, a lady worked on the show.

Guess it's not sexist."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<p>
-I can contribute more than that.

-Not necessary.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
Hey, thanks for being here.

You're really making a difference.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
[door closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<p>
-Hello, Diane.

-[shouts] Jesus Christ!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<p>
I locked the doors this time!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
I broke your window,

because I needed to talk to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
-I have a phone!

-You were right about Vance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<p>
He just got fired off his new movie

after a drunken rant about the Chinese,

and then plowed his Hummer into the side

of the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
-Not the... Chinese Theatre?

-Mhm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
Anyway, his career is over,

for about two or three years,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
-and then he'll be fine again.

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
Listen, I'm sorry, the last time I saw you

I made things kind of personal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
No, no. You were right.

We give these men cover.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<p>
And if we give them cover,

we should know

exactly what they're capable of.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<p>
In fact,

I wanted to share this with you...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<p>
-woman to woman.

-[clicks]

</p>
