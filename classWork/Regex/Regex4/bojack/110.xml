<timestamp data-time="00:00:08" />

<p>
We're very different,

but I think that we bring out

the best in each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<p>
It's like you're chocolate

and I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<p>
Shut up and kiss me,

you silly goof.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<p>
<i>- </i>Cut!

- [buzzer sounds]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<p>
Welcome back

to <i>Excess Hollywoo.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm A Ryan Seacrest Type,

and I'm visiting the set

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
{\an8}of <i>Mr. Peanutbutter's Hollywoo Heist.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
I'm thrilled to be talking

to the star of the film,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
BoJack Horseman, and his

real life inspiration,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
Am I an inspiration?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<p>
Well, that depends

on how you define--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<p>
- Wait a minute. Yes, I am.

- Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
You know, I'm just over

the moon to be producing

this movie

about my daring exploit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<p>
- Yes, your<i> </i>daring exploit.

- Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
It's such a treat to be

shooting in my very own <i>casa.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
And it's an even sweeter treat

to be played by my good <i>amigo--</i>

dare I say best <i>amigo?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
- You "daren't."

- We're so in tune.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
We even finish each other's...

sentences.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<p>
Sometimes it doesn't happen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
- It never--

- Happens.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<p>
Ah, see?

I'm inside him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<p>
BoJack, you haven't worked

in quite some time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<p>
In fact,

I thought you were dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<p>
You must be so grateful to be

working again and also alive,

which, again,

I thought you were not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<p>
How did you get involved

with this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<p>
Well--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<p>
You want me to play

Mr. Peanutbutter

in the story he stole from me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<p>
I stole the D,

and then he stole

my stealing of it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<p>
That makes him an idea thief,

which is much less cool

than a thief thief,

which is what I am

and what he also is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<p>
You know what might help?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<p>
If you think about this

like a professional

instead of a big titty baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<p>
This movie is

a huge opportunity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:46" />

<p>
Quentin Tarantulino is known

for revitalizing dead careers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<p>
This could do for you

what <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>

did for Rin Tin Tin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:53" />

<p>
But isn't there

any other part?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:55" />

<p>
I could play myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<p>
No, BoJack's already being

played by Wallace Shawn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:59" />

<p>
What? The short guy

from <i>The Princess Bride</i>

who says "inconceivable"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<p>
- Why Wallace Shawn?

- BoJack Horseman?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />

<p>
I don't want to play

that boob.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:05" />

<p>
I'm trying to help

you out, Wally.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<p>
You're the one who keeps

buying expensive Rothkos.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<p>
I have a disease.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:11" />

<p>
Would you tell an alcoholic

to stop buying alcohol?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:15" />

<p>
You know,

<i>Black and Blue Number 7's</i>

going up for auction next week.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:18" />

<p>
Fine.

I'll do the dumb movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<p>
Fine.

I'll do the dumb movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:22" />

<p>
But if you find me in a bathtub

with open wrists tomorrow

and the words "I hate my agent"

smeared across the walls

in blood, you'll know why.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:28" />

<p>
So obviously I'm thrilled

to be here, just thrilled.

</p>

I know you're

Hey, stranger.

<p>
Haven't really seen you

since the wedding.

<p>
Kind of feels like we're

coming back to school

</p>

<p>
- after summer vacation.

- Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<p>
{\an8}I'll see you at the pep rally.

{\an8}Hope we don't get Mrs. Kirkman

<p>
{\an8}in a locker and write

"virgin slut" on my forehead,

and then when I ask how

I could be both a virgin

and a slut,

they make me eat a lipstick.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
{\an8}So what have you been up to

these last couple months?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
Well, I've been pretty busy.

Met a girl at Soho House.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<p>
- Was she your waitress?

- Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<p>
Then I met a girl at Mastro's.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
- Was she also your waitress?

- Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
Then I met a girl

at P.F. Chang's.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
Let me guess.

She was your--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<p>
A hooker, yes,

but what she really wants to do

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
- is wait tables.

- [laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<p>
Well, I, for one,

would love to meet

the aspiring food-service worker

who finally gets you

to settle down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<p>
{\an8}What?

Why would I want to settle down?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm 50.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<p>
- Yeah, anyway...

- So I'm sending the first draft

of the book to Pinky

this afternoon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<p>
- What? It's done?

- Not yet. Almost.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<p>
I'm excited for you to read it,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
{\an8}but I'm also

cripplingly nervous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<p>
{\an8}I actually kind of feel

like throwing up,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
{\an8}but I can't throw up because

I haven't had anything to eat

because this lady won't let me

in my own kitchen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<p>
Cast and crew only.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<p>
{\an8}Listen, if reading a book

you wrote is anywhere near

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<p>
{\an8}as great as it is

to actually spend time with you,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm sure

it's gonna be wonderful.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<p>
{\an8}Having said that,

what do I know about books?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<p>
I'm just a dumb actor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm here with Hollywoo darling

Naomi Watts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
{\an8}Tell me, what attracted you

to the role of Diane?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<p>
{\an8}I just keep getting

pigeonholed

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
{\an8}as these complex characters

in highly acclaimed movies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
{\an8}For once, I would just love

to phone it in

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<p>
{\an8}and play a two-dimensional girl

in a rom com

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<p>
{\an8}with no inner life of her own.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
{\an8}That's kind of the reason

I got into this business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
Ha ha!

You said words.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
{\an8}Now, is it true you stay

in character between takes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
{\an8}Oh, we all do.

The director insists upon it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<p>
{\an8}He even has everyone

calling me Diane

to help me get

in the headspace.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
It's been great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
Diane, looking good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<p>
- Um, thanks.

- Ugh, not you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
I was talking to Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<p>
Oh, thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<p>
Now, where's my peanut butter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<p>
Right over here, Q.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
No, I'm looking

for peanut butter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
Oh, you mean BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
If I wanted BoJack,

I would call BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
Did someone call for BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<p>
It really cuts

down on confusion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<p>
Ah, show business,

the great equalizer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<p>
Is that what it is?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
Todd, spritz me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
- Spritzing.

- Mm, mm, mm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<p>
Well spritzed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
Have you ever been

on a movie set before?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<p>
No, sir, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
{\an8}Please, Mr. Peanutbutter

was my father's name.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
- Uh--

- And it's also my name!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
[buzzer sounds]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
Ooh, speaking

of Mr. Peanutbutter,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
I'll be back

in a jiff, skippy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<p>
{\an8}Keep that air spritzed for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<p>
Aloha, <i>kemosabe.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<p>
Hey, allow me to put

on my producer hat

and produce you

just for one second here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
I have a few notes

on how you're playing me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
Let's see.

[humming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
Problems, problems, problems,

ah, here we go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
I find it really troubling

that my movie self

is wearing a crew neck T-shirt.

[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<p>
I only wear V-necks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
You see the problem.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
- I do not.

- I just think if we're telling

the story, we should tell it

how it really happened.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
Yeah, this whole story

isn't how it really happened.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<p>
Right...

because of the shirts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
Because I'm the one

who stole the D.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<p>
I'm the real hero here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
My life is full

of exciting adventures.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
I should write a book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
Oh, wait.

I did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
Suck on that, society.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<p>
Hey, you're in a mood.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<p>
Perhaps the tightness

of that crew neck

is cutting off circulation

to the brain?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<p>
Let me talk to Donna

in wardrobe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
We're gonna fix this, buddy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<p>
Donna!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
What are you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<p>
I'm just trying to get inside

my character, which is you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
Is this how we move our arms?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<p>
We're so weird.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<p>
Is this really necessary?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
Is this really necessary?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
That's not what I sound like.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
That's not mut

mi sound mike.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<p>
Hey, what's it been like

since we got married?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<p>
Is it everything we dreamed

of since we were little?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
When I was little,

I dreamed of getting

a MacArthur grant for my 'zine

about how all the girls

at school were bitches.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<p>
- Oh.

- Look, the wedding was great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<p>
But that's not real life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<p>
I mean,

I guess I got a happy ending,

but every happy ending

has the day after

the happy ending, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
And the day after that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<p>
So the wedding was so much fun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<p>
It was the happiest day

of my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<p>
But, you know,

what does that say

about all the days

I have left?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:49" />

<p>
Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<p>
We're such a Zoe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<p>
Oh, Todd, glad you're here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
Hold this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<p>
Todd, my jacket

is on the floor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<p>
You're supposed to hold

the jacket

so it doesn't go on the floor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<p>
Hey, sorry, BoJack--

I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<p>
But I work

for Mr. Peanutbutter now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<p>
- I mean, uh, Mr. Peanutbutter.

- Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
I can't believe

I'm on a movie set, you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
I mean, this is my first chance

to work on something big

since my rock opera

fell apart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
Man, I really messed up

that huge career opportunity

all on my own, didn't I?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<p>
Nothing sabotaged me one bit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
Yep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
You said it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
Well, see you later.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
[indistinct chatter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
Where can I grab a nosh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
Oh, craft services

is in the kitchen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
Up the driveway, through

the living room, make a left.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
- Can't miss it.

- I'm gonna grab a quick bite.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<p>
Don't do anything stupid

while I'm gone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
Okay, fellas, here's the thing

about the story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<p>
I don't buy it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
It's like something's missing,

but I can't put

any of my fingers on it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
Um, maybe once

we add the music--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<p>
The music?

Are you kidding me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
Music?

You're fired.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<p>
What dumb shit brought

this dumb shit?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
Okay, you're fired too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<p>
Oh, okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
Anyone else

got any bright ideas?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
Hey, maybe it make it

more Diane-y?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
- Um, excuse me?

- I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
This is probably stupid,

but the whole story's

about how this guy's

in love with this lady, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<p>
But we don't even know

who she is or what she wants.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<p>
I mean, maybe give her

more lines or words

or, I don't know,

feelings or whatever?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
He's new.

He doesn't know the rules.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<p>
Forgive him, mighty Caesar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<p>
Yes. Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
I love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
Who is this kid?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
You're a genius.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<p>
- I'm gonna kiss your face.

- What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<p>
Oh!

[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
Come back to my web.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
Let's talk

about Diane's feelings

and make this baby sing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<p>
Hey, Todd, talk to him

about the wardrobe,

specifically the top half

of the wardrobe,

specifically the shirt part

of the top half of the wardrobe,

specifically the neck part of

the shirt part of the wardrobe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<p>
[cell phone rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
Ugh.

What now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<p>
I'm sick

of this dog and pony show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<p>
The movie is dumb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter is annoying

the shit out of me,

and there's too much honeydew

in the fruit bowl.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<p>
Blech. Honeydew

is garbage fruit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<p>
Also, why is BoJack

being played by an old, nebbishy

five-foot-tall bald guy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<p>
Is that how the world sees me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<p>
Oh, I see.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>
So I can play

<i>Vanya on 42nd Street,</i>

but I'm not a deft-enough talent

to capture the essence

of the elusive

BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<p>
So sorry to offend you, sir.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
I'm just glad my book's

coming out soon

so people will get

an opportunity to see

the real BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
Oh, are you coming out

with a book?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<p>
You never mentioned it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
Plus,

Todd's being super weird.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
I think he's onto me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<p>
Onto you in regards to what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
Oh, right, I didn't tell you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<p>
I sabotaged his rock opera

by getting him readdicted

to a video game because

I didn't want him to move out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
Jesus Christ, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
Anyway, I think he knows

and might be plotting

to sabotage me back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
Why is it that 90%

of our conversations

these days revolve around

plotting sabotages?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
Are you saying I should

plot a countersabotage?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<p>
No, no more plotting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
Just be a good soldier

and do your job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
Nobody is out to get you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
[cell phone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
Have you seen the new draft?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<p>
They took it all off you

and put it on me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
Apparently some dickweed

named Todd

decided I should be

three-dimensional

and you should have no lines.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
Ugh. Isn't this town sick

of creating

three-dimensional roles

for women?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
This happens to me

all the time!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<p>
A.O. Scott is sick of talking

about how brilliant I am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
I guess

what I've been saying

for the last

seven uninterrupted minutes is,

how can I forgive my father

if I can't forgive myself?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
True dat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
But none of that matters,

because we bring out

the best in each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
I'm the chocolate,

and you're Mr. Peanutbutter!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<p>
- True dat.

- Mwah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
Cut!

Amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<p>
This is the movie

that I wanted to make.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
This is gonna be great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
- Oh, my God, I'm so--

- Ugh, what kind of idiot

puts food on top of a hill?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<p>
Hey, so I guess now that

the movie's all about Diane,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
I really need to dig deep

and get to know the real you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<p>
So let's talk and talk

and talk until I am you

and you are nothing

but a hollowed-out husk

of your former self and every

thought and every feeling

you ever had belongs to me

and me alone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
So do we like Sprite,

or are we more of a 7-Up girl?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<p>
Uh, that all sounds great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
But, you know, the person

you should really be talking to

is that guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
- Yeah, okay, I'm done.

- Diane loves talking to him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
They have great rapport.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
In fact, Diane could spend

all day talking to him

and never talk to me again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
Oh, I get it, because Diane

doesn't talk to Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<p>
- Diane talks to--

- Anybody else.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<p>
Hey, Todd,

remember that time

when you wouldn't clean

up your shit?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<p>
That was hilarious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<p>
- We've had some good times.

- Oh. Hi.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<p>
So I was thinking,

I have some...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
[sighs] pretty sloppy seconds

left over from P.F. Chang's

in the fridge, and I don't think

that I want it anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
Maybe tonight you could eat it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<p>
Friendly gesture

because we're friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
- Uh...

- Oh-oh, there's my guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
I heard you had a few more

thoughts about the script.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<p>
I do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
I was just thinking, what if

we made the BoJack character

into a real shithead?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<p>
- Is that really necessary?

- I don't think it's necessary.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>
Yeah, let's-- Let's make him

be a real selfish asshole

so the audience has someone

to root against.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<p>
You're probably right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<p>
Let's take another swing

at the script

and give BoJack more to do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
Now, when you say,

"Give BoJack more to do"--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
Not now, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
And also,

now that I'm thinking about it,

why does the movie

have to take place on Earth?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<p>
You are blowing my head.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
- I hope you like Oscars.

- Honeydew?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
More like,

"Honey, do I enjoy eating it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
Yes, I do." Right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
Not right, and I would love to

go through all the reasons why,

but I've got bigger concerns

right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
- Honeydew, go on.

- Did you notice

that the Mr. Peanutbutter part

has been cut in half?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<p>
- What is happening to our movie?

- I thought you hated the movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<p>
Yeah, I do, but if I'm

gonna be in a dumb movie

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<p>
I hate that makes no sense,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<p>
I should at least

be the star of it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<p>
Look, I agree that this movie

has really lost its way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
I mean, first of all,

why would Mr. Peanutbutter

wear a crew neck T-shirt?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
And second of all, uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
It's just the shirt,

isn't it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
It doesn't make sense.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<p>
I'm a V-neck man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<p>
A V you can put

your sunglasses in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<p>
Can you do

that with a crew neck?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<p>
Because I'd like

to see you tr--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<p>
Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<p>
Thanks so much for running

this scene with me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
I have so many lines to learn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<p>
Yeah, well, most of my lines

are, "True dat,"

but I guess it never hurts

to practice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
The citizens of Planet D

want their king back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<p>
But I'm more concerned

with getting my self-esteem back

after being in the shadow

of powerful men for so long.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<p>
True dat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
Is it just me,

or is this movie

kind of flying off the rails?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
Well, I don't want to overuse

my catchphrase here,

but true dat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
This is so typical.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<p>
I just wanted to do something

light and fun

to distract me from the deep

well of sadness that is my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
You probably

wouldn't understand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<p>
Oh, puh-lease.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
I'm so deep down

a well of sadness

that Baby Jessica

is like, "Damn."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<p>
Shut up and kiss me,

you miserable goof.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<p>
Oh. Okay. Mwah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<p>
Pop this in a drawer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<p>

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<p>
Oh, this is amazing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<p>
Naomi, I haven't felt

like this since--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<p>
No, no, shh, shh, shh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />

<p>
Call me Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<p>
Okay, got my bagel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<p>
Now back to work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<p>
Hey, guys.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
Hey, guys!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<p>
Wow, wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<p>
So you guys

really hit it off, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<p>
That's awesome.

<p>
Now, kiss me some sour cream.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<p>
Hey, so I finished the book

and sent the draft

to the publishers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<p>
What?

My book is ready?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<p>
Let me read it.

Can I read it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<p>
Call Pinky.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<p>
He'll probably send you a copy

as soon as he's done with it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<p>
All right!

You hang tight, baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
I got an instant classic

to read.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<p>
Keep the engine running, though,

because if I know me,

this book is gonna give me

a pretty big erection.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<p>
Okay, enjoy!

Keep an open mind.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
You'll love it.

It's a work in progress.

Let me read the book.

Give me, give me, give me.

Okay, okay, now,

I should warn you,

it's not quite what we expected,

but it is good.

<p>
I'm telling you,

this could really sell.

<p>
I might actually get

to see my kids again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
Great.

Send it over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
I'll read it right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<p>
All right, I sent it,

but just remember--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<p>
To set my expectations

sky-high?

What the shit was that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
What the shit is this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<p>
It's a phone.

Well, a tiny computer, really.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
I mean, amazing

what technology can--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<p>
You were supposed

to ghostwrite my memoir,

but instead you wrote

a story about how you spent

six months with me and saw

what a big, dumb loser I am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
Well, I realized

that the best way

to fully capture you,

warts and all--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
This isn't warts and all.

It's just warts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
Where's the all?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<p>
I come off like a total asshole.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
You come off

as complex and deeply troubled

but ultimately sympathetic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<p>
You might be too close

to see that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<p>
There's an entire chapter

about me eating apple fritters.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
You did go through

that fritter phase.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<p>
Is this book how you see me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
That day we ran errands

together,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<p>
I thought that we had

a really good time,

but you just wrote

about how I cried

because the dry cleaner

took my head shot down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<p>
You were very emotional.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<p>
They didn't even

replace me with anyone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<p>
Now it's just a faded spot

where my face used to be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
This will actually do wonders

for your career.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<p>
Trust me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<p>
I mean, you're just

a dumb actor

who doesn't know anything

about books, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
- [laughs]

- What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<p>
Remember?

From before?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
Oh, I don't think you

understand

what's happening here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<p>
This is not a casual

conversation between friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
This is your boss

telling his employee

that she did a bad job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<p>
- Try again.

- What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<p>
Start over, but do it right

this time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<p>
Nobody is ever gonna see this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<p>
- Ugh!

- [cell phone dialing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<p>
- [cell phone vibrating]

- Diane?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
Hey, Wayne,

you still work for <i>BuzzFeed</i>?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
Um, yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<p>
'Cause I got something

that's gonna get you

a shit-ton of hearts or digs

or smileys

or whatever the hell you measure

your journalism with.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
Curses!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<p>
My evil plan has been defeated,

but I'll be back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<p>
You haven't heard the last

of Evil Emperor

BoJackitron Horsemaniac.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
Oh, no!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
You shot a laser at me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
Oh, no!

I'm dying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<p>
Oh, no, I'm dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<p>
And so now

that we've escaped

the evil clutches

of the emperor,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<p>
I'm free to assume

my natural form,

an all-knowing floating orb

of light?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
True dat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
- Cut, cut.

- [buzzer sounds]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<p>
Come on, guys,

this is ridiculous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
Is this even a movie anymore?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<p>
Oh, maybe it isn't a movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<p>
Yeah, maybe it's

an immersive smartphone app

or a 21st-century approach

to 360-degree media envelopment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<p>
Yeah, or maybe it's just,

like, a feeling, you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<p>
- We've got work to do.

- Yeah, yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
- Oh, my God, this is so good.

- Oh, this is gonna be awesome.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
Yes!

Go, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
Are you just gonna leave me

like this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<p>
Anyone?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
Ah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<p>
Oh, good.

You're here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
Oh, hi, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<p>
This whole day's

been a shit show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<p>
The book turned out

to be a total hatchet job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<p>
The movie's a disaster.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
But thank God I have one

good thing in my life,

and that's you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<p>
BoJack, I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
Please let me say this

before I lose my nerve.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
I spent 50 years roaming

the countryside

as a wild stallion,

but I am tired of the rodeo,

and I'm finally ready

to saddle up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<p>
BoJack--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<p>
I guess what I'm trying

to say is,

this mustang wants to rest

his head in the comforts

of your spacious barn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
Uh, what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<p>
I'm in love with you, Naomi.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<p>
BoJack, they fired me

and replaced me

with a ball on a stick.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
I'm so sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<p>
But look at the bright side.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
Now you and I can just hang out

and talk about feelings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<p>
No, but you're not getting it.

Boys never get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
BoJack, I was in character

as Diane,

and as Diane,

we had a real connection.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<p>
But now that I'm off the movie,

I'm Naomi again,

and Naomi is not interested

in BoJack Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
In fact,

she thinks he's kind of gross.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
So I didn't fall in love

with Naomi Watts?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<p>
No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
You fell in love with Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<p>
Naomi what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<p>
Good-bye, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<p>
Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
See?

Nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
What's going on?

Why are they packing up?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
Oh, glad you're here.

This is exciting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
Since we last talked,

this film has gone through

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<p>
- so many permutations.

- So many.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
First, we reimagined

the whole film

as an interactive

social-media experience.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
Those are the dumbest words

I've ever heard.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
So we realized it was actually

more of a floating

art installation,

but that

didn't feel right either.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<p>
We thought,

is it a high-end perfume?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
A series of interrelated

fortune cookies?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
A hat that if you turn it

upside down, it's a boat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<p>
- No, it's none of those things.

- Exactly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<p>
That's why we finally

settled on this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<p>
Voilà!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
What am I looking at?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
[Todd] It is a bimonthly curated

box of snacks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
I don't know what that means.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<p>
I know.

It's confusing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<p>
Not the bimonthly

that means twice a month,

the bimonthly that

means every other month,

and each time

it's a different box of snacks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
This is the future of cinema.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<p>
You guys, finally,

my story has been told.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
Okay, that's a wrap, everyone.

[claps hands]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
Thanks for making

this box of snacks a reality.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<p>
Let's go home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<p>
What the hell happened

to the movie?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
Shit, there were snacks here

the whole time?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<p>
Not bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<p>
- Whoa!

- Look, I get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
You destroyed my big chance

at a comeback

as revenge for what I did

to your rock opera.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<p>
Revenge? Oh, that would have

been such a good idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
Damn it, Todd!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<p>
Look, I figured out

what you did,

but I've been trying to put it

behind me and do my job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<p>
So cutting my part down

was not about revenge?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<p>
No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
And making BoJack the villain

of your movie

was not a coded statement

of your feelings about me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<p>
No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
Oh, okay, great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
Well, I'm-- I'm glad

we buried the hatchet

and everything's cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
Uh, actually, you know,

everything is not cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<p>
You ruined my rock opera

by using character actress

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
Margo Martindale to trick me

into playing

an addictive video game.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
And saying it all together

like that,

it all sounds

kind of ludicrous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
But still, it was something

I cared about,

and what you did

really hurt me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<p>
Oh.

Well, this feels shitty.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
You sure you don't want to just

get some revenge real quick--

thump me once in the stones

and then we'll be even?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<p>
I got to go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
I've got some artisanal popcorns

to gauge the mouthfeel of.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
<i>- </i>Hey, BoJack.

- Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<p>
You want an apple fritter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
Uh, sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
- Yeah, I bet you would.

- [laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
I bet you'd like

an apple fritter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<p>
Yeah, an apple fritter

would be great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<p>
Why? What-- What--

What's happening here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
"Five Shocking Facts

From New BoJack Book"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
No.

No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
Um, everyone,

please turn off your Internet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
It has gone bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<p>
I repeat,

the Internet has gone foul.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<p>
- What a loser.

- I'm glad I'm not that guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<p>
Give me your phones.

I'm a celebrity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
You have to listen to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<p>
Look at his deep well

of sadness.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
It's hilarious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<p>
Don't look at me.

I'm well-adjusted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<p>
- You all want my life.

- [laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<p>
Uh, what the hell?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
I know, I know.

But if you just listen for--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
You posted your dumb little

book on the Internet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<p>
No, I just leaked

the first couple chapters,

and people are already talking

about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:58" />

<p>
This is wildly unprofessional.

Who do you think you are?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<p>
I know you're mad,

and you have every right to be,

but you got to read

some of these comments.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<p>
People love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<p>
And they're gonna love you

even more

when they read the rest

of my book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<p>
- Your book?

- Our book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<p>
Nobody is gonna read

that book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:13" />

<p>
How do you still not get that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<p>
It is never going

to be published.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:17" />

<p>
BoJack, I stand by my work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:19" />

<p>
This is a really good book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<p>
And if you just give it time,

you'll see.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<p>
Maybe you're right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<p>
Really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:29" />

<p>
No.

You're fired.
