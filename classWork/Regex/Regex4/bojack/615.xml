[birds chirping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<p>
[doorbell rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<p>
What you got there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<p>
I think it's a hydrangea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
Does she even like that kind of plant?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<p>
Probably not. She doesn't like anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
Hello, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
Thanks for having me, Mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<p>
You're the guest of honor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
Everyone, BoJack is here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<p>
-[Herb] Hey, buddy! Get in here!

-[Sarah Lynn giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
-For you.

-Oh, a plant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
-Dirt for inside. Goody.

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<p>
[theme music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<p>
[dripping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<p>
You got here just in time, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<p>
A bird flew in through the window

and we're having trouble

getting her out of the house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<p>
[Sarah Lynn] Yeah, call yourself early

and go get a worm!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:48" />

<p>
Golly, she's more coy

than a coyote claiming a cottontail.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:51" />

<p>
-Ahem. Phone for you, Mrs. Horseman.

-[grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:53" />

<p>
Thank you, butler.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<p>
-Is that Zach Braff?

-Who?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<p>
{\an8}Zach Braff. Actor, independent filmmaker,

real-life friend of Donald Faison?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<p>
{\an8}-You mean my butler?

-At your service!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<p>
{\an8}I actually was friends with Donald

in real life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:05" />

<p>
{\an8}He's a spectacular man--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<p>
{\an8}-Butler!

-Sorry! Phone call for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:08" />

<p>
{\an8}I'll take it in the kitchen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<p>
{\an8}BoJack, make yourself useful for a change

and help, will ya?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<p>
{\an8}With the bird?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<p>
{\an8}Hello? Oh, it's you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:18" />

<p>
{\an8}All right. That does it! [grunts]

Son of a--!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:21" />

<p>
{\an8}With a drop like that,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:23" />

<p>
{\an8}you'd think she was the ratings

for <i>Veronica's Closet</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:25" />

<p>
{\an8}when it moved to Mondays.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:26" />

<p>
{\an8}Ugh. Comedy poison.

Who wants to laugh on a Monday?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:29" />

<p>
{\an8}BJ! Finally made it

to our little soir√©e, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<p>
{\an8}Yeah, I kept having this dream

where I was having dinner

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<p>
{\an8}with all the people who were gone

and I thought, "I should do that!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<p>
{\an8}So, here I am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<p>
{\an8}-We've got to flank her from the left.

-[bird] Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<p>
{\an8}Hello. Crackerjack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<p>
{\an8}-That's what it says on my underpants!

-[giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:47" />

<p>
{\an8}[grunts] The uncle I never met

and yet could never live up to!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<p>
{\an8}[grunts] All right, soldier. Ready, aim...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<p>
{\an8}-[bird giggles]

-Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<p>
{\an8}Hey! What's up, man?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<p>
{\an8}Hey, Corduroy. [stammers] Good to...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<p>
{\an8}Still weirded out because the last time

you saw me I was naked,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:03" />

<p>
{\an8}hanging from my iPhone charger,

holding a lemon, with a very erect penis

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<p>
{\an8}despite being deceased in my trailer

for over an hour?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<p>
{\an8}Yep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<p>
{\an8}You're gonna have to get over that, buddy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<p>
{\an8}Hmm. Mm. Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
{\an8}-What are you...? Stop that.

-Oh! Oh, sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
{\an8}Forgot where I was for a second.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
{\an8}-Think this'll help?

-Kid's got the right idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<p>
{\an8}We can chuck the choker

and spook her with this poker!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<p>
{\an8}-Show her who's boss!

-[Sarah Lynn] Ruffle her feathers!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<p>
{\an8}[Corduroy] Get her to the kitchen!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<p>
{\an8}[grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<p>
{\an8}And that!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<p>
-All right!

-[Herb] Go!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
[Crackerjack] Ha-cha!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
-[Sarah Lynn cheers]

-[all whooping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
Yes, yes, BoJack bullied a bird.

Bully for him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
Speaking of useless,

my husband is running late,

so we're gonna start dinner without him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
He'll be here before the show starts,

won't he?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<p>
{\an8}He'd better be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
{\an8}In the meantime,

let's adjourn to the dining room

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
{\an8}before our dinners get

as cold as my parenting style.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<p>
[all laughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
[Sarah Lynn] I think mine would be

the first time someone asked

for my autograph.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
-Really?

-Oh, wow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<p>
I didn't even know how to write my name!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
I just drew a squiggle!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
-Water?

-Thank you, Zach Braff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
You only get to give

your first autograph once, you know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
The second time it becomes an obligation,

the third time a chore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
But the first time...

[sighs] The first time... [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<p>
-Hey. What is that?

-Ah, ah, ah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<p>
Shh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<p>
-[BoJack] Mm.

-Okay. My turn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
Mine was also when I signed

on a dotted line to enlist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
Are you ready to sing "The Lollypop Song"

in the big show later?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
No, Mom.

You know I never make it to the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<p>
I didn't know then that enlisting

would lead to my two worst parts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
You have two?

I didn't know we could pick two.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<p>
Corduroy, it's a conversation,

not an assignment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<p>
-[Corduroy] In that case, I have three.

-[Herb] Three is way too many.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<p>
My worst parts were saying goodbye

to my mother

and seeing a bullet go straight

through my general's face,

right before it hit my own.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<p>
-[all gasp]

-At least your death was instantaneous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
I can still hear the loud drips of my IV

from when I had cancer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<p>
-Drip. Drip.

-Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<p>
-[Corduroy] What about you, BoJack?

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
Best part, worst part, what about you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<p>
Well, I guess my worst part

has to be, um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
Right before I got here, I think? Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
I went to Angela Diaz's house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
[gulps, spits] Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<p>
Does anyone else's water

taste like chlorine?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
Hey, Braff, can I get

some different water over here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<p>
Right away, Mr. Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
Crackerjack, do you think your death

meant something

because it was in the service

of a greater cause?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
-Aw, shucks.

-Of course it meant something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
I think questions like that are too big

for a little soldier like me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
My brother gave the ultimate sacrifice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<p>
-Because sometimes I wonder--

-But see, this is where I get hung up,

because when we valorize

the idea of sacrifice,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
-of loss, of suffering--

-BoJack, don't start with this again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
When we grow up

in a house that does that,

we internalize this idea

that being happy is a selfish act,

but sacrifice doesn't mean anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
-[Sarah Lynn] Yes, it does.

-Sacrifice?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<p>
In the service of something greater,

maybe, but just in and of itself?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
-What's the good in that?

-A lot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
Sacrifice is good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
It has to be because I sacrificed a ton,

and I was freaking awesome.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
Oh, and what did you ever sacrifice?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<p>
I gave everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
I gave my whole life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<p>
You died in a hedonistic bender.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
I'm not talking about my death.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
I'm talking about my life.

I gave my whole life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<p>
If we get into everyone's whole life,

we're gonna be here all night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
It's called "Best Part/Worst Part,"

not "Everything That Ever Happened."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
Okay, worst part:

the 2007 "Sexually Confident Virgin Tour."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
My manager leaked nudes

to get more tour dates added,

my mom pointed out every carb I ate,

it was hell.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<p>
But it gave millions of fans

a show they will never forget.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
And that is worth something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
No, that's a high you chase.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
-It was not.

-You think you singing songs on stage

is the same thing as this guy

who died liberating the camps?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<p>
We don't need to compare

apples to Auschwitzes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<p>
Herb, tell 'em. It means something--

the work we do, the joy we bring.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<p>
It has to, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
Boy, I sure thought so.

I-I used to really believe in it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
I mean, I was one "trapped in an airport

during a snowstorm

on the eve of the dance championship

guest starring Gregory Hines" episode

away from an Emmy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
Then I lost it all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
Ow! Seriously, is no one noticing

this leak?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<p>
Fine, we'll get a bucket.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
-The drips are hitting me!

-Then you'll hold the bucket.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
But the funny thing is,

it wasn't until I got fired

that I actually became myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
I was out of the closet. I was free.

I was authentically me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<p>
What does being authentic

have to do with anything?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<p>
Well, when I wasn't hiding

behind some facade, I could be at peace.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<p>
That's when I really got

into philanthropy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
-Can I ask you something, Herb?

-Why do people say that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<p>
If you're asking it, then yes,

you can and you will and you just did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<p>
Yeah, why are we announcing our questions?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<p>
-Yeah, what are these questions, royalty?

-[imitates fanfare]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<p>
Announcing King and Queen Query

of the Interrogative Isle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
May I ask you how do you do?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
-Very well, thanks.

-Ah, bup, bup, bup!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<p>
I didn't ask you yet.

I asked if I could ask you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
Did you get pleasure

from your charity work?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<p>
Like real, deep pleasure?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
It dwarfed every other joy in my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<p>
Doesn't count then.

If you got pleasure, it wasn't selfless.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<p>
And it's only good if it's selfless.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<p>
Who made up that rule? I helped people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<p>
Who cares if it made me feel good, too?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
Feeling good is inherently selfish.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
If I'd given myself to Christ,

truly went down the path--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
I don't care for this talk of religion

in my house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
If I wasn't constantly

trying to feel good, get it better,

always looking for maximum pleasure...

[sighs] That was my worst part.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<p>
Well, one of the three worst parts.

Wait, actually, can I have four?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<p>
Discovering you in your trailer

definitely cracks my top five.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
This is bullshit!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
I did a lot for a lot of people!

I was not a bad person.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
No one is accusing you

of being a bad person, Sarah Lynn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<p>
[yelling] You are! You all are

with your "being authentic"

and "charity work" and "killing Nazis."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
I actually never killed a Nazi.

All my kills were friendly fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<p>
I also never liberated any camps.

I'm honestly not sure what I did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<p>
Here you go.

Your husband just pulled up, ma'am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<p>
Wait, Dad's here?

He's never made it to dinner before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
-Hey, here's a question.

-Another question has arrived!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<p>
Did any of you have a song of yours

played in outer space?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
Anyone? No. Just me? Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<p>
That's what I thought.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
My hit single "No, No, No (No Means Yes)"

is making its way to Mars!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
That means something.

I will be remembered.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<p>
-That has to mean something. I will be--

-[door opens]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<p>
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss the show?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<p>
-Hey!

-There he is! There's our guy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<p>
-Dad!

-I...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
Oh, you didn't miss a thing.

It's not like we have anywhere to be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
Why shouldn't we all bend ourselves

to your schedule?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<p>
I already apologized. I was running.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<p>
Yes. As always, running late,

while I was running myself ragged

trying to get dinner on the table.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
-[clears throat]

-Yes, you helped.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
And now I'm running out of patience

for you running your mouth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<p>
And I'm running out the clock

until we both...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
Well. Here we are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<p>
I'll just squeeze in here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<p>
-Get yourself something nice.

-Ooh! Thank you, Mr. Secretariat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
-What'd I miss?

-We're playing Best Part/Worst Part.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<p>
Ooh! I got one! Machu Picchu.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<p>
When I left "Horsin' Around,"

I honestly thought about killing myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<p>
Shit, Herb. Really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
Yeah. But the Knicks

were having a good season

and I wanted to see what happened.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
Wait, you didn't kill yourself

because the Knicks

were having a good season?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
What would you have done

if they were having a bad season?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>
I don't know. Gotten into baseball?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
Oh, for the love...

Where's your follow-through?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
It's like you didn't even

wanna kill yourself!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<p>
And I'm so glad I didn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
Because there I was ten years later

at Machu Picchu

and I realized there was so much more

I could do in a life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<p>
Okay, my turn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<p>
August 22nd, 1973,

I was banned from running ever again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
And running, well, that was the only thing

that ever made sense to me,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
-so if I couldn't do that I was nobody.

-[coughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<p>
-This is your worst part?

-Best part: jumping off that bridge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
-Jesus.

-What did I say about the Jesus talk?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
It was my choice.

I got to go on my own terms.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
Not a lot of people can say that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<p>
-No.

-That's true.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<p>
The view from up there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
-Eh, you wouldn't believe it.

-[coughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
-[all laughing]

-Oh, my.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
-It must've been from swimming earlier.

-Oh, you were swimming?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<p>
Yeah. I, um... [clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<p>
-When was I swimming?

-Don't think about that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
-Do you have a best part?

-Oh, uh, I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<p>
This past year I took a teaching job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<p>
And I had this one student

who was really struggling,

just couldn't get over this hump.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
And what, you helped him

do good in a scene? For your class?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<p>
That's the best part of your whole life?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
I don't know, I was just spitballing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<p>
I didn't know you were gonna put me

on the spot like this!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
Come on, buddy.

What was so special about that moment?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<p>
It felt good to help someone do something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
See? Helping someone, like I said!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<p>
But he liked it because it felt good,

like I said!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<p>
I liked it because it reminded me

of when I was young, just starting out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
You and me, screwing around,

hitting up open mics.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<p>
Trying to figure it out. I think...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
-I think that was the best part.

-Really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
Well, are we ready to start the show?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<p>
-[Corduroy] Let's do this!

-Okay, nice seeing you all!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
You're not coming?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
This is always the part where I wake up.

You all go to the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
Zach Braff says "Pardon my reach"

even though he can clearly

get my plate from another angle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
-Then I wake up.

-Oh, okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<p>
-Next time then. [sighs]

-[dripping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
Pardon my reach.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
[Herb] Hello, everyone!

Please take your seats.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
Tonight's show is in honor

of BoJack Horseman!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<p>
What do you say, huh?

Should we get this show started?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
Yeah! Tonight's opener

needs no introduction,

but I'm gonna give her one anyway.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<p>
Ladies and gentlemen,

the one, the only, Sarah Lynn!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
-[audience cheers, applauds]

-Thank you, thank you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<p>
I'd like to dedicate tonight's performance

to the man of the hour, BoJack Horseman!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<p>
Sarah Lynn, I'm so sorry

for everything that happened with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
With us. I should have protected you...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<p>
Ah, ah, ah. BoJack. This is my time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
Yes. Of course. Sorry.

</p>

your friend and mine,

-Where did Sarah Lynn go?

-Shh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<p>
-Try to enjoy the show.

-[grunts] Ha!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
-Where does this door go?

-Sit down, buddy. You'll get your turn.

</p>

-Watch out!

<p>
Down in front, please?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<p>
All right,

let's keep this show going, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<p>
Next up, you know him, you love him,

please a give a warm, warm,

burning hot welcome to...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
-Hey. You wanna grab a smoke?

-...Zach Braff!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<p>
-Yes. Yeah, let's get out of here.

-[audience cheering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<p>
[Zach] Oh-ho, whee! I'm honored.

Honored, honored.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
So, what's on the other side of that door?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<p>
The nerve of that guy.

With the beard. Herb?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<p>
Yeah. Herb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />

<p>
What, he says he's at peace?

'Cause why, Machu Picchu?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<p>
-I don't buy it.

-I don't know. I... I believe him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
I promise you,

every single person in that room

would go back if we could.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<p>
Peace? That's someone

trying to convince himself of something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
-Of what?

-That life has meaning or purpose, that...

that if you check the right boxes

and do the dance,

then you get a little parting gift

at the end,

a framed certificate that says,

"Congratulations, you've got peace."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<p>
[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<p>
-I wouldn't mind that.

-But guess what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<p>
All the time those people spent,

trying to do good or help people

or be something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<p>
I did none of that shit,

and yet here I am, same as them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<p>
You were the fastest runner in the world.

You inspired millions.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
And yet, here I am, same as you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<p>
So, if you could go back, do it again,

what would you do different?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
[sighs] What would I do?

I wouldn't have cared so much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<p>
Cared about what? Racing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
About everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<p>
I know this part is confusing

because I'm Secretariat

and also your dad for some reason,

but speaking as your dad,

it's important that you know that I cared.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<p>
No. You never cared.

You cared about your book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<p>
You cared about getting drunk

and telling everyone

how miserable you were,

but that's not caring.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
You think I didn't care

because I put up walls,

but I cared so much, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<p>
About you, about your mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<p>
I wanted you to respect me.

I wanted you to love me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<p>
I was so afraid that you would know that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
I cared so much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
It's a shame that we could never

talk like this in real life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
All the good it would have done.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
Least we got the chance this time,

before I wake up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<p>
[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<p>
Wake up?

Oh, you're not getting it, are you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
Getting what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<p>
Loss is a collaborative art,

between the people who leave us

and those who remain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
We dance with the shadows

of their absence.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<p>
-With that in mind, I present to you...

-[grunts] Stop the show!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<p>
-Excuse me.

-What's happening?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<p>
You're being very rude.

I was about to do my roller-dance routine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<p>
-Calm down, son.

-Yes, why don't you sit down, and--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
-No!

-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no. Please!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<p>
I'm not ready. I never got to direct

my <i>Backdraft</i> remake:

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:32" />

<p>
"Zach Braff's Backdraft"!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
I never finished my memoir:

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
"I Started A Zach Which Started

The Whole World Braffing!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<p>
I never got to license

with the Braff Bucks app!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
I need to wake up. I can't be here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
Of course. Everything's always about you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<p>
-BJ, buddy...

-Herb! How did I get here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<p>
How the hell should I know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<p>
I broke into my house.

But it wasn't my house anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<p>
I was... I was watching

the "Horsin' Around" Blu-ray.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<p>
Yes. Yeah, and I drank some more

and I found some pills.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
And then I went swimming...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<p>
No! No! No! No, wait, wait, wait!

I got out of the pool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<p>
Yes! And I called Diane!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<p>
BoJack, we're trying to do a show here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
But I called Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<p>
I couldn't have drowned

if I got out of the pool to call Diane!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
So, I shouldn't be here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<p>
[stammers] If I could just finish

the conversation. Where's a phone?!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
[pants]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<p>
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

we have a real treat for you next.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<p>
A real treat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<p>
Come and see him

before he makes a run for it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<p>
-No! Stop!

-It's Secretariat!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<p>
Stay calm. Flyin' off the handle

won't change a thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
This was gonna happen to you

one of these days.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<p>
A poem. Original, obviously.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<p>
It's called "The View from Halfway Down."

[clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<p>
"The weak breeze whispers nothing

The water screams sublime

<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
His feet shift teeter-totter

Deep breath, stand back, it's time

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
Toes untouch the overpass

Soon he's water bound

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
Eyes locked shut but peek to see

The view from halfway down"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
[audience applauds, cheers]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<p>
I'm not done. Hold on. I'm not done.

I'm not done. [clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<p>
"A little wind, a summer sun

A river rich and regal

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<p>
A flood of fond endorphins

Brings a calm that knows no equal

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<p>
You're flying now

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<p>
You see things much more clear

Than from the ground

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
It's all okay, it would be

Were you not now halfway down

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
Thrash to break from gravity

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<p>
What now could slow the drop?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<p>
All I'd give for toes to touch

The safety back at top"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
I change my mind. [stammers]

I change my mind. I don't wanna--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
It's okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
"But this is it, the deed is done

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
Silence drowns the sound

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
Before I leaped I should have seen

The view from halfway down

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<p>
No! I really should have thought

About the view from halfway down"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<p>
Find your peace, big guy. Find it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<p>
"I wish I could have known

About the view from halfway down--"

<p>
[BoJack gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
I need to get out of here!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<p>
-Wha--

-BJ, where do you think you're going?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<p>
Nothing you do in here matters, pal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<p>
Yelling and struggling isn't gonna

pull your body out of that pool,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<p>
-so you might as well just--

-Sit down! [echoes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<p>
But I...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<p>
Look, BJ, it's possible that someone

is going to find you and save you,

and it's also possible that someone won't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<p>
We don't get to know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<p>
Can I ask you a question?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<p>
[imitates fanfare]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<p>
Has anyone ever come back from this place?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
BJ, there is no place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<p>
It's just your brain going through

what it feels like it has to go through.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
All you can do right now

is sit back and enjoy the show.

<p>
This is the hard part. [grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
Golly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
And now the easy part.

<p>
Wow. Beatrice Horseman, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
You know, she was gonna sing

for us tonight,

but apparently, she was a little "horse."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
[chuckles]

</p>

Okay. You ready for the headliner?

A talented charmer

and a stupid piece of shit.

<p>
It's... BoJack Horseman!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
Is it terrifying?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
No. I don't think so.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
It's the way it is, you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<p>
Everything must come to an end,

the drip finally stops.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<p>
See you on the other side.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<p>
Oh, BoJack, no, there is no other side.

This is it.

Thank God, Diane. Okay, Diane.

Diane, you're gonna save me, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
I called you

and you're coming to get me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<p>
<i>BoJack, why did you call me?</i>

<i>I live in Chicago. I can't save you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<p>
-You didn't pick up.

<i>-Right.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<p>
-It went to voicemail.

<i>-Yeah.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

And then... I went back in the pool.

<i>I'm not real. None of this is.</i>

</p>

<p>
-So, what do I do now?

<i>-BoJack, it doesn't matter.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<p>
Well, if it doesn't matter,

can I stay on the phone with you at least?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<p>
<i>Okay.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:29" />

<p>
How was your day?
