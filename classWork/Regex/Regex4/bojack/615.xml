<line>
[doorbell rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<line>
What you got there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<line>
I think it's a hydrangea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<line>
Does she even like that kind of plant?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<line>
Probably not. She doesn't like anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
Hello, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<line>
Thanks for having me, Mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<line>
You're the guest of honor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
Everyone, BoJack is here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<line>
-[Herb] Hey, buddy! Get in here!

-[Sarah Lynn giggles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<line>
-For you.

-Oh, a plant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<line>
-Dirt for inside. Goody.

-[sighs]

</line>

[theme music playing]

<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<line>
[dripping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<line>
You got here just in time, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<line>
A bird flew in through the window

and we're having trouble

getting her out of the house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<line>
[Sarah Lynn] Yeah, call yourself early

and go get a worm!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:48" />

<line>
Golly, she's more coy

than a coyote claiming a cottontail.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:51" />

<line>
-Ahem. Phone for you, Mrs. Horseman.

-[grunting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:53" />

<line>
Thank you, butler.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<line>
-Is that Zach Braff?

-Who?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<line>
{\an8}Zach Braff. Actor, independent filmmaker,

real-life friend of Donald Faison?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<line>
{\an8}-You mean my butler?

-At your service!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<line>
{\an8}I actually was friends with Donald

in real life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:05" />

<line>
{\an8}He's a spectacular man--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<line>
{\an8}-Butler!

-Sorry! Phone call for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:08" />

<line>
{\an8}I'll take it in the kitchen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<line>
{\an8}BoJack, make yourself useful for a change

and help, will ya?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<line>
{\an8}With the bird?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<line>
{\an8}Hello? Oh, it's you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:18" />

<line>
{\an8}All right. That does it! [grunts]

Son of a--!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:21" />

<line>
{\an8}With a drop like that,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:23" />

<line>
{\an8}you'd think she was the ratings

for <i>Veronica's Closet</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:25" />

<line>
{\an8}when it moved to Mondays.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:26" />

<line>
{\an8}Ugh. Comedy poison.

Who wants to laugh on a Monday?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:29" />

<line>
{\an8}BJ! Finally made it

to our little soir√©e, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<line>
{\an8}Yeah, I kept having this dream

where I was having dinner

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<line>
{\an8}with all the people who were gone

and I thought, "I should do that!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<line>
{\an8}So, here I am.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<line>
{\an8}-We've got to flank her from the left.

-[bird] Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<line>
{\an8}Hello. Crackerjack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<line>
{\an8}-That's what it says on my underpants!

-[giggles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:47" />

<line>
{\an8}[grunts] The uncle I never met

and yet could never live up to!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<line>
{\an8}[grunts] All right, soldier. Ready, aim...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<line>
{\an8}-[bird giggles]

-Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<line>
{\an8}Hey! What's up, man?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<line>
{\an8}Hey, Corduroy. [stammers] Good to...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<line>
{\an8}Still weirded out because the last time

you saw me I was naked,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:03" />

<line>
{\an8}hanging from my iPhone charger,

holding a lemon, with a very erect penis

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<line>
{\an8}despite being deceased in my trailer

for over an hour?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<line>
{\an8}Yep.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<line>
{\an8}You're gonna have to get over that, buddy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<line>
{\an8}Hmm. Mm. Ooh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
{\an8}-What are you...? Stop that.

-Oh! Oh, sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<line>
{\an8}Forgot where I was for a second.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<line>
{\an8}-Think this'll help?

-Kid's got the right idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<line>
{\an8}We can chuck the choker

and spook her with this poker!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<line>
{\an8}-Show her who's boss!

-[Sarah Lynn] Ruffle her feathers!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<line>
{\an8}[Corduroy] Get her to the kitchen!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<line>
{\an8}[grunting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<line>
{\an8}And that!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<line>
-All right!

-[Herb] Go!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<line>
[Crackerjack] Ha-cha!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
-[Sarah Lynn cheers]

-[all whooping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<line>
Yes, yes, BoJack bullied a bird.

Bully for him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<line>
Speaking of useless,

my husband is running late,

so we're gonna start dinner without him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<line>
He'll be here before the show starts,

won't he?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<line>
{\an8}He'd better be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
{\an8}In the meantime,

let's adjourn to the dining room

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<line>
{\an8}before our dinners get

as cold as my parenting style.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
[all laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<line>
[Sarah Lynn] I think mine would be

the first time someone asked

for my autograph.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<line>
-Really?

-Oh, wow!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
I didn't even know how to write my name!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<line>
I just drew a squiggle!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<line>
-Water?

-Thank you, Zach Braff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<line>
You only get to give

your first autograph once, you know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
The second time it becomes an obligation,

the third time a chore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
But the first time...

[sighs] The first time... [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<line>
-Hey. What is that?

-Ah, ah, ah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<line>
Shh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<line>
-[BoJack] Mm.

-Okay. My turn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
Mine was also when I signed

on a dotted line to enlist.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<line>
Are you ready to sing "The Lollypop Song"

in the big show later?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<line>
No, Mom.

You know I never make it to the show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
I didn't know then that enlisting

would lead to my two worst parts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<line>
You have two?

I didn't know we could pick two.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<line>
Corduroy, it's a conversation,

not an assignment.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
-[Corduroy] In that case, I have three.

-[Herb] Three is way too many.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
My worst parts were saying goodbye

to my mother

and seeing a bullet go straight

through my general's face,

right before it hit my own.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
-[all gasp]

-At least your death was instantaneous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<line>
I can still hear the loud drips of my IV

from when I had cancer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<line>
-Drip. Drip.

-Ooh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
-[Corduroy] What about you, BoJack?

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<line>
Best part, worst part, what about you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<line>
Well, I guess my worst part

has to be, um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
Right before I got here, I think? Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
I went to Angela Diaz's house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
[gulps, spits] Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
Does anyone else's water

taste like chlorine?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<line>
Hey, Braff, can I get

some different water over here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<line>
Right away, Mr. Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<line>
Crackerjack, do you think your death

meant something

because it was in the service

of a greater cause?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
-Aw, shucks.

-Of course it meant something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
I think questions like that are too big

for a little soldier like me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<line>
My brother gave the ultimate sacrifice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<line>
-Because sometimes I wonder--

-But see, this is where I get hung up,

because when we valorize

the idea of sacrifice,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
-of loss, of suffering--

-BoJack, don't start with this again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<line>
When we grow up

in a house that does that,

we internalize this idea

that being happy is a selfish act,

but sacrifice doesn't mean anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
-[Sarah Lynn] Yes, it does.

-Sacrifice?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<line>
In the service of something greater,

maybe, but just in and of itself?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
-What's the good in that?

-A lot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<line>
Sacrifice is good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
It has to be because I sacrificed a ton,

and I was freaking awesome.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
Oh, and what did you ever sacrifice?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
I gave everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
I gave my whole life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<line>
You died in a hedonistic bender.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
I'm not talking about my death.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<line>
I'm talking about my life.

I gave my whole life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<line>
If we get into everyone's whole life,

we're gonna be here all night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<line>
It's called "Best Part/Worst Part,"

not "Everything That Ever Happened."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<line>
Okay, worst part:

the 2007 "Sexually Confident Virgin Tour."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<line>
My manager leaked nudes

to get more tour dates added,

my mom pointed out every carb I ate,

it was hell.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<line>
But it gave millions of fans

a show they will never forget.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<line>
And that is worth something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<line>
No, that's a high you chase.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<line>
-It was not.

-You think you singing songs on stage

is the same thing as this guy

who died liberating the camps?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<line>
We don't need to compare

apples to Auschwitzes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<line>
Herb, tell 'em. It means something--

the work we do, the joy we bring.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<line>
It has to, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
Boy, I sure thought so.

I-I used to really believe in it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<line>
I mean, I was one "trapped in an airport

during a snowstorm

on the eve of the dance championship

guest starring Gregory Hines" episode

away from an Emmy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
Then I lost it all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
Ow! Seriously, is no one noticing

this leak?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<line>
Fine, we'll get a bucket.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
-The drips are hitting me!

-Then you'll hold the bucket.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<line>
But the funny thing is,

it wasn't until I got fired

that I actually became myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<line>
I was out of the closet. I was free.

I was authentically me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<line>
What does being authentic

have to do with anything?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<line>
Well, when I wasn't hiding

behind some facade, I could be at peace.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<line>
That's when I really got

into philanthropy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<line>
-Can I ask you something, Herb?

-Why do people say that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<line>
If you're asking it, then yes,

you can and you will and you just did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<line>
Yeah, why are we announcing our questions?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<line>
-Yeah, what are these questions, royalty?

-[imitates fanfare]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<line>
Announcing King and Queen Query

of the Interrogative Isle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<line>
May I ask you how do you do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
-Very well, thanks.

-Ah, bup, bup, bup!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<line>
I didn't ask you yet.

I asked if I could ask you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<line>
Did you get pleasure

from your charity work?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
Like real, deep pleasure?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<line>
It dwarfed every other joy in my life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<line>
Doesn't count then.

If you got pleasure, it wasn't selfless.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<line>
And it's only good if it's selfless.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<line>
Who made up that rule? I helped people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<line>
Who cares if it made me feel good, too?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<line>
Feeling good is inherently selfish.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<line>
If I'd given myself to Christ,

truly went down the path--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
I don't care for this talk of religion

in my house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
If I wasn't constantly

trying to feel good, get it better,

always looking for maximum pleasure...

[sighs] That was my worst part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<line>
Well, one of the three worst parts.

Wait, actually, can I have four?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
Discovering you in your trailer

definitely cracks my top five.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<line>
This is bullshit!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<line>
I did a lot for a lot of people!

I was not a bad person.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<line>
No one is accusing you

of being a bad person, Sarah Lynn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<line>
[yelling] You are! You all are

with your "being authentic"

and "charity work" and "killing Nazis."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
I actually never killed a Nazi.

All my kills were friendly fire.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<line>
I also never liberated any camps.

I'm honestly not sure what I did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<line>
Here you go.

Your husband just pulled up, ma'am.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
Wait, Dad's here?

He's never made it to dinner before.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<line>
-Hey, here's a question.

-Another question has arrived!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
Did any of you have a song of yours

played in outer space?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<line>
Anyone? No. Just me? Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
That's what I thought.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<line>
My hit single "No, No, No (No Means Yes)"

is making its way to Mars!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
That means something.

I will be remembered.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<line>
-That has to mean something. I will be--

-[door opens]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<line>
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss the show?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<line>
-Hey!

-There he is! There's our guy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<line>
-Dad!

-I...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<line>
Oh, you didn't miss a thing.

It's not like we have anywhere to be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<line>
Why shouldn't we all bend ourselves

to your schedule?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<line>
I already apologized. I was running.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<line>
Yes. As always, running late,

while I was running myself ragged

trying to get dinner on the table.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<line>
-[clears throat]

-Yes, you helped.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<line>
And now I'm running out of patience

for you running your mouth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
And I'm running out the clock

until we both...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
Well. Here we are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
I'll just squeeze in here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<line>
-Get yourself something nice.

-Ooh! Thank you, Mr. Secretariat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
-What'd I miss?

-We're playing Best Part/Worst Part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<line>
Ooh! I got one! Machu Picchu.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<line>
When I left "Horsin' Around,"

I honestly thought about killing myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<line>
Shit, Herb. Really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<line>
Yeah. But the Knicks

were having a good season

and I wanted to see what happened.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<line>
Wait, you didn't kill yourself

because the Knicks

were having a good season?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<line>
What would you have done

if they were having a bad season?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>
I don't know. Gotten into baseball?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<line>
Oh, for the love...

Where's your follow-through?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<line>
It's like you didn't even

wanna kill yourself!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<line>
And I'm so glad I didn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<line>
Because there I was ten years later

at Machu Picchu

and I realized there was so much more

I could do in a life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<line>
Okay, my turn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<line>
August 22nd, 1973,

I was banned from running ever again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
And running, well, that was the only thing

that ever made sense to me,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<line>
-so if I couldn't do that I was nobody.

-[coughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<line>
-This is your worst part?

-Best part: jumping off that bridge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
-Jesus.

-What did I say about the Jesus talk?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<line>
It was my choice.

I got to go on my own terms.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<line>
Not a lot of people can say that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<line>
-No.

-That's true.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<line>
The view from up there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<line>
-Eh, you wouldn't believe it.

-[coughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
-[all laughing]

-Oh, my.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<line>
-It must've been from swimming earlier.

-Oh, you were swimming?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<line>
Yeah. I, um... [clears throat]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<line>
-When was I swimming?

-Don't think about that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
-Do you have a best part?

-Oh, uh, I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<line>
This past year I took a teaching job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<line>
And I had this one student

who was really struggling,

just couldn't get over this hump.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<line>
And what, you helped him

do good in a scene? For your class?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<line>
That's the best part of your whole life?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<line>
I don't know, I was just spitballing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<line>
I didn't know you were gonna put me

on the spot like this!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<line>
Come on, buddy.

What was so special about that moment?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>
It felt good to help someone do something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
See? Helping someone, like I said!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
But he liked it because it felt good,

like I said!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<line>
I liked it because it reminded me

of when I was young, just starting out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
You and me, screwing around,

hitting up open mics.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<line>
Trying to figure it out. I think...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
-I think that was the best part.

-Really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<line>
Well, are we ready to start the show?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<line>
-[Corduroy] Let's do this!

-Okay, nice seeing you all!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<line>
You're not coming?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<line>
This is always the part where I wake up.

You all go to the show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<line>
Zach Braff says "Pardon my reach"

even though he can clearly

get my plate from another angle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<line>
-Then I wake up.

-Oh, okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
-Next time then. [sighs]

-[dripping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<line>
Pardon my reach.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<line>
Hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
[Herb] Hello, everyone!

Please take your seats.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
Tonight's show is in honor

of BoJack Horseman!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<line>
What do you say, huh?

Should we get this show started?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<line>
Yeah! Tonight's opener

needs no introduction,

but I'm gonna give her one anyway.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<line>
Ladies and gentlemen,

the one, the only, Sarah Lynn!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<line>
-[audience cheers, applauds]

-Thank you, thank you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
I'd like to dedicate tonight's performance

to the man of the hour, BoJack Horseman!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<line>
Sarah Lynn, I'm so sorry

for everything that happened with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<line>
With us. I should have protected you...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
Ah, ah, ah. BoJack. This is my time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<line>
Yes. Of course. Sorry.

</line>

-Shh.

-Try to enjoy the show.

<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

Down in front, please?

<line>
All right,

let's keep this show going, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<line>
Next up, you know him, you love him,

please a give a warm, warm,

burning hot welcome to...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<line>
-Hey. You wanna grab a smoke?

-...Zach Braff!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
-Yes. Yeah, let's get out of here.

-[audience cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<line>
[Zach] Oh-ho, whee! I'm honored.

Honored, honored.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<line>
So, what's on the other side of that door?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<line>
The nerve of that guy.

With the beard. Herb?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<line>
Yeah. Herb.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />

<line>
What, he says he's at peace?

'Cause why, Machu Picchu?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
-I don't buy it.

-I don't know. I... I believe him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<line>
I promise you,

every single person in that room

would go back if we could.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<line>
Peace? That's someone

trying to convince himself of something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<line>
-Of what?

-That life has meaning or purpose, that...

that if you check the right boxes

and do the dance,

then you get a little parting gift

at the end,

a framed certificate that says,

"Congratulations, you've got peace."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<line>
[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<line>
-I wouldn't mind that.

-But guess what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
All the time those people spent,

trying to do good or help people

or be something?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<line>
I did none of that shit,

and yet here I am, same as them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<line>
You were the fastest runner in the world.

You inspired millions.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<line>
And yet, here I am, same as you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<line>
So, if you could go back, do it again,

what would you do different?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<line>
[sighs] What would I do?

I wouldn't have cared so much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<line>
Cared about what? Racing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<line>
About everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<line>
I know this part is confusing

because I'm Secretariat

and also your dad for some reason,

but speaking as your dad,

it's important that you know that I cared.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<line>
No. You never cared.

You cared about your book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<line>
You cared about getting drunk

and telling everyone

how miserable you were,

but that's not caring.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<line>
You think I didn't care

because I put up walls,

but I cared so much, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<line>
About you, about your mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<line>
I wanted you to respect me.

I wanted you to love me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<line>
I was so afraid that you would know that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<line>
I cared so much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<line>
It's a shame that we could never

talk like this in real life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<line>
All the good it would have done.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<line>
Least we got the chance this time,

before I wake up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<line>
[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<line>
Wake up?

Oh, you're not getting it, are you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<line>
Getting what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<line>
Loss is a collaborative art,

between the people who leave us

and those who remain.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<line>
We dance with the shadows

of their absence.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<line>
-With that in mind, I present to you...

-[grunts] Stop the show!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<line>
-Excuse me.

-What's happening?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<line>
You're being very rude.

I was about to do my roller-dance routine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<line>
-Calm down, son.

-Yes, why don't you sit down, and--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
-No!

-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, no. Please!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<line>
I'm not ready. I never got to direct

my <i>Backdraft</i> remake:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:32" />

<line>
"Zach Braff's Backdraft"!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<line>
I never finished my memoir:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<line>
"I Started A Zach Which Started

The Whole World Braffing!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<line>
I need to wake up. I can't be here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<line>
Of course. Everything's always about you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<line>
-BJ, buddy...

-Herb! How did I get here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<line>
How the hell should I know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
I broke into my house.

But it wasn't my house anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<line>
I was... I was watching

the "Horsin' Around" Blu-ray.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<line>
Yes. Yeah, and I drank some more

and I found some pills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<line>
And then I went swimming...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<line>
No! No! No! No, wait, wait, wait!

I got out of the pool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<line>
Yes! And I called Diane!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<line>
BoJack, we're trying to do a show here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<line>
But I called Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<line>
I couldn't have drowned

if I got out of the pool to call Diane!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
So, I shouldn't be here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<line>
[stammers] If I could just finish

the conversation. Where's a phone?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<line>
[pants]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<line>
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

we have a real treat for you next.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<line>
A real treat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<line>
Come and see him

before he makes a run for it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<line>
-No! Stop!

-It's Secretariat!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<line>
Stay calm. Flyin' off the handle

won't change a thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<line>
This was gonna happen to you

one of these days.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<line>
A poem. Original, obviously.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<line>
It's called "The View from Halfway Down."

[clears throat]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<line>
"The weak breeze whispers nothing

The water screams sublime

His feet shift teeter-totter

Deep breath, stand back, it's time

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<line>
Toes untouch the overpass

Soon he's water bound

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<line>
Eyes locked shut but peek to see

The view from halfway down"

[audience applauds, cheers]

</line>

I'm not done. Hold on. I'm not done.

I'm not done. [clears throat]

<line>
"A little wind, a summer sun

A river rich and regal

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<line>
A flood of fond endorphins

Brings a calm that knows no equal

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<line>
You're flying now

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<line>
You see things much more clear

Than from the ground

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<line>
It's all okay, it would be

Were you not now halfway down

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<line>
Thrash to break from gravity

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<line>
What now could slow the drop?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
All I'd give for toes to touch

The safety back at top"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<line>
I change my mind. [stammers]

I change my mind. I don't wanna--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<line>
It's okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<line>
"But this is it, the deed is done

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<line>
Silence drowns the sound

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<line>
Before I leaped I should have seen

The view from halfway down

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<line>
No! I really should have thought

About the view from halfway down"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
Find your peace, big guy. Find it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

"I wish I could have known

About the view from halfway down--"

[BoJack gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<line>
I need to get out of here!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<line>
-Wha--

-BJ, where do you think you're going?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<line>
Nothing you do in here matters, pal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<line>
Yelling and struggling isn't gonna

pull your body out of that pool,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<line>
-so you might as well just--

-Sit down! [echoes]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<line>
But I...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
Look, BJ, it's possible that someone

is going to find you and save you,

and it's also possible that someone won't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<line>
We don't get to know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<line>
Can I ask you a question?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<line>
[imitates fanfare]

</line>

<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<line>
BJ, there is no place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<line>
It's just your brain going through

what it feels like it has to go through.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<line>
All you can do right now

is sit back and enjoy the show.

Golly.

And now the easy part.

Wow. Beatrice Horseman, huh?

You know, she was gonna sing

for us tonight,

but apparently, she was a little "horse."

It's... BoJack Horseman!

Is it terrifying?

<line>
No. I don't think so.

It's the way it is, you know?

Everything must come to an end,

the drip finally stops.

See you on the other side.

Oh, BoJack, no, there is no other side.

Diane, you're gonna save me, right?

I called you

and you're coming to get me?

-So, what do I do now?

<i>-BoJack, it doesn't matter.</i>

</line>

<line>
Well, if it doesn't matter,

can I stay on the phone with you at least?

<line>
<i>Okay.</i>

</line>

How was your day?
