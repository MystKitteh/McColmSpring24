<line>
What are you doing here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<line>
{\an8}You said if I was in town

to give you a call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
-Wanna get a drink?

-It's eight in the morning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<line>
It's 5:00 p.m. in Los Angeles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<line>
-That's not true.

-I don't know what time it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<line>
When's the last time you slept?

You look like shit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
Really? 'Cause you look like a million...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<line>
-Yeah, let's get you back to my place.

-What about the store?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<line>
What if somebody has an emergency

and they need more...

turquoise shit?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<line>
It's New Mexico.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<line>
They'll find it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<line>
-It's really good to see you.

-It's good to see you, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<line>
I can't wait for you

to meet Kyle and the kids.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<line>
Kyle and the kids? Please tell me

that's the name of your band.

So, who are you again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>
You were friends with Mom

when she lived in L.A.?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<line>
{\an8}Your mom never mentioned she used

to hang out with <i>the</i> BoJack Horseman?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<line>
{\an8}Star of screen and... book?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<line>
{\an8}-Wait, Mom lived in Los Angeles?

-Never came up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:33" />

<line>
{\an8}-All these years?

-It was a long time ago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, gross. Mom, Trip has a boner again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<line>
{\an8}-Trip.

-Trip, let's dial back the boners.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<line>
{\an8}-Gross.

-What? I can't help it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<line>
{\an8}-Trip, ew.

-You are at the breakfast table

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:43" />

<line>
{\an8}with your parents, your big sister,

and an old man.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:46" />

<line>
{\an8}-What could possibly be arousing you?

-Am I the old man?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

<line>
I don't understand how it works.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:51" />

<line>
I was just excited that I finished

the maze on the back of the cereal box.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<line>
So, BoJack. What brings you to Tesuque?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<line>
So, we're just gonna change

the subject

and pretend Trip isn't being a huge perv

right now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<line>
Yeah, Penny, that's the plan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:03" />

<line>
Talking about it makes it worse.

It likes attention.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:05" />

<line>
{\an8}Charlotte told me if I was ever

in New Mexico

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<line>
{\an8}-I should call her.

-But what are you doing in New Mexico?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<line>
-Yeah, what <i>are</i> you doing in New Mexico?

-I, uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<line>
You didn't drive all this way

just to see my mom, did you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<line>
[laughs] No, of course not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:18" />

<line>
That would be crazy,

to come all this way just to see a woman

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:22" />

<line>
I haven't had a real conversation with

in 30 years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:25" />

<line>
-I mean, obviously, that would be crazy.

-Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:28" />

<line>
-Because she has a family, which is great.

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:31" />

<line>
-You guys are great.

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<line>
So, I'm just here to, you know, say hello.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:36" />

<line>
-Mm.

-On my way to see...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:39" />

<line>
-On your way to sea?

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:40" />

<line>
To the sea. To the shining sea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<line>
Because I'm here to buy... a boat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<line>
-At the... Santa Fe Boat Show.

-I've never heard of a Santa Fe Boat Show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:49" />

<line>
{\an8}That's 'cause... it's a secret boat show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:51" />

<line>
{\an8}-Invitation-only.

-Huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<line>
{\an8}Mostly athletes and visiting dignitaries

and big-time celebrities and... kings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<line>
{\an8}-Wow.

-[Penny] Hold up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<line>
{\an8}If you live in Los Angeles,

which is right on the ocean,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<line>
{\an8}why would you drive all the way here

to go to a boat show

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:04" />

<line>
{\an8}-in the middle of landlocked New Mexico?

-Jeez, so many questions.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<line>
What is this,

<line>
{\an8}Oh, gotta take this.

It's my... boat... guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<line>
-Hello?

-Okay, so I got Turtel--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<line>
Hey, Knute.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<line>
-You got any leads for me, boat-wise?

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<line>
{\an8}Sounds perfect, Knute.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<line>
{\an8}-Now tell me, do we need a poop deck?

-Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<line>
-Well, if Leo has one, then I want one.

-BoJack--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<line>
{\an8}In fact, I want two, two poop decks.

Sorry about that. What's going on?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<line>
-Where the hell are you?

-Tesuque.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<line>
-Te-who-ka?

-Tesuque, New Mexico.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
-Outside Santa Fe.

-Are you te-stupid?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<line>
If you don't get your ass back te-set,

you're gonna get te-sued.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<line>
-Just get me a couple of days.

-For what? What are you doing there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<line>
{\an8}I don't know, I just... [sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<line>
{\an8}This isn't what I expected.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<line>
Well, I can probably stave them off

till Monday if you get pinkeye.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<line>
-Can you get pinkeye?

-I have to go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<line>
Wait, BoJack, when are you coming back?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<line>
{\an8}Soon. Yep, I want the starboard

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<line>
{\an8}-to be fully starboard.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<line>
-And the port to be... also starboard.

-Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<line>
-Thanks a lot. Goodbye.

<i>-Wait, BoJack--</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<line>
-Hey.

-I'm really glad you're here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<line>
Oh, yeah... uh, me, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<line>
I hope this isn't weird for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
You know, me having a family and--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
Why would it be weird? [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<line>
At our age,

it's weird if you don't have a family.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<line>
-I mean...

-Well, not for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<line>
-No.

-'Cause you've been busy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<line>
-Right.

-With your career.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<line>
Sure, yeah,

my career has kept me super busy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
Anyway, I know you're just in town

for the boat show,

but seriously... make yourself at home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<line>
I really don't want to impose.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<line>
If there's anything I can do

to help around here--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
Mom, Dad was supposed to take me driving

after school today,

but now he's gotta take Trip

to his dumb-ass basketball game.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<line>
-It's the quarter-finals.

-You'll just get a hard-on in the game.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<line>
Now I will get a hard-on because

you made me think about it. Thanks a lot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
-I'll take you driving this weekend.

-I need to practice every day.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
I'm the only senior

who still doesn't have a license.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<line>
It's embarrassing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<line>
Well, I got the store,

and I already took the morning off,

so unless you know any other adults...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
Can BoJack take me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
-Huh?

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<line>
-I mean, he is an adult.

-Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<line>
Well, I mean, if it's okay with BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
You'd really be doing me a huge favor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
Well, I guess I could make some time...

before the boat show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
Keep your eyes on the road,

both hands on the wheel.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<line>
-Okay.

-And don't text and drive,

unless it's an emergency,

like you have a really funny thing

that you just have to text someone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<line>
-Got it.

-So, let me ask you something. Tsk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
Do your parents really love each other,

or is it

a stay-together-for-the-kids situation?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<line>
What? Why would you ask me that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<line>
I don't know. Just making conversation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
-Why do we keep passing the same house?

-No, I don't. Shut up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<line>
You shut up. What's the story?

Cute guy live there? Girl you hate?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<line>
College kid that gives you Adderall?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<line>
Okay, fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<line>
That's Diego Mendoza's house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<line>
He's just this stupid guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
He's in my calculus class,

and sometimes we'll do this thing

where he goes, "Hey,"

and then I go, "Hey."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
Then he goes, "What's the homework?"

and I tell him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
It's not like a big deal or anything,

but it's like this thing we do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
-Cool thing.

-So, anyway...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>My best friend, Alison F.</i>

<i>was talking to Rachel Kaplan.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
{\an8}[BoJack]<i> Do I really need</i>

<i>to know these names?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<line>
{\an8}[Penny]<i> Rachel heard from Ray-Ray</i>

<i>and the Bean</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>that Diego said</i>

<i>if prom happened right now</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>he'd want to go with Ali Sandler,</i>

<i>and I'm like,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<line>
"Yeah, pfft, okay, dude."

You know what I mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<line>
You know I don't know

any of these people, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
But then he said

since prom's not for another two months,

he could "foresee a situation"

where he would want to go with me,

because he knows I'm a real girl

who's mostly chill. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<line>
If you're so mostly chill,

why do you keep driving by his house?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
In case he comes out,

to, like, check the mail or something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<line>
I'll get out of the car and be like,

"That's so funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<line>
I was just going for a drive."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<line>
And he'll be like, "Oh, hey."

And I'll be like, "Hey."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<line>
-'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.

-That's the whole plan?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<line>
Well, it's better than your plan

for buying a boat in New Mexico.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<line>
Dude, what are you really doing here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<line>
[BoJack sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
I didn't... like the person I was in L.A.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<line>
And I didn't know where else to go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<line>
-Please do not tell your parents.

-Well, I won't,

but I think people are gonna notice

if you go to a boat show

and don't come back with a boat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<line>
[BoJack sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
Oh, my God, there he is. Get down!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<line>
-Oh, my God. Oh!

-What are you doing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<line>
-What happened to your plan?

-Oh! I panicked.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<line>
I didn't know

he'd be wearing a tank top. [screams]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<line>
-Don't tell my parents I crashed your car.

-Yeah, deal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<line>
-They didn't even put me in.

-[sighs] I'm sorry, sweetheart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<line>
You did some great cheering

from the bench,

and for someone who never plays,

you sweat a lot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<line>
-Maybe they'll put me in next game.

-Sure, they will.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<line>
[whispering] No way they'll do that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<line>
[truck beeping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<line>
-[Kyle in normal voice] What the...?

-Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
-Whoa!

-Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
What a boat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<line>
-Can I go on your boat?

-I don't see what's stopping you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<line>
Yeah! Woo-hoo! I'm going on a boat!

I got my way!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
Where's your car?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<line>
I junked it.

Who needs a car when you got a boat?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<line>
-Uh... well--

-[Trip] Whoa, sweet, a waterbed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<line>
On a boat!

Think of the amount of floating!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<line>
Please stay out of the bedroom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
-Does she have a name?

-Who?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<line>
-The boat? It does not.

-Come on. You gotta give her a name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<line>
You should call her the <i>Escape From L.A.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<line>
That actually is a good name for <i>it,</i>

the nongendered object.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
Oh, she's a good girl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<line>
[chuckles] I can tell,

she's a good girl, isn't she?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
-Or are you a bad girl?

-Are you flirting with my boat right now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<line>
No, just kidding around.

I'm kind of the comedian of the family.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<line>
-Mind if I get on top of her?

-Knock yourself out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<line>
Dad, don't be gross.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
-Wow, you really got a boat.

-Yeah, sure did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<line>
So, does that mean you're leaving?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<line>
Oh, I, uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<line>
Yeah, I guess, uh... I guess I did...

do what I came here to do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<line>
You don't have to go right away, right?

At least stay till the end of the weekend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<line>
-Yeah? I don't wanna put you out.

-Oh, it's no bother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
And at least now you have your own bed.

Besides... heh, everyone here loves you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<line>
Uh, everyone?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<line>
[Kyle] Don't use the bathroom.

It'll end up in the driveway.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<line>
-[Trip] Too late.

-Seriously, stay as long as you want.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
[cell phone rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<line>
-What?

-BoJack, great news.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
Do you still want to go to New York?

Because Jill Pill--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
Jill Pill? I don't care about this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<line>
Okay, moving on. Do you remember

when we were at Herb's funeral

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
-and you told me--?

-Whatever it is, I don't care.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<line>
[Trip] Oh, there's a kitchen!

Can we make pizza bagels?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
[Kyle] Yeah, family dinner on the boat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<line>
[family laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<line>
Hey, uh, I'm not gonna be back

on set Monday.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<line>
What? How long do I have

to keep putting out fires for you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<line>
I don't know, Princess Carolyn.

Just let them burn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<line>
-What?

-I think I might be here a while.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<line>
<i>Listen, I--</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
Well, who's getting seasick? [retches]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<line>
[family laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<line>
Just kidding. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<line>
It's such an eyesore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
Well, I'm sure if we ask them nicely,

they'll move the boat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<line>
[husband sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<line>
BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<line>
-Yeah?

-Supper's ready.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
So, I had another meeting today

with the Drama Chair at SFCC.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<line>
They're gonna offer me a position.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<line>
-What? That's amazing.

-Oh, that's cool. Congratulations.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
There's a real stick-in-the-mud dean there

who doesn't like my in-your-face style.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
If I know me, it might lead

to some pretty zany misadventures.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<line>
Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<line>
It's funny you brought up the Brussels

sprouts, because I think they're terrible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<line>
[Kyle snorts, then laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<line>
I'm just kidding around.

These are great, hon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<line>
[all laugh]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<line>
Penny, did you hear my bit

about the Brussels sprouts?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
A <i>bit</i> is what they call a <i>joke</i>

in show business.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<line>
-Right, BoJack?

-That's right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
String a bunch of those together

and you got yourself a riff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<line>
[groans] You're not funny, Dad.

Your jokes are never funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<line>
Okay... I think someone's in a mood.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<line>
Oh, my God. I'm not in a mood.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<line>
Whatever. Get bent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
I hate my life. I can't wait to be dead.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<line>
[door slams]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
[BoJack and Charlotte] I'll talk to her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
Everyone said for months

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<line>
-that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
-But he keeps not doing it.

-That is so typical Diego.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<line>
So, I thought, okay,

if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<line>
-Way to take initiative.

-Oh. Rookie mistake.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
So, I asked him and he said no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<line>
And then this other girl, Lyla K.,

came up to him and was just like, "Hey."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<line>
And he was like, "Hey."

And that's our thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<line>
Well, I don't want to tell tales

out of school,

but this Lyla K. character

sounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
Thank you, that is exactly what she is.

It's weird that nobody talks about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<line>
Well, you know, sometimes it's nice

to not have a date,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
-because you can actually--

-Mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
I can't go to the prom without a date.

It's not like when you were in high school

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
-and you'd go to your sock hops.

-Do you think

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<line>
-I went to high school in the '50s?

-Penny, hey, I got an idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>
-You should take me to the prom.

-Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<line>
Everybody loves having BoJack around.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<line>
What? Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<line>
Think about it. If you went with Diego,

you'd be nervous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<line>
<i>"Does he like me? Am I cool?"</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<line>
<i>But with me you can just relax</i>

<i>and enjoy yourself.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
<i>Diego will see you</i>

<i>have a good time without him,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<line>
<i>and that'll make him super jealous.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
<i>So, he'll come up to you,</i>

<i>and he'll say, "Hey."</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<line>
<i>And then you say, "Hey."</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
-Oh, that's so cold.

-Right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<line>
-Wait--

-Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<line>
-How is that cold?

-Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<line>
<i>And you'll say,</i>

<i>"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<line>
<i>And then... never dance with him.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<line>
-That'll show him.

-Wait-- I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<line>
-Don't you want to dance with Diego?

-Stop poking holes, Charlotte.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<line>
-This is a great plan.

-Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
Hey, Dad, BoJack's taking me to prom!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<line>
Oh, [chuckles] yeah, well,

that's definitely the better idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<line>
[Kyle] Okay, everyone smile. Real big.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<line>
-[all] Cheese.

-I think we have enough pictures.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<line>
Oh, come on, it's your first prom.

Indulge us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
Taking pictures before prom

is so bourgeois.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
And who are you again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<line>
-I'm Maddy.

-Maddy's my best friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<line>
-I thought Alison F. was your best friend.

-That was like three best friends ago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<line>
[snickers] You were best friends

with Alison F.?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<line>
-No.

-Hey, BoJack, I'm Pete.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<line>
But they call me Pete Repeat

because I always say everything twice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<line>
-Everything?

-Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
-Okay.

-Ah, damn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<line>
I forgot to say that twice, didn't I?

Usually I do it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
Cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

are already posting pics on Instagram.

<line>
-What?

-Hashtag much?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<line>
Let me see.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
Whoa, hold on. Responsible adult.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<line>
-What are you drinking?

-Nothing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
-Hand it over.

-[scoffs] Fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
Ugh. Red Bull and vodka? What are you, 12?

You'll get sick drinking all that sugar.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<line>
Do they teach you anything in school?

Make a left at the light.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<line>
-Where are we going?

-I'll get you some bourbon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<line>
And you'll cut it with water.

That way you don't get hungover.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<line>
Wait, really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
If you're gonna drink,

you should be smart about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
Awesome. Wait.

How many times did I just say "awesome"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<line>
Was it twice or was it once?

Ah, it was probably twice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<line>
Yeah, it's twice. Pete Repeat.

Well, more for me.

<line>
This prom is really bourgeois.

<line>
-Lyla K. is so pretty.

-Shut up. She's got nothing on you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

We gotta get this party started.

<line>
-Hey!

-What's the big idea?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<line>
Why is there an adult

at our high school prom?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<line>
All right, folks.

We're taking it back to 1991,

when a new funky-fresh dance craze

took this nation by storm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<line>
-All right. [chuckles]

-I'm listening.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<line>
As a teen, I'm open to new experiences.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<line>
Ready for the chorus, stay on the beat,

and here... we... go. Waka waka.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<line>
Now boys and girls,

if you wanna do the BoJack,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<line>
-take your hands and put them on your--

-Boo!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<line>
-This sucks.

-This guy's bad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<line>
God, no! This is not

the immediate praise I expected.

</line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<line>
This prom sucks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
You can say that again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<line>
-I know.

-[slurring] My flask got empty.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<line>
Can we be back to the car,

so, for more get for put in it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<line>
Or we could go back to the car

and just leave.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
-You can't just leave the prom.

-Of course you can. You're young.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<line>
You can do whatever you want.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:53" />

<line>
That's what they never tell you

until it's too late.

You don't have to be here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<line>
Yeah, is right. Society is everywhere.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<line>
-Society.

-Well, what else are we gonna do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<line>
I'd say it's time to get down,

time to hit the town.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
Is that a lyric

from that "Do the BoJack" song?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<line>
Just get in the car.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<line>
[Penny laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<line>
Okay, one... two... three.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<line>
[Penny] Wow. That is so beautiful.

</line>

[Maddy burps]

<line>
Hey, you wanna climb up

on the water tower?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<line>
We could see the whole city.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:34" />

<line>
Yeah, I wanna go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

-[Maddy vomits]

-Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<line>
Oh, careful there, Maddy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<line>
Actually, I'm gonna stay right here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<line>
This is nice.

<line>
[both grunting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<line>
Wow, how'd you think to do all this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<line>
I don't know. It just came to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
I'm really glad we left that stupid prom,

but I'm kind of bummed

we didn't get to dance.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<line>
Well, you wanna dance?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<line>
Yes, hold on.

<line>
It's buffering.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<line>
Buffering still, buffering.

<line>
This night has been... so perfect.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<line>
You know, you look just like your mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<line>
[Pete] Guys?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<line>
I think you should come down here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<line>
She's still breathing,

but she won't wake up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<line>
She just had too much to drink.

Take her back to your place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<line>
-She can spend the night.

-Maddy, come on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<line>
No, look, my cousin had a friend

who passed out like this,

and she died of alcohol poisoning, man.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<line>
I really think we should get Maddy

to a hospital, to a hospital.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<line>
Did you see what I did there?

That's why they call me Pete Repeat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<line>
BoJack, what do we do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<line>
[tires screech]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<line>
-Society.

-Careful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<line>
-I'm being careful.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<line>
-Lock the wheels.

-Watch her head.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<line>
Maddy's gonna be just fine.

They'll know what to do here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<line>
Pete, you're in charge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<line>
-Penny and I are gonna take off.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<line>
You don't want too many people around

in a hospital setting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<line>
If anyone asks,

tell them we left the dance early,

and you don't know

where Maddy got the whiskey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<line>
Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<line>
It's one thing if a bunch of kids

get drunk on prom night,

but if there's an adult there,

I was supposed to be responsible,

and then the whole thing feels

kind of creepy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<line>
Are you sure she's gonna be okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<line>
-I don't know, BoJack.

-Pete.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<line>
I'm the adult here,

and I need you to listen to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<line>
Penny and I left early.

You don't know who gave Maddy whiskey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:24" />

<line>
Are we clear on this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<line>
I need you to be 100 percent with me here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<line>
Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
Just listen to him.

He knows what he's doing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<line>
It's gonna be okay.

Where did Maddy get the alcohol from?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:32" />

<line>
[Maddy groaning]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<line>
I... I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<line>
And what happened to your friends

BoJack and Penny?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<line>
[sighs] They left early.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<line>
See, that's not so hard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<line>
You're doing the right thing.

Don't forget that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<line>
[Pete sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<line>
-Okay.

-Is it okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<line>
Or "okay" okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<line>
-Uh... "okay" okay.

-All right, that's what I thought.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<line>
You're the future of America!

Go, Penny! Go, go, go!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<line>
[tires screech]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
-She's gonna be okay, right?

-She'll be fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<line>
It's a part of growing up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<line>
And we did the right thing back there,

you think?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:07" />

<line>
I... [sighs]

Look, sometimes when you're an adult,

the right thing

isn't always the best thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<line>
Well...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<line>
I had a really good time tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<line>
Even with all the craziness.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
This was really special.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<line>
I'm glad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<line>
You know, everyone always treats me

like a kid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<line>
You're the first grown-up I've ever met

who actually treats me like...

you know, a person.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<line>
So, thanks. Mwah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />

<line>
-Well, you're welcome, Penny.

-Mm--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<line>
-Whoa, Penny, come on.

-If you want to do it, I'm ready.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<line>
I have condoms in my room.

I can put one on with my mouth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<line>
-With your mouth?

-I put one on a banana in health class.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<line>
With your mouth?

What kind of health class--?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
Look, you are an amazing person,

but you're 17.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<line>
Which is the legal age of consent

in New Mexico.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<line>
Okay, that's not--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<line>
And I didn't drink tonight,

so everything's totally legal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<line>
-Penny, no.

-It's okay. I want this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<line>
No, you think you do, but...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<line>
You don't know what you want.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
Oh, God. [sniffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<line>
This is so dumb.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<line>
-No, Penny, don't--

-I'll see you tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<line>
Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<line>
-What'd you do with my daughter?

-She had a big night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<line>
She was falling asleep on the ride home.

Where are the boys?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<line>
Trip's at a friend's house

and Kyle's asleep.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<line>
-You know you can get your own, right?

-Hey, do you remember that time

you, me and Herb let those balloons go

over Studio City?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
Oh, yeah. Didn't we attach glow sticks

to them or something?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<line>
-Yeah.

-Ooh. That was really bad

for the environment.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<line>
-True, but--

-A seagull could've choked

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<line>
-on one of those balloons.

-But it's a nice memory, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<line>
It was a fun night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<line>
We had a lot of fun nights.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<line>
Before you left town,

you told me L.A. was a tar pit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<line>
-Do you remember?

-Oh, God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
I said so many things when I was young.

I thought I was so deep.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<line>
-Well, do you still think it's true?

-Do I think L.A. is a tar pit?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<line>
No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<line>
No, I think you're the tar pit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<line>
-Me?

-No, not "you" you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<line>
I'm just saying, like...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<line>
It doesn't matter where you are,

it's who you are,

and that's not gonna change

whether you're in California

or Maine or New Mexico.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<line>
You know, you can't escape... you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<line>
-Ugh. Now you sound like my mother.

-No, what? No, I don't. [laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
[Charlotte sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
-I don't know what to do, Charlotte.

-About what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<line>
I keep... making these bad decisions.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<line>
-And hurting people.

-Well...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<line>
-Can I tell you a joke?

-Is it a long joke with no punch line?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<line>
-No.

-Then go ahead.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<line>
Guy goes into the doctor's office.

Says, "Doctor, it hurts when I do this."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<line>
You know what the doctor says?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
-"Don't do that."

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<line>
-That's actually... good advice.

-And you know what else?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<line>
The doctor in that story was a woman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
What?!

</line>

<line>

<line>
Oh. BoJack, um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<line>
-I think you got the wrong idea.

-Let's go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<line>
-Let's get out of here right now.

-No, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<line>
You and me, this is real.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
-You know this is real.

-My husband is right upstairs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
I don't care about your husband.

All that matters is us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<line>
-Don't do this, BoJack.

-I know you feel it, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<line>
So many times in my life

I've done the wrong thing,

but this is the right thing,

and I have never been more sure

of anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<line>
I've wasted so much time sitting

on my hands

and imagining what could have been.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<line>
Tell me you don't feel the same.

Tell me you haven't thought about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<line>
[Charlotte sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<line>
-I think you should go.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<line>
-Tomorrow.

-Charlotte--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<line>
I have worked very hard to build this life

for myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<line>
I am happy here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<line>
And you just roll into my life

like a hurricane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<line>
Why? Because we knew each other

for five minutes 30 years ago?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<line>
-I don't know you.

-You do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<line>
I don't. And you don't know me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<line>
No, please.

These last few months have been amazing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<line>
-I love you, your family and this town.

-Stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<line>
-I never wanted to hurt--

-BoJack--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<line>
I'm sorry I kissed you. I shouldn't have.

We can pretend it didn't happen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<line>
-Everything can go back to normal, but--

-No, no, stop. No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<line>
Please, don't make me go back to L.A.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<line>
I don't care where you go, BoJack,

but I can't have you around here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<line>
You make me too sad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<line>
What are you doing here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
I know what I want, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<line>

<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<line>
-Charlotte.

-Penny, go to your room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<line>
-We didn't even do anything.

-Now, Penny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<line>
-Charlotte, I am so sorry--

-Don't. Don't you dare.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<line>
If you are not out of my driveway

in 30 minutes, I will call the police.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<line>
And if you ever try to contact me

or my family again,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<line>
I will fucking kill you.
