<line>
[Sarah Lynn]

<i>Okay, one more song.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:10" />

<line>
<i>I'm gonna slow things down.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<line>
[music stops abruptly]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
Sarah Lynn is very tired.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<line>
Can you just tell her BoJack's here?

Horseman. I'm an old friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
Well, I'll tell her, but...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<line>
[groaning]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<line>
[Sarah Lynn]

BoJack? Oh, my God! Bring him in!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<line>
-I can't believe you came to my concert.

-It was incredible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<line>
When you sang that one ballad

and shot fireworks out of your boobs,

that was such a moving tribute

to gays in the military.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<line>
We are going out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<line>
Before you go, I need you

to sign these posters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
It's for charity.

Doctors Without Posters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<line>
Okay. BoJack, can you

hang out for a minute?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<line>
-Yeah. I'm not going anywhere.

-Also, we have those radio records,

and you're doing the print ads

for Sarah Lynn's Stank,

the new fragrance from Kevin Kline.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
-You mean Calvin Klein.

-Kevin Kline, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<line>
He's the only man who truly

understands my fragrance.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<line>
I'll come back in 20 for those posters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<line>
Oh, my God. Being famous is the worst.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<line>
-Ugh! Yeah, you're telling me.

-No, but, like, really famous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<line>
-Uh...

-How can I explain it to someone like you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<line>
I feel like all my friends only like me

because I'm Sarah Lynn, you know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>
-Nobody cares about Sarah Lipschitz.

-Who's Sarah Lipschitz?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<line>
The lawyer who helped me change

my name from Sarah Helmulfarb.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<line>
Oof!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<line>
It is so great to see a real friend

who knew me before I got huge

and isn't just trying

to get something out of me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<line>
Right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<line>
I swear you are, like,

the only one I have left.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:37" />

<line>
I am this close to falling off

the deep end. [laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<line>
I know I'm smiling right now,

but the light inside me is dying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<line>
Uh, what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<line>
But here I am blah-blah-blah-ing

about my own boring, sexy, thrilling life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:48" />

<line>
What is going on with you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<line>
Well, actually, I'm doing this new show,

<i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<line>
-I don't know if you've seen it or--

-Ugh, I'm so busy with the tour.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:57" />

<line>
Yeah, no, of course, no,

but it's been a lot of fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:59" />

<line>
The ratings aren't great,

but we have this upcoming episode,

and we're looking

for a really big guest star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<line>
Oh. You want me to be on your show?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<line>
Well, I just thought it would

be really fun for... the both of us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<line>
You know, like the old days.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:19" />

<line>
I have the script with me

if you want to take a look at it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:22" />

<line>
Um, okay. Why don't you put it

on that pile over there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:25" />

<line>
And I'll get to it

when I have some free time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:27" />

<line>
-Over here?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:29" />

<line>
I'd love to keep hanging out,

but these doctors need their posters,

and I'm already pretty exhausted.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<line>
You should probably go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:34" />

<line>
-Oh, okay.

-It's all very exhausting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />

<line>
Thanks again for coming.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<line>
Like I said, it's always nice

to see a... you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:42" />

<line>
Yeah.

</line>

Day 75 at sea: there's a darkness

brewing on the horizon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<line>
I feel it. What say you, skippy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<line>
[Todd's voice] <i>I think you got a touch</i>

<i>of the ocean madness, Margo.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<line>
And I think you got a real smart mouth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
You want another night in the box?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
<i>No, anything but that!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<line>
Then quit your yappin'

and fix Mama a Sazerac.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
{\an8}Hey, is that character actress

Margo Martindale?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
{\an8}She's on the FBI's Most Wanted list

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<line>
{\an8}and the AV Club's list of 20 actresses

that always make everything better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<line>
{\an8}-We gotta call this in, right?

-That depends.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
{\an8}Are we professional blimp pilots,

or are we casting directors?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<line>
{\an8}Blimp pilots, sir.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<line>
{\an8}Then we're not being paid to discover

underutilized character actresses.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<line>
{\an8}We're being paid to pilot this blimp.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<line>
<i>Hey, Margo, do you see something</i>

<i>out there across the water?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
Yeah. What is that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
[choking]

</line>

<line>

<line>
{\an8}[British accent]

All clear from here to Los Angeles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
{\an8}[British accent]

We've hit a few delays,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<line>
{\an8}but you'll get your precious cargo

by tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
{\an8}[Italian accent]

Tomorrow?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<line>
{\an8}But the big opening

of my restaurant is tonight!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
{\an8}How can I offer the real Italian cuisine

without my real Italian spaghett'?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<line>
{\an8}Spaghett' is how Italian people

say "spaghetti."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
{\an8}We'll get you your pasta.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<line>
{\an8}Better do what he says.

He might have friends in the Mob.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<line>
"Friends in the Mob"?

That is an ugly stereotype.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<line>
[speaking Italian]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
You heard the man.

Set this boat's controls to "faster."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
Aye-aye, Cap'n.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
Oh, I see how it is.

Wanna play a game of chicken, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<line>
<i>I don't think</i>

<i>this is a good idea, Margo.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
Cram it, skip! Those limp dicks

are about to find out

what savvy film and television viewers

have known for years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
Character actress Margo Martindale

ain't afraid of nothin'!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
{\an8}The boats are about to collide!

We have to do something!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<line>
{\an8}You know damn well,

when we took to the sky,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<line>
{\an8}we made a solemn oath never to meddle

in the affairs of land nor sea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<line>
We are sworn but to observe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
This is the blimper's promise.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, no! The boats

are tearing each other apart!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
{\an8}Crates and crates of spaghetti

are pouring out into the ocean!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
I'm watching the same boat collision

you are. You don't need to narrate it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
[screaming]

Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<line>
No! Skippy!

He was too pure for this world!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<line>
Oh, no!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<line>
The pasta is cooking!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<line>
If only we had some olive oil

to reduce the stickiness.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<line>
But olive oil doesn't actually

reduce the stickiness in pasta.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<line>
That's only a myth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<line>
No! I've wasted so much of my life

stirring olive oil into pasta!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<line>
Disaster <i>al dente</i>

off the coast of San Clemente!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<line>
Twelve tons of pasta

have leaked into the ocean,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<line>
{\an8}and the massive carbo load

is heading straight to Pacific Ocean City.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<line>
{\an8}[screaming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<line>
{\an8}Joining us via Google Hangout

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<line>
{\an8}is spaghetti scientist Carla Hall.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:01" />

<line>
{\an8}-What can you tell us, Carla?

-Well, Tom, as the spaghetti cooks,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
{\an8}it will expand, smothering the town

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<line>
{\an8}and tenderly broiling the sea life

who reside there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
Is there any way to prevent

this delicious-sounding

environmental catastrophe?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
{\an8}The only hope for rescue would be

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<line>
{\an8}if someone had an enormous quantity

of spaghetti strainers

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<line>
{\an8}just sitting around the house,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
{\an8}but that person would also need

access to a fleet of drivers

to transport said spaghetti strainers,

and in order to strain

the spaghetti fast enough,

the drivers would also need to be

incredibly strong swimmers,

like, just as an example,

hot, sexy killer whales.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<line>
Is there such a savior

who could possibly fit

that ridiculously specific

set of criteria?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<line>
{\an8}I don't know, Tom, but as they used to say

on my favorite TV show, let's find out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<line>
A movie, during the day? Dare I?

</line>

-Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<line>
And, now, to turn my phone off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
If anyone needs me in the next two hours,

they'll just have to wait.

Yes, but this objectification of women

ended up saving lots of lives,

many of whom were also women,

so, therefore, not sexist?

Why don't you give her my info?

Maybe that was the problem!

-All this time, I thought I was an agent,

but what if what I was really

supposed to be was a manager?

</line>

<line>
-What's the difference?

-It's a completely different line of work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<line>
An agent helps a client find jobs,

but a manager helps manage

a client's career.

-It sounds exactly the same.

-I think I'm having an epiphany.

the wrong bra size this whole time.

Oh, you do not need

That's all this needed to be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<line>
Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
This is for eight million dollars.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<line>
Well, you are a one-third owner.

What did you expect?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<line>
Todd, as a millionaire?

That'll lead to some interesting stories.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<line>
What an exciting development.

How's that gonna change the dynamic?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<line>
-I guess we're gonna find out, right?

-You can leave now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<line>
Hooray! Todd's in the one percent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

Julia, this ice cream is only for girls

who try on their roller skates.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<line>
-So, what do you say?

-Uh, I'm gonna swipe left on that idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<line>
-[audience laughing]

-Cut! We got a lighting issue.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

-Hey, Chloe, that was really funny.

-Thanks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<line>
-Are you having fun?

-Mm-hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
-You got any friends in the audience?

-No friends, but my mommy and my daddy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<line>
Oh. You want to know a secret

about your mommy and daddy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<line>
-What?

-They are really proud of you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<line>
Oh, I know that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<line>
What do you want to be

when you grow up, Chloe?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<line>
What do you mean?

I want to be like you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<line>
-Like me?

-I want to be famous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<line>
Oh, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
-BoJack?

-[stammering] Oh, God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<line>
-Is everything okay?

-I can't be here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<line>
I can't do this again. This isn't right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<line>
-What do you mean?

-I need to go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
We need to shoot the rest of this episode.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
I'm sorry. I just-- I don't belong here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
Where are you going?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
I don't know.

<line>
["Stars" playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<line>
So, what are you gonna do

with your eight million dollars?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<line>
First, I'm gonna get a really fancy hat,

like, really fancy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<line>
Then, I'm gonna get a T-shirt

that says, "Hey, look at my hat."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<line>
-[both laugh]

-What about you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<line>
I've always wanted to go

to a super nice restaurant

and order everything on the menu.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<line>
Oh, yeah! That's, like,

first day millionaire stuff.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<line>
We should go sometime, together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<line>
-Todd, can I ask you something?

-Of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
What's your deal?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
I feel like you like me,

but you don't like me,

but you like me,

and I don't know what that is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<line>
Are you gay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<line>
-Whoa. Why would you even--?

-You can tell me if you're gay. It's fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<line>
This isn't the 1600s,

or some places in the present.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<line>
I'm not gay.

I mean, I don't think I am,

but... I don't think I'm straight, either.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<line>
I don't know what I am.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
I think I might be nothing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<line>
-Oh. Well, that's okay.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<line>
Yeah, of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
[Southern accent]

Thank you so much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
Oh, crap! I accidentally tipped

the waitress eight million dollars!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<line>
Well, guess I'm broke again.

</line>

-[doorbell rings]

-Who could that be?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<line>
Pizza?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
Katrina, you're not pizza.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
Ugh. This fight again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<line>
Listen, butt-sniffer, I work for a guy

and we're looking for a guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<line>
You're supposed to be this big hero now,

so someone brought your name up

in a meeting,

and, now, I have an opportunity for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
Oh, is it being married to you again?

Because I'd rather get euthanized.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<line>
Spoiler alert from <i>Marley &amp; Me.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<line>
That wasn't a spoiler until you said

the name of the movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<line>
If you've got a gig for me,

you can go through my new manager.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<line>
Oh, I'm not talking about a gig.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<line>
Then what are you talking about?

Oh, my God, this is so classic Katrina!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
How would you like to be the governor?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<line>
Whoa.

</line>

-Of California?

-Yes, of California.

Who's at the door? Is it pizza?

Welcome back.

Your first meeting's at 10:00,

and you have a lunch at 11:30.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<line>
-Thank you, Judah.

-Also, I have someone on line two

trying to get in touch

with BoJack Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<line>
I have no idea how she got this number.

It sounds like it's a teenage girl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:44" />

<line>
Tell her I don't work for BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<line>
Mm-hmm. I'm sorry. We can't help you.
