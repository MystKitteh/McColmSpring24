<i>You got to get your shit</i>

<i>together.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:08" />

<line>
So you took some licks,

but you're gonna bounce back,

because you're talented,

you're smart,

and damn it,

you're good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
You are a goddamn American

treasure, you know that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<line>
You are BoJack goddamn

Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
So get the hell off my lawn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
Here I thought I was at the

drive-through at Carl's Jr.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<line>
How much did I have to drink

last night?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
Last night?

Oh, you've been on a bender

for the last two weeks, ever

since you found out Diane

got engaged

to Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<line>
Diane got engaged

to Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<line>
- I need a drink.

- No. No more drinking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<line>
You've been out of control.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn, look.

I met John Stamos.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<line>
That is not John Stamos.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<line>
Hey, Princess Carolyn,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<line>
John Stamos and I

got our ears pierced.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<line>
That is not your ear.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn,

John Stamos died.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<line>
Why?

Why, God?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<line>
Why did you take John Stamos?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
That doesn't sound so bad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<line>
Oh, I forgot to mention you

were naked for a lot of that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<line>
Stamos!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<line>
Also, it wasn't here.

It was at my office.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<line>
We thought night swimming

would be fun,

but the current

was too strong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<line>
Oh, God, I wasn't

driving around, was I?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<line>
No. You made Todd

your designated driver,

but then you also made him

drink with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>
Yeah, I'll have

a western bacon cheeseburger.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<line>
BoJack, we are going

to get you back on your feet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<line>
All you need to do

is get off Diane

and get on to something else.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<line>
- [line rings]

<i>- Hello?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<line>
Tony, hi.

I'm calling in that favor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<line>
Get your crew

to BoJack Horseman's house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<line>
Can you be there in an hour?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:37" />

<line>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

- Great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:39" />

<line>
What just happened?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<line>
You're the new face

of Guten Bourbon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<line>
What is Guten Bourbon?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:43" />

<line>
It's an urban German

bourbon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<line>
Am I just hungover, or are

you talking like a Muppet?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:47" />

<line>
They're looking

for American celebrities

to talk about how much

they like to drink.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<line>
It's the part

you were born to play.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<line>
All you have to do is smile

and stay upright.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:55" />

<line>
I don't know.

It sounds like a lot of work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:57" />

<line>
You take up 80% of my time

with your drama

and make me 0% of my money.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<line>
Do the damn commercial.

</line>

<line>
Okay, I got to go.

You're in charge, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:09" />

<line>
Keep this dummy

out of trouble.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:11" />

<line>
Hooray, responsibility.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<line>
- [vomits]

- Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:15" />

<line>
Do you really believe all that

stuff you said to me earlier

about me being smart

and talented and good?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:21" />

<line>
BoJack, I'm an agent.

I believe everything I say.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:25" />

<line>
Ah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:27" />

<line>
Hey, where the hell

is that cheeseburger?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:29" />

<line>
I ordered it,

like, an hour ago.

you skinny bitch.

<line>
{\an8}How the hell are you?

I'm in a hurry,

so I'll make this... snappy.

<line>
{\an8}I got some great news about

the picture

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<line>
{\an8}we're putting together.

<line>
{\an8}- [cell phone rings]

- Sorry. Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<line>
Hey, I just wanted to thank

you for getting me this job

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<line>
{\an8}and pulling me out of that

oh-so-predictably BoJack

- You really are the best.

- I know. Talk to you later.

<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
{\an8}I feel like you see things

in me that nobody else sees.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
Yep, I'm pretty great.

Got to go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<line>
All this time,

I never even--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<line>
BoJack, I'm in a very

important breakfast right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<line>
{\an8}- Okay. I got to go, too.

- Sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<line>
{\an8}What's the great news?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
{\an8}- We got Braff.

- You beautiful dickhead.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<line>
{\an8}You finally got Zach Braff?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<line>
{\an8}Ah, no other director

has enough weight

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<line>
{\an8}to handle a movie about

the last days of Eva Braun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
{\an8}No shit, toots.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

There you go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
Thank you, sweetheart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<line>
{\an8}Everything's coming

together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<line>
{\an8}With Braff directing,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<line>
{\an8}my client Cate Blanchett

starring,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<line>
{\an8}and the great

Lenny Turteltaub producing,

this movie is a done deal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<line>
{\an8}Look, honey, I been in this

business a long time, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<line>
{\an8}Long time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<line>
{\an8}And as I once said

to a young Ed Begley Sr.,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
"It ain't a done deal

till the deals are all done."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<line>
I'm the best agent

in the biz.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
I can seal these deals

with my paws in my pants.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<line>
Well, then I'll say to you

what I once said

to a young Buster Keaton,

"What?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
[jazzy music]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
[overlapping shouting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<line>
Laura!

What's happening?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<line>
- We're merging.

- No shit. With what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<line>
FME. A bunch of people

got laid off,

and some of the FMEers

are already moving in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
It's all so sudden

and unexpected.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<line>
- It was not handled well.

- [laughter]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<line>
Oh, shit. Don't tell me

one of the new agents is...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<line>
Vanessa Gekko.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
That slippery, slimy,

cold-blooded, bug-eyed--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
What's new, pussycat?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
- Gekko.

- In the flesh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<line>
Ha ha. How are you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<line>
What a morning, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<line>
I was in the middle

of my second soul cycle class

when I got the news.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<line>
- Can you imagine?

- No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<line>
I was so excited,

I rushed home,

made love

to my husband of 15 years,

made a hot breakfast

for my three wonderful girls,

read to them, dropped them off

at their elite private school,

and then got my ass here

as quick as I could.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
- Um, how old are your kids now?

- I don't have any children.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<line>
Oh, well, it'll happen.

You're still...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<line>
- Anyway--

- Princess Carolyn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<line>
I see you've already met

a new member of the team.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
- Vanessa Gekko, sir.

- I know that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<line>
This merger is very exciting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<line>
- I'm pumped.

- I'm beyond pumped.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
You should be, or at least

I think you should be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
It's hard to keep track

of who's getting promoted

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
- and who's getting fired.

- Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
You're probably fine or not.

Who knows?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
[cell phone rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<line>
Ugh.

What do you want, Todd?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<line>
Well, good news, bad news.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<line>
The bad news is that there

actually is no good news,

and the other bad news

is BoJack's gone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<line>
What? Where did he go?

The shoot is at his house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<line>
He just disappeared. I don't

even know why he'd leave.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<line>
This charcoal mellowed bourbon

is so smooth,

every time I take a sip,

pure happiness.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
- That was amazing.

- Really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<line>
Can I get you to say that

in a tuxedo?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<line>
Hey, I got to go.

I think this is my big break.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<line>
Don't worry. I won't let it

get to my head or anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<line>
Hey, who told that asshole

he could sit in my chair?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<line>
Don't forget I'm your agent, too!

I want 10%.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<line>
Hello, beautiful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<line>
What the hell

are you doing here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<line>
You're supposed to be

shooting a commercial.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<line>
I know, but I was sitting

there drinking bourbon and--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<line>
They didn't give you

fake bourbon on set?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
Oh, they did, and then

I just mixed it with bourbon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<line>
And it hit me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<line>
Why was I so upset

about Diane getting engaged?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<line>
You're the one who's always

been there for me,

so I drank a lot more bourbon

and drove over to tell you

how I feel.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
Oh, I see what this is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn,

what are we doing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
Clearly we're in love

with each other.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<line>
You're not in love with me.

You're in love with Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
And you're not even

really in love with her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<line>
You just think you are

because you pay her

to listen to you

talk about yourself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<line>
Diane getting engaged

was the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<line>
It made me realize you're

the one I need to be with.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<line>
Ha! You say that every time

something bad happens.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<line>
Not getting nominated

for a People's Choice Award

is the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<line>
It made me realize--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<line>
Getting caught

with that pound of cocaine

was the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<line>
That hooker getting pregnant

was the best thing

that ever happened to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<line>
Sneezing on Marisa Tomei

was the best--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
Every time

something bad happens,

you come running to me

for comfort.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<line>
Well, it's not gonna happen

this time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
I can't be your agent

and your girlfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:49" />

<line>
- It just doesn't work.

- [knock on door]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
I have Lenny Turteltaub

for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
- I have to take this.

- Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<line>
But remember,

I'm coming for you,

and I'm gonna make you love me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<line>
Please don't.

Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<line>
Bad news, P.C.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
Braff used your merger as

an opportunity to jump ship.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<line>
Aw, fish.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<line>
Now his new agent's

asking for twice the money.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<line>
As I once said

to a young Lionel Barrymore,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<line>
"Eh, shut up."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
Without a director, <i>Eva Braun</i>

is as dead as Eva Braun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<line>
Yep.

You got to get someone big.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
- <i>What about those brothers</i>--

- Hello? Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
Lady, you work too hard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<line>
That was

an important phone call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<line>
Important phone call

beep boop blorp.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<line>
Don't you robot-voice me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn,

what are we doing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<line>
Well, I'm working,

and you are leaving.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<line>
Before I go, I got you

a little sexy something

to remember me by.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<line>
Since we can't be together

every second,

which would be my preference,

I give you cardboard BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<line>
It's got

a light-sensitive sound chip,

so every time you walk by it,

it quotes a line

from <i>Jerry Maguire</i>,

your favorite movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<line>

Pretty sweet, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<line>
<i>You had me at "hello."</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<line>
I don't have time for you

or cardboard you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<line>
I need to find

a new director.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<line>
Or you could find

my nude erector--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
She's gone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

[elevator bell dings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<line>
Blech.

Word to the wise, Laura--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<line>
Do not pitch a Nazi romance

to Steven Spielberg.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<line>
Just thought you should know

there's been some

reorganization

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<line>
- vis-a-vis resource management.

- What are you saying?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
You and Vanessa Gekko

are sharing an office

until they can find her

a permanent one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<line>
- The hell we are.

- Also...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<line>
Good news, Princess Carolyn.

Vanessa's my agent now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<line>
What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<line>
You said you couldn't be

my girlfriend and my agent,

so I'm firing you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<line>
Now we can be in love.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<line>
- Hope you like money, BoJack.

- This is so great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<line>
Now I can date you

and have a better agent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
- Everybody wins.

- Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<line>
<i>I'm a sporting agent.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

Are you still

searching for happiness?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<line>
Make your own happiness.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<line>
Mmm, that's some Guten

Bourbon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
Cut.

That was great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
Was it? You know, I'm trying

to do good work here,

really find the character,

but it's pretty distracting

to have all these robots

staring at me

with their blinking red eyes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<line>
Those are cameras, Todd.

We're making a commercial.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<line>
Oh, well,

you want to make a good one?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<line>
Then get them

the hell out of here!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
I'm the face of this brand,

I'm the man behind the thing,

and I'm determined

to get the jargon

of this German bourbon blurbin'.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<line>
Is it just me,

or does this fake booze

taste a lot like real booze?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<line>
You want BoJack,

you can have him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<line>
Here's a list of directors

who won't work with him,

studios that won't hire him,

former assistants

with restraining orders.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<line>
This is great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
You know,

it gets kind of boring

when all your clients

are in such demand,

they practically

find their own jobs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<line>
Well, then BoJack should be

a lot of fun for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<line>
- No one wants to hire him.

- [knock on door]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
Hello. We're looking

for BoJack Horseman's agent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<line>
We'd like to discuss

a very lucrative business

opportunity.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<line>
- You gotta be kidding me.

- I'm BoJack's agent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
The opportunity

is we're blackmailing you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
Ha. All yours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<line>
Needless to say,

it would be a shame

if these pictures got out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<line>
Fortunately, that can

easily be avoided

by simply paying me

and my partner here $150.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<line>
Each.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<line>
Let me just get my

checkbook.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<line>
Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
- Whoa.

- [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
Oh, except California law

prohibits taking photos

on private property

without a permit,

but you had a permit, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<line>
- Uh...

- What's that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<line>
Oh, also, extortion can be

prosecuted

as a class E felony.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
That's four years

in prison, easy,

and when you throw in

the murder of Tupac Shakur...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<line>
- We didn't do that.

- Yeah, yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
You can't pin that on us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<line>
Well, someone's got

to take the fall.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<line>
- [both gulp]

- Sorry to bother you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<line>
Forget we were ever here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
That was fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
Hey, Laura, send those guys

a nice fruit-and-nut basket.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<line>
You got it, boss.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<line>
Who said you could use

my assistant?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<line>
- I did.

- Oh, hello, Mr. Witherspoon.

<i>weighs 8 pounds?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

Fascinating.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<line>
So sorry we have

to double up on everything

while we work out who goes

where and who gets fired,

but in the meantime,

help yourself to an intern,

one of the rising stars

at our company--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<line>
- Charlie Witherspoon.

- Hello. I-- Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<line>
Sorry, my-- My hands

are really sticky.

</line>

<line>
[glass shatters]

<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<line>
Charlie was the editor

of <i>The Harvard Lampoon.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<line>
He can be Princess Carolyn's

new assistant

while I use Laura.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
- Ugh.

- Good thinking, boss.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<line>
[phone rings]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<line>
Ah, ah, phone is ringing.

Phone is ringing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<line>
What do I do?

What do I do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
I'll take it in here,

Charlie. Hello.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn,

your client is out of control.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<line>
BoJack is not

my client anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
Not BoJack.

Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>
I think someone mixed alcohol

into his prop drink.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<line>
Oh, you pretenders.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
Bourbon is the name

of a county.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<line>
You can't just make bourbon

in Germany.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<line>
That would be like

making Rice-A-Roni

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<line>
- anywhere but San Francisco.

- No, no, no, no, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<line>
- Ugh. I'll be right there.

- Ow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
You got to get

your shit together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<line>
You are a winner, okay?

You are Todd-- Hold on.

<line>
Fish.

Okay, you are Todd goddamn--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<line>
- What's your last name?

- Chavez.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
- Your last name is Chavez?

- Yeah. Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<line>
I don't know,

I just never thought of you

as a Chavez.

Look, I got to go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<line>
I feel like you didn't

really finish the pep talk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
I know, but I got a movie

to put together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
Best of luck.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<line>
Ready for the tagline?

Here's the tagline.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<line>
What the heck is going on?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<line>
"The woman who loved the man

who hated everyone."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<line>
- That writes itself.

- You got to be kidding me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<line>
Hey, where were you?

We looked everywhere.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<line>
You're having the <i>Eva Braun</i>

meeting without me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<line>
I'm so sorry,

but I didn't know what

the protocol was around here,

and these guys were just

champing at the bit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
- We're just wrapping up.

- But Cate is my client.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<line>
Okay, why don't I come

find you when it's over,

and I'll bring you up to speed?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<line>
Is that Quentin Tarantulino?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<line>
Yeah.

I brought him on board.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<line>
You know he's always wanted

to direct a romantic comedy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<line>
<i>Eva Braun</i>

is not a romantic comedy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<line>
Oh, ooh, oh, oh, over-rotate.

Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<line>
I just missed

an important meeting

because I was babysitting

Todd, who's too drunk to work,

because you switched out

the prop bourbon

with the real bourbon.

You are ruining my life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<line>
- Have dinner with me tonight.

- No way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<line>
Come on, just me, you,

and a bottle of Pinot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<line>
Probably more than one bottle

and some entrees.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<line>
And I'll probably get

an appetizer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<line>
I own the restaurant,

so we can go crazy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<line>
- I have to work.

- You don't have to work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<line>
- You choose to work.

- Hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<line>
Why not choose to be happy

for once?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<line>
Mm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:32" />

<line>
[soft piano music]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<line>
When you're writing a memoir,

you spend a lot of time

reflecting on the past.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
I regret not being

a better friend to you

and lover.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<line>
Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<line>
Lover's kind of a weird word,

but thanks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
You want to get out

of this stuffy old restaurant,

get some gelato, and maybe

drive out to the ocean

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:53" />

<line>
- and put our feet in the water?

- That sounds great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<line>
Let me just freshen up

my whiskers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<line>
Great. I'll get the car

and meet you outside.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<line>
You scamper right back,

pussycat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<line>
You look at your reflection

too long,

you might fall in love.

She's gone.

<line>
What do you want, Gekko?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<line>
Well, I was hoping

to talk to you face-to-face,

but I guess you had

to leave work early.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<line>
I left at 8:30.

What is it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<line>
Well, Cate and I

had a really good talk today.

<i>and especially since I'm doing</i>

<i>so much for </i>Eva Braun<i>,</i>

<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<line>
<i>it almost seemed weird</i>

<i>that I wasn't repping her.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<line>
No. No. No, no, no, no.

No, no, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
She and I are both

high-powered working mothers,

so I understand her

priorities,

so she's switching to Gekko.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:34" />

<line>
Wow, being a mom

helped my career?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<line>
I really can have it all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<line>
This isn't fair.

I know everything about Cate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<line>
Her favorite color is red.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<line>
Her favorite book

is <i>Suffragette City.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<line>
Her favorite Spice Girl is Baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<line>
I know all I need to know,

which is that she's beautiful,

she's British,

and she's gonna make me

a lot of money.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<line>
She's Australian, you moron.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

If you need me,

I'll be at work.

that bad, she can have her.

I'm gonna be okay.

I'm gonna be happy.

<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<line>
Are we going to gelato?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn,

what are we doing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<line>
Getting gelato?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<line>
This was a mistake.

I've been acting crazy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<line>
That phone call just

pulled me back to reality.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<line>
You were right.

I don't love you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<line>
You don't love me.

We're just two lonely people

trying to hate ourselves

a little less.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<line>
Maybe that's all

we're ever gonna be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<line>
Maybe that's all we ever were.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<line>
Well, this night took

a turn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<line>
You know the worst part?

I knew this was gonna happen

and I let myself

get excited anyway.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:52" />

<line>
So we agree that this is

on you, then?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
I guess I'll see you around.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<line>
You're not even

gonna give me a ride home?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<line>
Sorry, I think I just

need to be alone right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:07" />

<line>
[tires squealing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<line>
Of course, of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<line>
That's what you get

when you fall for a horse.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<line>
Taxi.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<line>
You got to get your shit

together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<line>
So yesterday, you let yourself

fall in love a little bit,

and you got your heart broken.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<line>
Serves you right

for having feelings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<line>
<i>Starting now, you are</i>

<i>a hard, heartless career gal.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<line>
<i>Go to work, be awesome at it,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<line>

<i>on foolish flights of fancy.</i>

<line>
[cell phone vibrates]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<line>
- Hello.

- I just want you to know I'm fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<line>
Uh-oh. People only say they're fine

when they're not fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
Did I hurt your feelings

last night?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
I'm an agent.

I don't have feelings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<line>
Well, I'm glad you called.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<line>
I think that you had

the right idea yesterday.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
I should be

getting back to work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<line>
Can you get me another job?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<line>
Yeah, well, I'm not

your agent anymore, so, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<line>
Oh, right. Well, just tell

whoever, then.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<line>
- Haah!

- [tires screech]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<line>
Whoa.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<line>
[honks horn]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<line>
Asshole!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<line>
Anyway, I'm off to Malibu

to see Herb Kazzaz.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<line>
He has cancer, which,

as you know, is a whole thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<line>
Plus, he hates me, so I could

really use some good news

at the end of the day.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
Oh, my God,

you're going to see Herb?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<line>
You must be really--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<line>
Nope, don't care.

Not interested.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<line>
[phone beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<line>
Hope you like kicking ass,

Charlie,

because that's all

we're gonna do today.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<line>
My tie got stuck in the

copier this morning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<line>
That's great, Charlie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<line>
If you flip them real quick,

it looks like

the tie is running.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
Hey, Vanessa, your client,

BoJack Horseman, wants a job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<line>
- Good luck.

- Oh, yeah, about that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<line>
Gwyneth came in this morning,

and I wanted to show her

that she was a top priority,

so I shredded BoJack's

contract

right in front of her.

Heh heh

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<line>
What? You just signed BoJack

yesterday.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<line>
I say good riddance

to Mr. Houseman

or whatever

that horse's name is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
It's not like he makes

this company any money,

and he does seem to take up

an awful lot of your time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<line>
<i>I'm from Arizona, Jerry.</i>

<line>
He's kind of in

a bad place right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
You can't just drop him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
The best agent

in this building

couldn't get that guy a job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
The best agent

in this building

got him a job yesterday,

and I could get him a feature

by the end of today.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<line>
If you want to get him

a movie

by the end of the day,

great, do that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<line>
Otherwise, we are washing

our hands of him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<line>
Charlie, I hear NBC picked up

your running tie show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<line>
Congratulations.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<line>
[Charlie] Thank you, Dad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
Hey, Marty,

Princess Carolyn here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<line>
How'd you like to work with

the BoJack Horseman?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<line>
What's that?

You hate his guts?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
What's that?

He's a talentless boob?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
What's that? You'll never

work with BoJack again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<line>
What's that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
You want him to die in

an ass factory warehouse fire,

smothering to death

under a pile of burning asses?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<line>
Well, if you change your mind,

give me a call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<line>
Oh, BoJack, what am I

gonna do with you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<line>
I don't understand

why you're going through

all this trouble for him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<line>
That guy's dead weight,

Princess Carolyn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<line>
If you don't cut him loose,

you're never gonna be happy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<line>
<i>Help me help you.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<line>
That's it.

Of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<line>
Cameron Crow,

you skinny bitch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<line>
You know <i>Jerry Maguire</i>'s

my favorite movie of all time?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<line>
All your films are so human,

which is super impressive

since you're a crow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<line>
Well, my name is

Cameron Crow,

but I'm actually a raven,

so common misconception.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<line>
- Well, whatever you are--

- A raven.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<line>
- I brought you this

- <i>Suffragette City</i>...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<line>
"a coming of age story

about rock music,

being a teenager in the '80s

and buying zoos"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
How have I not

heard of this book?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<line>
You'd be the perfect

director

to make a movie out of it,

and I happen to know this is

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
Cate Blanchett's

favorite book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<line>
I'll bet she'll drop

everything to play the part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<line>
You should give her a caw.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<line>
Okay, I see-- Yeah.

Caw is what crows say.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<line>
Again, I am not a crow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<line>
[jazzy music]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<line>
Cate, listen to me,

you're making a big mistake.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<line>
<i>Eva Braun</i>

is your dream, remember?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<line>
Cate? Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<line>
Cate!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
Oh, no. What happened?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<line>
Did Cate drop out of

your little Holocaust movie

so she could make

my little Cameron Crow movie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
Why don't you go home

and cry about it

to your loving husband

and children?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
Say, which one of you

is overseeing

the <i>Eva Braun</i> package?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<line>
That would be me, sir.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<line>
Vanessa, you really

shat the bed on this one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<line>
Now, are you fired?

Not exactly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<line>
Can you still work here? No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<line>
Lenny Turteltaub

here to see you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
Thanks, Laura.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<line>
So, one minute I'm making

a movie with Cate Blanchett.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<line>
Next, I hear she's doing

a picture with Cameron Crow

about mix tapes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
As I said to Ed Porter

at the premiere of

<i>The Great Train Robbery</i>,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<line>
"Aah, the train's

coming right at me."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<line>
- What the hell is going on?

- I don't know, Lenny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<line>
<i>Eva Braun</i>

was Vanessa's project.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<line>
All that work for nothing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<line>
Now Quentin Tarantulino's

got four arms up my ass

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
'cause he got all excited

about making a rom-com.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<line>
You know what would be

a great romantic comedy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<line>
Remember when that guy stole

the D from the Hollywood sign

so he could propose

to his girlfriend?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<line>
That would make

a great movie,

but who would play the lead?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
Preferably someone

kind of washed up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<line>
You know how much Quentin

loves to revitalize

dead careers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
It's kind of his thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
Well, in that case,

you know who'd be great?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

- Good news.

<line>
You're back in my stable,

and I got you the lead

<line>
What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<line>
I went through hell and back

today, but it was worth it

because I got you a job.

Aren't you excited?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<line>
No. I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<line>
I don't care about that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

you wanted a job.
