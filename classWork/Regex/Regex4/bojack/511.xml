<p>
[BoJack] <i>Previously on</i> Philbert...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<p>
[sighs] Now I see

why they call you "Sassy."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
-Hello, old friend.

-Fritz! But you're dead!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<p>
Dead serious... about haunting you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
[sighs] I haven't had sex that good

since my wife died.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
To be clear, the sex was pre-death.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<p>
Philbert, I don't want to be

one of those girls,

but did you murder your wife?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
How many people are dead because of you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<p>
Those were bad guys!

They stole the mayor's submarine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
Tell me what happened.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<p>
I'm going to the chief!

The whole world's gonna know what you did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<p>
-You can't do that, Marjorie.

-John, it's over. [gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<p>
Fritz, you maniac! What are you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<p>
-What you're too chickenshit to do.

-[gasping] John! Help!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
-Oh-hh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
You shot your partner?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
He was strangling my wife!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
Kiss me, you smart, handsome renegade.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<p>
There's no time for that now.

The nuclear missiles are coming.

<i>Sometimes, even mushroom clouds</i>

<p>
Hey, partner. Looks like you're getting

soft... serve frozen yogurt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:25" />

<p>
[chuckles] Now I continue to see

why they call you "Sassy."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:29" />

<p>
[narrating] <i>It's also been six months</i>

<i>since I told Sassy the truth.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:32" />

<p>
<i>About Fritz. My wife.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:34" />

<p>
<i>And Sassy hasn't turned me in.</i>

<i>I think she likes me.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />

<p>
-[Sassy sighs]

-[Flip] Cut!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<p>
{\an8}-[bell rings]

-[spits] Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<p>
{\an8}BoJack, I told you

not to eat the prop food.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<p>
{\an8}That fake yogurt costs $500 a cup!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<p>
Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<p>
[BoJack] <i>It's been two months since</i>

<i>the first season of</i> Philbert<i> came out.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:53" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>And it's a hit. Which is great for me,</i>

<i>but even better for Gina.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<p>
[camera shutters clicking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:04" />

<p>
{\an8}You know, I've done so many TV shows,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<p>
{\an8}but this is the first one

that's kind of turned me into a star.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:08" />

<p>
It's a big step up from just recurring

on<i> The Cops are Coming,</i>

<i>Whee-oo, Whee-oo.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<p>
{\an8}[BoJack] <i>And the weird part is</i>

<i>I'm not secretly bitter and jealous.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>I like seeing her happy.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<p>
<i>But I still have this little rancid itch</i>

<i>saying something isn't right.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
<i>It's like there's always something</i>

<i>lurking just beyond the horizon.</i>

<p>
{\an8}Philbert the Troubled Detective.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<p>
{\an8}I see. Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<p>
Why do you still use a landline?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<p>
{\an8}[Philbert] <i>What am I supposed to tell her,</i>

<i>I'm just an old-fashioned guy?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Or maybe I like things</i>

<i>that are plugged to the wall?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Something to grab onto</i>

<i>if I start floating away.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
That was my wife's landline.

<p>

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
-I'm so sorry.

-Never mind that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<p>
The chief's been murdered.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<p>
{\an8}Oh, Philbert, that's awful.

I know you didn't want him to be murdered.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
{\an8}Sassy, put on some pants.

You've got a sweet bottom,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
{\an8}but the only bottom

I'm interested in right now

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<p>
{\an8}is the bottom of this case,

and getting to it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
{\an8}Because this time, it's personnel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<p>
-Cut!

-[bell rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
Did you want me to say,

"This time it's <i>personal"?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
No, that's a cliché.

You're saying it's an inside job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
Someone on the force.

"This time, it's <i>personnel."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<p>
-Ah, okay.

-The strangling looks fake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
Ooh, maybe it would be scarier...

[wailing] if I talked like this--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
{\an8}I already told you. No spooky voice!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<p>
{\an8}I can roll my eyes back

and stick my tongue out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<p>
[gagging]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
-Eh...?

-Yeah, let's try that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
{\an8}Gina, you noticed anything funky

about these new scripts?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<p>
{\an8}Yeah. Without Diane around to police

Flip's use of the word "literally,"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<p>
{\an8}you'd think "the literally store"

was going out of business. Figuratively.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
{\an8}What? No. I mean the story with the chief.

I think it's stolen from my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<p>
I mean, I also had a male boss who died.

Herb Kazazz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
Seems like a coincidence.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
The chief is named Basil.

Like basil, which is an herb! Like Herb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<p>
I don't think anyone would use a story

from your life without telling you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
-Diane would.

-She's not writing on the show anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
You think Flip read her book?

Wait a minute. "Her book." "Herb... <i>ook."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<p>
-What's going on with you?

-I'm gonna get to the bottom of this

because this time, it's business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
<i>Personal </i>business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
-[typing]

-[knocking on door]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<p>
Hey, friend.

Where'd you get your ideas from?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<p>
I'm just-- I'm so interested

in your process.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
Do you make them up,

or get inspired

by other things or people's... lives?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<p>
What are you accusing me of?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
You think I can't come up

with my own ideas?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<p>
Those popsicle guys signed a release.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<p>
Popsicle guys?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
-What are you talking about?

-What are <i>you </i>talking about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<p>
[both] Hmm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
[BoJack] <i>Something's going on.</i>

<i>I must be singing a song called "Crazy"</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<p>

<i>like a patsy.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
<i>All I know for sure</i>

</p>

<p>
<i>Something about "popsicle guys."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<p>
-Hey, buddy. Is everything okay in here?

-Yeah, fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<p>
Really? Because this trailer belongs

to Stingray Liotta.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
[gurgling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
Oh. Uh, I guess I've been

a little distracted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<p>
Are you sure you're okay?

Because you're my friend,

and I would never forgive myself

if something happened to you

that affected our ability

to stay on schedule.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
-What?

-BoJack, I care about you,

and also the 218 other people

who will be out of a job

if you spin out like you usually do.

Now are you keeping things together?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
I'm not gonna screw up

this professional opportunity for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
Your concern is very touching.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<p>
-What's in those pills you keep taking?

-If you really cared,

you should've been there

the day I fell off a building?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
But no. You had other important business

to attend to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<p>
-BoJack--

-You're doing a great job,

making me feel like you give a shit.

You're gonna be an awesome mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
[sighs] I think you're overworked.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
Oh, for real?

With a side order of,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
"Ya think?"

And sundry retorts of that fashion.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<p>
Here's what's gonna happen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<p>
You're gonna take

the rest of the night off.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
You're gonna get some sleep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
And when you come back,

you're gonna be professional,

you're gonna be courteous,

and you're gonna have your shit together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<p>
Fine! And... I'm sorry,

about the mom thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
Get some sleep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
-I can't sleep.

-Ugh. Yeah, you mentioned.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
-Flip was acting very suspicious.

-He sure was. Eight hours ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
But we're home now,

and it's 4:00 in the morning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn's getting

all up in my business!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
She told me that I seem "not okay,"

and was "spinning out,"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<p>
-and "would make a great mom."

-Not sure you'd be the best mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<p>
-I'd be a wonderful mother!

-Wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

-Uh...

Okay, I'm gonna level with you.

I'm in a real situation here

because I did not realize I was supposed

to sell ads for this show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<p>
Nobody specifically told me

that was under the purview

of the president of ad sales!

<p>
So, if anyone wants to buy

30 million dollars'-worth of ad time,

or work out

some sort of licensing arrangement,

basically, what you need to know about me

is I am desperate

and will say yes to anything.

<p>
Uh, no, nothing came today!

I wasn't looking at anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<p>
Why are you so insistent

that something came today?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
Obsessed with things coming much?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
<i>Gina's newfound happiness.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<p>
<i>I gotta find out who sent this.</i>

<i>For her sake.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<p>
This case is like the movie,

<i>Love Actually.</i> No leads.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<p>
-Hope the coroner can help us out.

-She will.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<p>
We got a lot of history,

me and the coroner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<p>
Here's a picture.

She used to be one of my closest friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
Used to?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<p>
Times change.

<p>
[splatters]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<p>
[BoJack] Diane! Diane! Diane!

I know you sent me the note!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<p>
-What note?

-What <i>note?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
The one you slipped under my door.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
See, great actors embody their roles,

so I've picked up some detective skills.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<p>
That letter "I" is in a nerd font.

I'd say it's from<i> The Believer.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
And you're the only person

who reads<i> The Believer.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
First of all, <i>The Believer</i>

is a very popular $12 magazine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
And I didn't send this dumb note.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<p>
You love revealing my secrets.

And not sharing your cobbler!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<p>
-[sighs]

-Who else could have done it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<p>
I don't know.

Who'd you piss off?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
[thinking] <i>She's right.</i>

<i>Lotta people have it out for me.</i>

<p>
Hey, Philbert. This your friend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
-[gasps]

-A second strangling victim.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
If it's the same killer,

he's a real pain in the neck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
Hey, there's being sassy,

and there's going over the line

with humor. Literally.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<p>
All right, enough chokes.

Let's put together a list of suspects.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<p>
Yeah, suspects.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>

Huh.

No. Don't call Charlotte.

That's a terrible idea. Don't do it.

<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<p>
All right, you get another second here.

What's going on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
-I'm doing a survey for the cable company.

<i>-All right.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<p>
I've got time for a survey.

Kinda fun to think

big-time corporations care

about what little old Kyle thinks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
[speaking with mock Scottish accent]

On a scale of one to ten,

how would you rate your cable service?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<p>
Oh, that's a tough one, right off the bat.

Let's see.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
Don't take this personally,

but I'm gonna say eight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<p>
And on a scale of one to ten,

how is your marriage?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
Well, that's a little personal,

don't ya think?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
Oh, okay. Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<p>
But I guess if it helps your survey--

my wife and I had some rough patches,

but we're stronger

now we've got through them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<p>
-I'm gonna give us an eight.

-Okay, so it sounds like your wife

isn't obsessed with a desire

to exact revenge on a former friend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<p>
-What?

-For cable-related reasons or otherwise?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
-I don't think so.

-Okay, wonderful.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<p>
On a scale of one to ten,

how would you rate

your daughter's sexual maturity?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<p>
-Boy, that's a sticky one.

-I'm just reading what's in front of me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
Pfft. I don't even know how to judge that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<p>
Uh, let's say

that one is, "Horribly scarred

by an older man she trusted

and is now dedicated to getting

the word out about the bad thing he did,"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<p>
[normal voice]

and ten is, "Slowly explored her body

in a healthy way on her own timetable

and is now completely emotionally

well-adjusted?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<p>
I don't know, maybe eight?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
I feel like I'm kind of defaulting

to eights.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<p>
-Okay, thanks, bye!

<i>-Wait! Don't go. I got a couple questions.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
Question number one.

What channel is Netflix?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
Gotta get back to Scotland.

You're the man now, dawg.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
Well, that didn't pan out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
We got no leads,

and the Olive Garden won't deliver.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<p>
Sure, when you're there, you're "family."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<p>
There's gotta be something we're not

seeing. All these victims, strangled.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<p>
Yeah, this case just gets

strangler and strangler.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
You made puns!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
You could laugh after two murders.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
But now we're talking about eight

innocent people killed in five days!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
This guy's really going full throttle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<p>
[chuckles] I guess it's just funnier

when I do it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
-The point is, we have to stop him.

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<p>
So many people could have sent that note.

Why do so many people hate me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>
Oh, put up a picture of Crispin Glover.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<p>
Apparently, I spilled coffee on his shirt

in a dream he had.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<p>
I'm not sure production assistants

are supposed to help make lists

of enemies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<p>
Hey, if you're gonna whine like that,

put your own picture on the wall too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
Oh, shit, what time is it?

I gotta get to set.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<p>
We <i>are</i> on set.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<p>
Oh, yeah. We are, in fact, on set.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
[buzzing, popping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
[Flip] I'm telling you, BoJack's onto us!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<p>
[Princess Carolyn]

Oh, he's not onto anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
[Flip] I think he knows

about the popsicle guys!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<p>
-Wha--?

-Pickles, about dinner tonight,

am I any network with a show

starring Kyle Bornheimer?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<p>
-Because I have to cancel.

-Shh, shh, shh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<p>
Nothing's wrong.

Just another heavy night of shooting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<p>
-Sha-sha-shh!

-Gotta go! Love you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<p>
-Shh! Shh!

-Love being monogamous!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
-[phone beeps]

-[sighs] Hey, BoJack!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<p>
Look at you, skulking behind doors

with a malevolent aura.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
-Someone is hiding something.

-How did you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
-Did you talk to Diane?

-Yes. I did talk to Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<p>
BoJack, I promise it was a one-time thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<p>
The worst thing that could happen is

if I lost your respect over this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<p>
I couldn't live with myself

if your respect for me fell any lower

than the current level of respect

you have for me,

which as we both know is very high.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<p>
Can we pretend

this whole thing never happened?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
-What whole thing?

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
There's gotta be a simple explanation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<p>
No. I'm telling you,

this whole thing is rotten, Gina.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<p>
-[Flip] You said "Gina" again!

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<p>
You called her "Gina."

The character's name is "Sassy."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<p>
Right. Um, no.

This whole thing is rotten, Sassy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
Whatever it is,

we'll figure it out together, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<p>
-Okay.

-In the morning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

-[pistol clicks]

-[gasps] Fritz!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<p>
We're not so different, you and I.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
In fact, in many ways,

you might even say we're the same.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<p>
Samie, samie, samie-same,

you might say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<p>
Twinsies, even.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
-Fritz, you're not real.

-Does this feel real enough for ya?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<p>
[grunts] You don't have to do this.

You can trust me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<p>
I do trust you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<p>
But I don't trust <i>her.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<p>
-[grunts]

-Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

Literally.

<i>he won't tell me. And he's not alone.</i>

<p>
This whole show is designed

to reveal my secrets and destroy me.

<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
And poor Gina is caught up in the madness.

I have to find a way protect her! Get it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<p>
Everyone's evil.

It's a conspiracy to destroy you.

</p>

<p>
Protect Gina. Got it.

<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
What...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
I really think we should get to set.

<p>
-Aren't we on set?

-You're at home.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
I came to get you

because you didn't show up at call time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
Why didn't you come earlier? [gasps]

Are you trying to take me down, too?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<p>
Down... to set.

<p>
Hey, everyone!

BoJack's here, ready to shoot!

</p>

<p>
-What are we waiting for? Come on.

-All right, set it up!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<p>
BoJack, what's going on with you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
I can't tell her the truth.

She's safer knowing nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<p>
-You realize you just said that out loud?

-Oh. Sorry. Too many night shoots.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<p>
It's so hard to lie to her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
You just said that out loud, too.

You do know this is real, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<p>
More real than you even know, dollface.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
Face. Clocks have faces.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<p>
That's it! [gasping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
Where the hell is he going?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
[muttering] Gotta get 'em...

Gotta go. Gotta catch up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<p>
-[yelps]

-Todd Chavez. The man in charge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<p>
The guy who has a face,

which is what clocks have,

and also hands, which clocks have, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<p>
I should have known his clocky-handy face

was behind this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<p>
-Hi, BoJack!

-The gif is up, bozzo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<p>
-Spill the beefs.

-Okay, you got me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<p>
In order to offset the costs

of video hosting,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<p>
I needed to sign a licensing deal

with a pharmaceutical company,

but I think this still maintains

the dignity of Flip's original vision.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
"Oopsie, gotta poopsie"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<p>
That sounds like a thing

Philbert would say, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<p>
We're also doing a board game, a lunchbox,

and a campaign with a national taco chain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<p>
The "Philburrito." So zesty,

you'll forget your murdered wife.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<p>
[gasps] So, you wrote the note!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<p>
-Uh, no, that's--

-Tell me the truth, Chavez!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:52" />

<p>
Have you always been

secretly jealous of me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<p>
Did you hate that you were a nothing

and I was a successful cop?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<p>
Did you create this entire

television show to destroy me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>
That's a lotta questions,

but, generally, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<p>
-This ends now.

-Hey, whoa, whoa, careful!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
Ooh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<p>
[beeping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

So, I guess some of this detective stuff

is starting to rub off on me,

because I figured out

what's been going on with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<p>
-Gina?

-I found your stashes

in the toilet paper rolls.

Then I looked around the house

and found all your other

clever little hiding places.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
-How many of these do you take a day?

-Hey. Those are mine. Okay? I need those.

I swear to God,

you try that again and you're dead.

<p>
Sassy, I'm not the bad guy here.

It's Fritz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<p>
I didn't want to tell you this,

but he's back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
I don't know how. Maybe the nuclear blast

resurrected him somehow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
You're my partner. We need to find him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
I'm with Internal Affairs, you moron.

<p>
When you told me Fritz killed your wife,

something didn't add up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
I tried to find Fritz in the system, but

there's no record of him ever existing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<p>
-What?

-In fact,

there's no record of you

ever having a partner at all.

</p>

<p>
What are you saying?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
[grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
You killed your wife. And the chief.

And the coroner. And the others.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<p>
Why would I do that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<p>
Because they knew you,

and they knew your secrets.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<p>
But I know your secrets now.

<p>
Well, I-- I guess

I've been a little distracted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
"Distracted"? You've been high.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
No. It's not high, Gina, that's not--

It makes things normal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<p>
Normal? You're a goddamn mess,

and you're gonna ruin my show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<p>
-Oh, <i>your </i>show?

-That's not what I meant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<p>
No, that's very helpful.

I understand what you're worried about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<p>
-I thought it was me, but it's your show.

-BoJack, listen.

if your show was ruined

by your boyfriend's

debilitating drug problem.

<p>
-Turn yourself in.

I know there's a good man

buried somewhere in there, Philbert.
