[BoJack's voice]

<i>I don't know what's real anymore.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<line>
<i>-And I don't know if I care.</i>

-[buzzing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<line>
-Talk to me, Philbert.

-Don't tell her a thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<line>
[car horn]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<line>
What did you do to your wife?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<line>
-She was gonna get us all killed.

-So you took care of it, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
I tried to stop him!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<line>
-Who?

-Fritz! He was hopped up on goof-berries.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<line>
-[pills rattling]

-Agh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<line>
-I think I shot him.

-[Peanutbutter] Agh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<line>
What are you doing, Philbert? Oh-hh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<line>
You shot your partner?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<line>
[groans] Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<line>
[moans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<line>
-Cut! We're turning around for BoJack.

-[bell ringing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<line>
All right! That was acting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<line>
Hey, so, this has been real,

but since it's our last day,

it feels like maybe we should call it

on the whole us sleeping together thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<line>
I don't usually keep dating co-stars

once we've wrapped.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<line>
Would you say we're<i> co-stars?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
I mean, I'm Philbert.

I'd say we're more like both in the cast?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<line>
Yeah, let's definitely

pump the brakes on this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
And we're set. Action!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
I had no choice.

He was strangling my wife!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<line>
What did you do with the bodies?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<line>
I-- It's all a blur.

It feels like a dream.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<line>
-Where are the bodies, Philbert?

-I buried them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<line>
-In the same place I'm gonna bury you.

-[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<line>
-Right here.

-Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<line>
Kiss me, you smart, handsome renegade.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<line>
There's no time for that now.

The nuclear missiles are coming.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<line>
Cut! That's a wrap

on<i> Philbert</i> Season One!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<line>
Great work, everyone!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:33" />

<line>
{\an8}I want you all to know

I'm proud of what I've done here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:37" />

<line>
-See ya at the Peabody Awards!

-Great working with you. Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<line>
[Princess Carolyn]

Terrific job. Seriously...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<line>
What the hell are goof-berries?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<line>
[theme music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<line>
Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<line>
{\an8}-[chuckles] I love the sign.

-You better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<line>
{\an8}I basically had to go

through a whole pen on that thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<line>
-Uh...

-Hey, I'd help you with your bag,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<line>
-but you know, my back.

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:58" />

<line>
It's cool that you came

through Los Angeles on your way home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<line>
Yeah, I guess we got lucky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<line>
{\an8}The only flight from Connecticut to Kansas

had a one-night layover in California.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<line>
{\an8}-Really?

-No, dummy. I wanted to see you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<line>
-[grunts]

-[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<line>
-[music playing]

-[group cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<line>
[woman on intercom]

<i>Emily is here to see you.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
{\an8}-Blunt?

<i>-Well, she is a little curt.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<line>
{\an8}That's my Emily! Send her in!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<line>
-Hey, Todd. [sighs]

-You okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<line>
-I broke up with my fireman.

-Not Steve!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<line>
No, no, no, not Steve. It was Doug.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<line>
Not Doug! Forgot there was a new one!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<line>
I am so done

with these sexy noble hero hunks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<line>
The sex is great,

but the emotional connection

just is not there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<line>
It was the same with me and Yolanda.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<line>
{\an8}No emotional connection,

but the no-sex was amazing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<line>
{\an8}None of the best sex I ever had.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<line>
{\an8}You know,

I was actually thinking about that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<line>
{\an8}Remember that idea you had

about the dating app for asexuals?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
{\an8}-Nope!

-[phone clicking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<line>
{\an8}Yeah, here we go. <i>♪ Ta-da-da-da! ♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<line>
[Todd] "All About That Ace"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<line>
{\an8}You should get yourself out there.

You were the best boyfriend I ever had.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<line>
{\an8}If only there was a version of you

I could have sex with, I'd be all set.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<line>
-Whoa, Emily. I just got a crazy idea.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<line>
{\an8}A restaurant where the menus

are printed on garlic bread,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<line>
{\an8}so after you order,

the first course is the menu!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<line>
[clock ticking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<line>
So, ever since<i> Philbert </i>wrapped

earlier today,

the question on everybody's mind is,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<line>
"What's Mr. Peanutbutter

going to do next?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
You're a serious actor now,

so I guess, narrate a documentary

about global warming,

and then take a private jet

to the premiere?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<line>
I've been looking for new projects.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<line>
Seems like everything's based

on books these days,

so I went to the book store

to scout some material.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
-Mm-hmm.

-But all the books are so long now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
-Yeah?

-Who has the time?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
I'll just wait 'til the movie comes out,

then see the movie,

and decide if the book the movie

is based on would make a good movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<line>
Oh, that's a good strategy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
Anyway, I was heading to the door

in book-length-related frustration...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
...when I saw

one of those circular greeting card racks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<line>
Spotted a card that looked interesting,

and it's a super-quick read.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<line>
-[flutters]

-Eh...?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<line>
-"Happy Birthday, Dad."

-Pretty cool dad, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<line>
You want to option this greeting card

for a movie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<line>
-We'll call it <i>Birthday Dad.</i>

-But what is it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<line>
Hmm? Mmm... it's... "Birthday Dad."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<line>
Oh. Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
-You think we can get the film rights?

-I'll look into it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
[moans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<line>
[giggles] So, then Joby was like,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<line>
"Uh, nice scrunchie, Professor."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<line>
It was literally a thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<line>
Joby is the guy in your dorm

who plays guitar?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
Yeah, he's really funny,

but like soulful funny, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<line>
-That's great.

-Oh...!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
[BoJack] You know, I always thought

I would make a good college person.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
Roaming the campus,

sticking it to the crusty old dean

with my rowdy 'tude,

having friends, and learning things,

and just, uh, being young.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<line>
-[sighs]

-You okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
You look as if you saw <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>

and you're Scarlett Johansson's publicist.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<line>
It's weird to be back in this house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<line>
This is where it all happened

with your mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<line>
Oh, my God, this is so weird.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
Hollyhock, whoa. It's okay.

That's ancient history.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<line>
My mom is dead, so nobody is going

to drug you with secret pills. All right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
Now, how about we make new, fun, memories

to cancel out the old ones?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<line>
-Can the new memories be pizza-related?

-No doy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<line>
Ah, thank you for meeting me

on such short notice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
It's nice to see you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<line>
I'm sure Fridays

must be a big night for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<line>
You were probably planning on going out

to a nice dinner with your new girlfriend?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<line>
Or seeing a movie

with your new<i> girlfriend?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<line>
Or staying in and watching cable--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<line>
I get what you're asking. The answer is,

no, I don't have cable anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<line>
Oh! [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<line>
Or a new girlfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<line>
I'm not seeing anyone either.

I've just been so busy with my<i> Philbert.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<line>
Philbert? You have a Philbert?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<line>
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a show I'm producing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<line>
Not the baby we really wanted

but never had.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<line>
Oh, well, that's great, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<line>
Anyway, Mr. Peanutbutter wants

to option this card as a movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
<i>-Birthday Dad.</i>

-How is it a movie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
-Hmm. It's "Birthday Dad."

-Oh. Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<line>
-[ringtone playing]

-Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<line>
-I'm sorry.

-Yeah. Sure.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<line>
-[phone beeps]

-Hello?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<line>
[Tracy] <i>Can you get to the St. Bernard</i>

<i>Medical Center in like, a half hour?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
Uh, I think so. Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<line>
<i>I just got my tonsils taken out,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<line>
<i>-and I need a ride home.</i>

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<line>
Nah, I'm just messing with you.

A pregnant lady doesn't want the baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<line>
If you can get there tonight,

the baby's yours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:34" />

<line>
Tonight? That's so--

she doesn't even know me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<line>
Hey, man. You don't say no to free baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<line>
[sighs] Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
Is everything okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<line>
I have to drive my hospital

to the car right now!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
I'm a baby,

and there's adopting on the way!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
-You're adopting?

-Vroom-vroom!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<line>
There's so much food in my lap!

Doesn't matter! It's fine!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<line>
-All part of being a mother!

-You are really freaking out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
Am I freaking out too much? Or not enough?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<line>
-Let me drive you.

-But I have the car seat in my car.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<line>
They won't let you go home without one.

It's the only rule, really.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<line>
There should be more rules,

but who am I to judge?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
-[breathing heavily]

-Hey, breathe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<line>
I'll get the car seat. Let's go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<line>
Ugh. I ate too much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<line>
I need ice cream

to smoosh the rest of it down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<line>
Oh, I don't keep junk food in the house,

ever since last night

when I ate all of my ice cream.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<line>
Hey, why do you have a vodka bottle

for every day of the week?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
Oh, that's just my new system I'm trying.

I'm down to one bottle a day.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<line>
-Is this like an AA thing?

-No, I don't need AA.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<line>
-Would you get outta there?

-I want ice cream.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
-Give me your keys.

-What? No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<line>
-Come on. Let me drive the Tesla.

-With your greasy pizza fingers?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<line>
-Forget it.

-Come on! [giggling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<line>
-Hey.

-Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<line>
What the hell are these?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<line>
What? Oh, those...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<line>
Why was this in your pocket?

Are these for me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<line>
No, Hollyhock. God, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<line>
Oh God, did you put this in my pizza?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
What? Of course not. Hollyhock.

No. Give me the-- no!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<line>
-Oops.

-Hollyhock, those were for my back!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<line>
-Wait, for real?

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
Oh, then actually, oops.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
[lock clicks]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
-Hey, Todd. Is everything okay?

-I need to talk to someone,

and you're the only person I knew

would be available on a Friday night,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
-with nothing to do.

-Hey, I almost went to the movies tonight!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<line>
It's not my fault there's never anything

in the 8:00 hour.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
9:15 is too late. 7:00 is too early.

When am I supposed to eat dinner?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<line>
Uh, sneak in a bag of mashed potatoes

like the rest of us?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<line>
-Is this your whole apartment?

-It's a studio.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<line>
I ate lunch with a studio head

just yesterday.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

-This is <i>not </i>a studio.

-What do you need, Todd?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<line>
Well, my friend, Emily,

did something really nice for me,

and I wanna pay her back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<line>
-Thought you could help me brainstorm.

-Okay. What kind of things does she like?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
Well, sex, for one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<line>
Good for her!

A woman needs to know her own body

before she expects someone else

to know her body.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<line>
-What? What are we talking about?

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<line>
I think sex, for one?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
Oh! Diane, you sad-homed genius.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<line>
-You've cracked it!

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<line>
To the junkyard

behind the engineering school!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
-Always happy to contribute!

-[crashes]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<line>
[rattling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<line>
-Oh, my God, I'm sorry. I freaked out.

-It's not your fault.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
Your generation's been brainwashed

by McGruff the Crime Dog.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<line>
Who, by the way, I met at a party once?

Didn't ask me a single question about me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<line>
Yeah, and also

because of the time I overdosed on pills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<line>
Right, well, these were good pills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>
I told you I'm on a system now.

I'm not "doing drugs." This was medicine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<line>
Can you get more?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<line>
Oh, sure.

I'll just call the pharmacy and say,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<line>
"Hey, girl, you know

that highly-addictive opioid

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<line>
I'm supposed to take every three hours?

Well, I kind of misplaced them,

so could I just get some more?

I'm totally not a drug addict."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
-I'm really sorry.

-No. It's fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<line>
Let's enjoy our time together,

even though I'm in tremendous pain.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<line>
I'll try to forget it,

but the whole time

we might be thinking about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<line>
I do not blame you, but if you

blame yourself, that is okay with me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<line>
You must know a place

you can get more painkillers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<line>
I do know a guy,

but he's somewhat "south of Pico,"

if you know what I mean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
I don't. Why do Los Angeles people think

everyone else understands

your local references?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<line>
Okay, okay, let's go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<line>
I can't believe you're adopting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
I just realized

it was the right thing for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<line>
I just remember you were so adamant

about having the baby yourself,

even when I said we should talk

about other options.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<line>
-Yeah, but the way you said it--

-I'm not mad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
I just think it's funny you had

that change of heart <i>after </i>we broke up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<line>
[sighs] I'm sorry. This is not about me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<line>
You'll be a great mom,

and I'm really happy for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
-Yeah?

-Of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
Well, one day,

you're gonna be a great dad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<line>
-Hopefully as cool as Birthday Dad!

[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
-Why are we at the pediatrician?

-Trust me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>
This doctor is the sleaziest, dopiest,

scurviest of the scurvy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<line>
-Who is he?

-Exactly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<line>
-[Hollyhock yelps]

-Hu... wants to par-tay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<line>
Dr. Hu! Thank you for squeezing us in!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<line>
You always gotta make time

for your friends.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<line>
And I haven't seen you

since Sarah Lynn's funeral.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
Oh, right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<line>
That was a huge wake-up call for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
Next morning I looked in the mirror,

and you know who I saw staring back at me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<line>
-[Hollyhock] Who?

-Exactly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<line>
-What?

-No. Hu.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<line>
I spent 30 days at Pastiches Malibu

and now I'm sober.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<line>
It's like I completely regenerated

as a brand-new doctor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<line>
Congratulations.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
You'd have to be a real lost cause

not to seek help

after losing Sarah Lynn like that,

don't you think?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
Oh, deffo. I mean, you know, get help

or, you know,

work out a system on your own.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
Even, you know, whatever's right for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<line>
Anyway, I'm trying to get my hands

on some Feelbetterin?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
Feelbetterin?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<line>
BoJack, have you been taking

oxypraxylcortizoid?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<line>
Yeah. I know what you're thinking,

but I legitimately have a herniated disc.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
He's telling the truth!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
I threw out his pills because of my trauma

from when I got drugged by his mama.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<line>
-You got drugged by your own mother?

-No, my mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<line>
Her mother was a maid

who got knocked up by my dad,

but she got adopted by eight other dads.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<line>
Okay, do you know how many times

I hear this story every week?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<line>
This story, specifically?

Even the "eight dads" part?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<line>
I don't know who you think you're fooling,

but this Hu won't get fooled again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<line>
Thank you for coming, Emily.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<line>
What's with all the candles?

Why are you wearing a robe?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<line>
Oh, I blew a fuse earlier,

so I had to light candles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<line>
That took a while,

and then I didn't get to change.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<line>
-Oh.

-Hold that thought.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<line>
-The thought of "Oh"?

-That's right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
Because you're gonna need it

when you meet your new best friend...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
-Uh...

-[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<line>
-Whoa!

-Henry Fondle!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
[robot screaching]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<line>
-What? What?

-He's a sex robot!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<line>
So, you can stop dating

all those boring guys and still have sex!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<line>
-Stop me if you've heard this one. What?

-And guess what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<line>
I even recorded dozens

of sexy robot phrases

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
-for it to say at random intervals!

-[clicks]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
[robot] <i>I am Henry Fondle.</i>

<i>Insert me into genitals!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<line>
-Why did you do this?

-To show you that I care about your needs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<line>
[robot] <i>My prime directive</i>

<i>is to pleasure you.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />

<line>
Todd, I'm not sure you understand

how sex works.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
That is so condescending.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<line>
I know what sex is. I am not a child.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<line>
I'm just not great at building robots.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<line>
This is my first one, and frankly,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<line>
I think it's pretty impressive

I put it together in one afternoon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<line>
<i>I love it when you call me "Father."</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<line>
-[clatters]

-[both gasp]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<line>
Oh, no!

My wacky scheme backfired as always!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<line>
-I'm really sorry.

-It's fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<line>
We're spending time together,

that's all that matters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:07" />

<line>
You're not super-mad at me, still?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<line>
When this is done,

maybe it'll make a great story

you can tell that kid you have a crush on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<line>
Who, Joby? [chuckles]

I don't have a crush on him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<line>
Get out of here.

His jawline is, like, dumb.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<line>
-Oh, okay.

-Where are we going now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<line>
There's this actress I was kind of seeing

while we were working together

and I might have left some pills

at her place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<line>
She made it clear she doesn't want

to see me again but she's not home now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<line>
-Why do I know Gina's schedule?

-Where is she?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:32" />

<line>
She has a book club with dumb Nicole

who keeps picking very long Italian books

that Nicole doesn't even read.

Why do I know about Gina's friends?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
-Do you have a key?

-I have my ways.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<line>
-Well, I'm out of ways.

-I'll go around back

and see if there's a window

I can climb through.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
Ooh, good thinking! I'll stand guard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<line>
[winces] Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<line>
Oh, shit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:55" />

<line>
Oh, my God! What happened to book club?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<line>
We switched it to Thursdays

to confuse Nicole.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<line>
-Why are you here?

-I just wanted to check on you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<line>
[Gina sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<line>
-[gasps]

-Wait, Gina. No, stay outside.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<line>
I just-- I need to talk to you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
Slowly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<line>
Is this about our relationship?

What is there to talk about?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<line>
Well, I just been thinking that...

we should<i> keep looking</i>

at this relationship.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<line>
Like<i> all</i> parts of this relationship.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<line>
Like even in the <i>junk drawer,</i>

<i>in the kitchen </i>of this relationship.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<line>
-Or <i>the bathroom cabinet.</i>

-I told you I didn't want to see you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<line>
I want you to know

that you are top-shelf, Gina.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<line>
-Know what I mean? <i>Top shelf.</i>

-So, what, you wanna get back together?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<line>
-Eh...?

-Yes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<line>
Wait, really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<line>
-Okay, I gotta run.

-BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<line>
I have had 28 on-set flings,

and no guy has ever come to my house

after shooting was over to try

to have a real relationship.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:47" />

<line>
-Well...

-I guess I sort of internalized the idea

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
I didn't deserve that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
Yeah, but like I said, I really gotta run.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<line>
But maybe I do deserve it.

Maybe we both do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<line>
BoJack, is it possible that we're the ones

we've been waiting for?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<line>
Uh, yes. I totally think that is possible,

which is why I can't wait

to talk about this tomorrow!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<line>
-What? Where are you going?

-I'll call you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<line>
[Hollyhock panting] Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<line>
Think I need to call her,

or did I leave things open enough

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<line>
-where I can kinda ghost?

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<line>
Kidding! I'll call her.

I'm very fond of that woman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<line>
And I'm sure

that things are gonna work out fine,

and we can find a way to be happy together

and I won't hurt her

in a way that she carries with her

for the rest of her life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<line>
-Uh, okay.

-Lemme get them pills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<line>
-What the hell? These aren't my pills!

-Sorry!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<line>
-Not your fault. It's just... my back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<line>
-I got another idea.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<line>
-Do you think Gina needed those?

-She'll be fine. Nobody<i> needs</i> pills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<line>
-You could've just dropped me off.

-I wanted to be here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<line>
-Hope that's okay.

-It's actually nice you're here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<line>
All the times I imagined us

taking home a baby from the hospital,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<line>
I never pictured it like this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<line>
You mean, you never pictured

it would happen on a Friday?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<line>
[laughs] Yeah, exactly.

That's the main difference.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<line>
[sighs] How come you never called me

after I kicked you out of my apartment?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<line>
You were so mad at me.

I didn't think you wanted me to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<line>
I didn't.

But you still should have called.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<line>
-Well, you could have called me.

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<line>
-I wish you'd stayed with me that night.

-You told me to leave.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:11" />

<line>
Yeah. I guess the lesson is,

don't listen to me, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<line>
[Ralph chuckles] Mm-hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:16" />

<line>
Is that really what you're gonna wear

for the first time your new baby sees you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<line>
-Yes?

-Oof! Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<line>
I'm supposed to be back

at the airport in, like, two hours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<line>
Is this really

how you want to spend this time?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<line>
Again, and... [chuckles]

I hate to keep harping on this,

we wouldn't be here

if someone hadn't dumped my medicine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<line>
I know, but this place is super sketchy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<line>
It looks like

where they did the drag race in<i> Grease.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<line>
It <i>is </i>where they did the drag race

in<i> Grease.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<line>
-Where do you think they make movies?

-Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<line>
-[Hollyhock yelps]

-[tires screech]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<line>
-You a cop?

-What? No. Oh, shit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<line>
No, it's a costume.

I just finished filming a show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<line>
Normally, people return the costume.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<line>
Hello, drug merchant.

Is it<i> lit</i> under here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
What?

</line>

Are there illegal pharmaceuticals

available for purchase?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<line>
And please, talk into my lollipop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<line>
-Okay, this guy's a cop.

-I assure you I am not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<line>
He's just saying that

because earlier I said he was a cop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<line>
No. You can see the outline of his badge

under his tee-shirt!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<line>
-Yeah, no, he's definitely a cop.

-Seems cool to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<line>
Listen. If I were a cop,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<line>
I'd have pancake breath

from the precinct's

weekly Friday night pancake dinners.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<line>
-But I do not. So clearly, not a cop.

-Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<line>
Unless, I somehow had an Altoid,

or a Tic-Tac after,

which again, no.

[chuckles] I am a gum guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<line>
That all tracks for me.

Here are your drugs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<line>
-Aha! We got the package!

-Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<line>
-[tires screech, siren wails]

-[BoJack] Run!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<line>
-[Hollyhock gasps]

-They're getting away!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<line>
-Go, go, go!

-[siren wails]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<line>
-[BoJack panting]

-[Hollyhock moans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
-[Hollyhock] Oh, no!

-Here, get up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<line>
[both grunting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<line>
[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<line>
-Eh...?

-Come on! We have to keep moving!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<line>
-[hissing]

-[Emily] Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<line>
-Thanks, Doug.

-I'm not here for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<line>
I'm here because I respect the art

of putting out fires. [puffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<line>
- I'm really sorry, Emily.

-It was a sweet idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<line>
I guess I just thought

you waste so much time

with these boring firemen

just for the sex.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<line>
-Eh?

-Doug, some privacy, please?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<line>
Maybe I figured if you had some other way

to satisfy yourself sexually,

then you could spend more time with me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<line>
-Like we did in high school.

-Todd, we were dating in high school.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<line>
Do you ever think about

what it would be like if we dated now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<line>
I don't know. What would it be like?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<line>
I guess we'd hang out together,

like we already do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<line>
And you would be my favorite person,

like you already are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
And when something good happened to me,

like if I got a promotion at work,

you'd be the first person I'd tell,

and you'd smile and say,

"That's my boyfriend."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<line>
Well, that could be cool.

But then I would have sex with the robot?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<line>
[whirring] <i>Boop, boop, boop! Oh!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
-[splatters]

-[sighs] Uh-hh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
<i>-Hooray.</i>

-I guess it's not ideal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<line>
You know,

when I was putting the app together,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<line>
I learned that some asexuals

actually <i>do </i>have sex.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<line>
-Do you... think that there's a chance?

-[mutters] Um-umm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<line>
-Okay. Well, you got any other ideas?

-Hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<line>
What about if marbles were cube-shaped,

so they don't roll away as much?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<line>
-No dice.

-[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
[Princess Carolyn] Oh, he's beautiful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
Do you think I'm terrible

for giving him away?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
What? Of course not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<line>
I don't know the first thing

about being a parent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<line>
-Bridget, it's okay.

-Your baby's in excellent hands.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<line>
I'm just so glad he's going

to a good home,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<line>
-with a mother and a father.

-What's this, now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<line>
I mean, if my boyfriend was still

in the picture, maybe I could be a parent,

but as is, I think the baby's

probably better off with you two.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
-Oh, no, Ralph's not--

-That's right!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
We're gonna make

a wonderful family together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<line>
-Ralph, don't lie to her.

-I'm not lying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<line>
A year ago, we wanted to have

a family together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<line>
-I still want that.

-Ralph, no. You should go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
I hear you say that, but I'm not making

the mistake I made last time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<line>
I don't want this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<line>
This seems like a subject

you should have agreed on

before you came to the hospital.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<line>
We can do this. Nothing has changed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<line>
I changed! I have plans now,

and you're not in them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<line>
-You don't need to do this by yourself.

-I never needed to. I <i>want </i>to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
I'm not afraid of how hard it's gonna be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
I already love this baby.

And that gives me so much power.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<line>
I don't need anything else.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
Oh, my God, I just realized something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<line>
If you can do it by yourself,

maybe that means I can do it by myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<line>
-Uh...

-No, no, Bridget, you definitely can't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<line>
I thought I couldn't.

But that speech you gave was so inspiring.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<line>
It made me realize that all I need

to be a good mother is love.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<line>
Actually, you need <i>so </i>much more than that.

I was wrong when I said that a second ago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<line>
[chuckles] Okay. But for real,

give me my baby boy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<line>
-[moans] Oh-hh...

-Coochie-coochie-choo...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<line>
-[moans]

-Princess Carolyn, you are amazing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
-Can you be <i>my </i>mom?

-[groans] Oh-hh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<line>
[both panting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<line>
[coughing]

There's gotta be another way to get pills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<line>
How about calling this Joby?

He sounds like a druggie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<line>
-I thought your back hurts.

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
-How did you lift me over the fence?

-Well, the adrenaline kicked in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<line>
-Do you <i>really </i>need these pills?

-Hollyhock, how many times--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<line>
I'm just saying,

is it possible maybe you don't--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<line>
Okay. You go to college

and suddenly you're so sophisticated,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<line>
-and I'm a dumb junkie, is that it?

-What? No!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<line>
You don't understand anything!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<line>
-I am in pain.

-No, I get that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
All the time. my whole life.

And you have no idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<line>
So, sorry that you had one bad experience

with my mom,

but I have been in pain my whole life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
I think you should take me to the airport.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<line>
-You're sure I can't drive you home?

-No, Ralph.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<line>
Can I at least wait with you for the cab?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<line>
[sighs] Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<line>
[buckle clicks]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
So, I guess I'll see you later.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<line>
-Hollyhock, I'm sorry.

-Me, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<line>
Maybe, it's possible that I don't...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<line>
100-percent need-need the pills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<line>
I thought I did, but-- yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<line>
So, thank you for... caring about me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
-Are you gonna be okay?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<line>
I could take a semester off,

if you need someone--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<line>
No. God, no. Stay... stay in school.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<line>
And take your classes, and kiss boys,

and do the college thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
I'm gonna be fine.

I get it. Drugs are bad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<line>
Not all drugs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<line>
Obviously, if you get hurt again,

and a doctor, a real doctor

prescribes you painkillers,

you can take them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<line>
-But only if you get hurt again.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<line>
-You promise?

-Yes. I promise.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<line>
Okay. I love you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<line>
[sighs] Hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<line>
Okay. Bye.
