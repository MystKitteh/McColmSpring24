Look, nothing's easy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:36" />

<line>
But I wouldn't be talking to you now

if I didn't believe

that it wasn't too late for us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:40" />

<line>
So what are we doing here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<line>
I don't know about the rest of you,

but I'm here to put on the best

goddamn production of <i>Hedda Gabler</i>

this supermax prison has ever seen!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<line>
{\an8}So let's take it back

to Mrs. Elvsted's entrance,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<line>
{\an8}and remember, if you're on stage,

I can see you, you're in character,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:59" />

<line>
{\an8}you have an opinion

about the return of Ejlert Løvborg.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<line>
-[guard clears throat]

-Oh, shit, is it 10:30 already?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:04" />

<line>
Okay, look, guys, I gotta go,

but I'll be back tomorrow

and we'll pick up rehearsals Monday.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:08" />

<line>
If everyone could be off-book by then,

that would be phenomenal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<line>
{\an8}Schlesinger,

if you have time to fashion a shiv

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<line>
{\an8}and organize a jump on the rats

in Block C,

you have time to learn your lines, 'kay?

<line>
-Priorities.

{\an8}-There he is!

-[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<line>
Uh-oh! America's most wanted

over here, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<line>
-Thanks for picking me up.

-The jury finds you guilty

of being a super-cool dude, am I right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
You're extremely clever, can we go?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<line>
{\an8}I sentence you to life...

filled with my friendship!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<line>
{\an8}If this is my only other option,

I choose prison.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<line>
{\an8}So you were just planning

on wearing this to the wedding?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
{\an8}Really leaning on that "optional"

in black tie optional.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<line>
These are the clothes I went in with.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<line>
I didn't know

I'd be going to a wedding in a year.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
{\an8}That's why you always gotta pack

a spare suit, just in case.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
{\an8}-What are you in for again?

-Officially, breaking and entering,

but I think it was kind of for everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<line>
Ah, a little bit of everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<line>
Like the varied cuisine

at your favorite small plate

lazy Susan restaurant, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
-Pardon?

-Do you have a favorite

establishment of that sort?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<line>
A favorite small plate

lazy Susan restaurant? Hell if I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<line>
BoJack, it means so much

that you would say that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
I actually am a little hungry.

Where could we get lunch around here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
Elefino!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<line>
No? Oh, how about the diner?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
So, do you spend a lot of time

with them, as a couple?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<line>
Well, I see Princess Carolyn a lot

at "Birthday Dad" events.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
Emmys, Golden Globes,

Critic's Choice Awards, Peabody Awards.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
The Nobel Prize for Television

they created just for our show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
But Judah usually stays home with Ruthie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<line>
-I can't believe she's getting married.

-Thought it would be with you, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<line>
I thought it would be with nobody

because I wasted all her best years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
Turns out her best years are now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<line>
Well, joke's on me.

I couldn't even waste the right years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
I'm shocked she could get me out

for the weekend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<line>
-When are you getting out for real?

-Few months.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<line>
Wow. What are you gonna do next?

Big plans post-big house?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<line>
<i>Big Momma's House</i> reboot?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<line>
Reboot of the franchise

<i>Big Momma's House, </i>starring you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
My main goal right now

is just not screwing up this weekend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<line>
You won't screw it up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
I'm sure I'll find a way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<line>
-Mm. [grunts]

-[exclaims]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<line>
[BoJack groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<line>
Can you get me another suit?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
You think Diane's gonna be there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<line>
Everyone's going to be there.

It's the party of the year.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<line>
I haven't talked to Diane since, uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
-What about you? Are you seeing anyone?

-Oh, I'm too busy with my show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<line>
Those birthdays

aren't gonna dad themselves!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
What is this show?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<line>
Besides, I'm really trying to focus

on myself right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<line>
I had this breakthrough recently.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<line>
One day, in therapy, I just blurted out,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
"Is my problem with women

any movie directed by Christopher Nolan?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<line>
Because, yes, women are involved,

but it's really never about the women.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<line>
It's about me."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<line>
-That's actually somewhat astute.

-It occurred to me:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<line>
Are my self-destructive patterns

and unexamined cycles of co-dependency

the popular Jim Carrey character The Mask?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
Because "somebody stop me"!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
Are all of your breakthroughs

phrased like that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
Um, are all of my breakthroughs a British

prog-rock band from the '70s?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
-Because yes.

-Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<line>
W-What are we doing here?

Is this where the wedding is?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<line>
-I just have to make a real quick stop.

-At the Griffith Observatory?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<line>
-I have a press event.

-You took me to a press event?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<line>
It was on the way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<line>
Ah! No. What do you... I can't be here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<line>
-It'll take 15 minutes, 20 tops.

-[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<line>
Definitely not more

than two and a half hours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<line>
[Mr. Peanutbutter] Hello, everybody!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<line>
{\an8}You all know and love me

as the titular Birthday Dad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<line>
I've also been known for other roles:

Sad Dog, fracking advocate,

finder-outer of what

Hollywoo stars and celebrities know

and whether they know things,

but some of you might remember me

as the notorious Stealer of the "D"!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<line>
[all] Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<line>
Now, to celebrate the success

of "Birthday Dad,"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
I thought it was time

I gave a birthday present back!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<line>
I called up my favorite sign company

and said,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<line>
"I wanna give this whole town the 'D'!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<line>
'D' for Dad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
'Birthday Dad,' that is!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
[all] Yay!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
So, without further a-dad,

let's say goodbye

to the era of Hollywoo forever,

and say hello to...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<line>
-Holly... woob?

-[all gasping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<line>
Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
No, I said "D" as in "Birthday Dad."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<line>
No, obviously I meant the "Dad" part

of "Birthday Dad,"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
I assumed that went without saying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<line>
Look, I gotta go,

but the next time I need a sign made

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
I'm going to strongly consider

going with a different company.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<line>
Okay, next stop: wedding!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<line>
I'm not ready for this.

You gotta take me back to jail.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<line>
What? Come on, Shawshank,

you're gonna be fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<line>
No, I can't be around people.

I can't face them, I'm not ready.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
-What do you think is gonna happen?

-I don't know! I never know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<line>
I just know that something bad

is gonna happen

if I go to that wedding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:49" />

<line>
How about this? We'll go to the wedding

and if you get there

and you wanna leave, we can leave.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
-Yeah?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<line>
And if you wanna stay,

I'll stay there with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
I will not leave your side.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<line>
-You sure?

-Of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<line>
I'm here for you, buddy. No matter what.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<line>
Unless I see my good friend Erica

and get distracted

by some noteworthy aspect

of her character or presentation,

but, BoJack,

what are the odds that would...

-BoJack! Thank God I found you!

-[grunts] What? What is it?

<line>
The fireworks are going to start

in ten minutes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
There's no time to explain.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:29" />

<line>
We need to go down to the beach

so I can sit on your shoulders!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<line>
-What? Why?

-I just said there's no time to explain!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<line>
Did you go to jail

for being a bad listener?

</line>

<line>
Oh, wow! That's like a 3-D one!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<line>
[BoJack] So...

why did we need to be on the beach?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<line>
Oh, you just seemed

really overwhelmed at the party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<line>
-I thought you could use some air.

-Oh. Thanks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<line>
But then why are you on my shoulders?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<line>
So I could get

a better view of the fireworks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<line>
-Okay, get down. Oh, okay.

-[grunting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<line>
It's good to see you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
How'd you get out of the supermax?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
Did a helicopter crash

into the side of the building

and then you just walked out?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<line>
What? No. I'm just here for the wedding.

I'm going back tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<line>
Oh, bummer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<line>
No, it's good.

I think the routine is good for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<line>
-I'm staying out of trouble, at least.

-Hooray! Staying out of trouble, at least!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<line>
I'm trying to set little goals for myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<line>
Like, in a couple months,

I'll beat my record for being sober.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<line>
-Nice!

-Yeah, so that's...

that's something to aim for,

but then, uh, after that, um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<line>
After that, you'll beat your record again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<line>
Every day, you'll set a new record.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
Sure. But it's easy now. In jail.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<line>
I don't have to

make any choices for myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<line>
I worry about what's gonna happen

when I get out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<line>
-What if I relapse again?

-Then you'll get sober again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<line>
-[groans]

-Let me tell you something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<line>
I was at the office the other day,

doing the "Hokey Pokey"

with some work associates...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<line>
-Uh-huh.

-...and I realized

everyone misunderstands that song.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<line>
"The Hokey Pokey"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<line>
Yeah, there's way too much emphasis

on the "hokey pokey" part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<line>
That is what it's all about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
No. That's exactly what I mean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<line>
-That's not what the song is saying.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:11" />

<line>
And I was thinking about my mom,

you know, my relationship with my mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<line>
It's weird. You know, awkward.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<line>
I feel like she doesn't really get me,

but, you know, she's trying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<line>
And a couple years ago,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<line>
I never thought I would have

any kind of relationship with her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<line>
Like, I was sure of it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<line>
What changed?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
I don't know. I did? Or-- Or she did?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<line>
Or, um, we... are?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
-Huh.

-So, that's what I'm talking about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<line>
It's like the song says.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
"You do the hokey pokey

and you turn yourself around."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
You turn yourself around.

That's what it's all about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
Yeah, I don't know if the songwriters

put that much thought

into the existential significance

of the lyrics.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<line>
They literally rhyme "about" with "about."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<line>
But isn't the point of art

less what people put into it

and more what people get out of it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<line>
-Is that the point of art?

-Maybe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<line>
Or maybe art doesn't need a point.

Maybe that's why it's called art.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
I can't tell

if you're being smart or stupid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<line>
Oh, I never know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<line>
I think you had it for a moment

and then you lost it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<line>
[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<line>
Oh, well!

It was nice while it lasted, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<line>
Sure. It was nice while it lasted.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
[fireworks popping, whistling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<line>
[upbeat music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<line>
Huh! Not bad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<line>
Hey, there he is!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<line>
Oh, my God,

that was an incredible wedding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<line>
Yeah? It wasn't too much

with the fireworks,

and the cirque performers,

and the procession of exotic peafowl?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
No, you produced the hell out of it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<line>
What'd you think about the part

where the priest got murdered

and Judah had to figure out

which bridesmaid was the culprit?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<line>
A little outside the box,

as far as weddings go,

but it worked in context.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<line>
I thought so, too!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<line>
Congratulations.

And Judah, too. Where is he?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<line>
I think he's going over some contracts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<line>
We're putting together

an all-female reboot

of <i>12 Angry Men.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<line>
It's called "11 Angry Women."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<line>
-Not 12?

-You gotta leave room for a sequel.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
So your groom is doing paperwork

during his own wedding reception?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
Oh, we had our real wedding a week ago.

This one's just for the industry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<line>
-What?

-I invited the town's top talent,

took away their phones,

and shuffled them together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
Give 'em some booze, get 'em chatty,

next day, they're calling me,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
"Hey, could you put me in touch

with so-and-so?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<line>
-Boom! I've attached myself as a producer!

-Does that really work?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>
Hey, Jennifer Jason Leigh!

Have you met regular Jason Lee?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<line>
You're my two favorite Jason Lees.

Discuss.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
Well, I am offended I wasn't

important enough for your real wedding,

but I'm flattered I'm important enough

for your industry one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<line>
Are you kidding?

"Horny Unicorn" is tracking huge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
-What?

-All of Hollywoob

is buzzing about your comeback.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<line>
No. Did you say "Hollywoob"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<line>
If this movie does what it's supposed to,

the district attorney's not the only one

who's gonna wanna lock you into something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<line>
I'm not sure

I should take on more projects.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<line>
I started this drama program at prison

and we're doing <i>Hedda Gabler.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<line>
I mean, it's not Strindberg,

but, you know, we're having a good time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<line>
I thought that maybe when I got out,

I could go back and volunteer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
Oh! Well, that sounds fabulous!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<line>
Yeah, but... [stammers] I didn't even

think that I'd have other options.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<line>
A year ago,

everyone in this town hated me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<line>
People have short memories.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<line>
It's the best and worst thing

about people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<line>
Well, maybe there's a way I could do both?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<line>
-I've really enjoyed teaching.

-Oh! Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
Maybe I could direct something?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<line>
-I'm sorry I said anything. I--

-Well, I mean, hold on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<line>
Yeah, I shouldn't

just jump into something,

but if there's a good opportunity,

I'd be stupid not to take it, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:36" />

<line>
I mean, we both know how hard it is

to get heat in this town.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
Think it over.

I'm sure you'll make the right decision.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<line>
Well, a decision.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<line>
[soft music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<line>
-Hey, you wanna dance?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<line>
-What?

-Oh! Aw.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<line>
[both chuckle]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<line>
You know, I had this weird idea

when I heard you were getting married

that I'd get here

and there'd be some disaster,

and I knew that either I would cause it

or, just maybe,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<line>
I would be the only one who could fix it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<line>
A disaster, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<line>
Not like a "disaster" disaster,

like a sitcom disaster, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<line>
Like, it would be time for the wedding

and no one would know where to find you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<line>
-No one but you, right?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<line>
And I'd find you in some special spot

and I'd say, "Come on, it's time to go."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<line>
And you'd say,

"What am I doing, BoJack?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<line>
[chuckles] And then what,

I'd run off with you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<line>
No, I would talk you

into going through with it,

and it would be like a symbol

of how much I'd grown,

that I could let you go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<line>
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
No, I mean, I'm happy for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<line>
Just... it's a better story

if you had cold feet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:43" />

<line>
It's a better story for you.

I think I like it better this way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<line>
I guess you're right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<line>
What would you have said to me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<line>
Oh, I don't know. I would have said, uh,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
-"Come on, man. Do it."

-[chuckles] Oh, wow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<line>
No, no, no. I would-- Okay. Hold on.

Tell me what you're afraid of.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<line>
In this make-believe scenario

that you came up with?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
-Yeah.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<line>
Well, I guess I'm afraid

of losing some part of myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
I'm afraid that if I let someone else

take care of me

that I'm not really me anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<line>
I'm afraid of getting too comfortable,

you know, going soft.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<line>
I'm afraid that this could be

the best thing that ever happened to me

and if it doesn't make me

as happy as I'm supposed to be,

that means I'm a lost cause.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<line>
-Holy shit.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

<line>
I don't know,

those are some really good arguments.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<line>
-Are you kidding me?!

-Okay, okay, look.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<line>
Yes, all those things could be true,

but on the other hand,

what if you deserve to be happy

and this is a thing

that will make you happy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<line>
And maybe don't worry

about whether you'll be happy later

and just focus

on how you're happy right now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
-Oh, is it that easy?

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<line>
But you're here because, at some point,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn thought

this was a good idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<line>
And I think we oughta listen to her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:59" />

<line>
Because she's the smartest woman I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<line>
That's true. She is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<line>
So, what do you think?

Are you gonna marry him?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<line>
Well, I already got the dress.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<line>
But you didn't need me

to say any of that, did you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<line>
I guess I didn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<line>
Hey, if I do decide

to get back into the business

when I get out of prison...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<line>
I mean, I probably won't, but if I do,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<line>
I'm gonna need representation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<line>
Someone who can look out for me,

help me make the right decisions,

keep me out of trouble...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<line>
I can recommend some excellent people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<line>
[muffled music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<line>
[inhales, exhales]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<line>
Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<line>
-Thought I might find you here.

-I'm trying to quit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<line>
Yeah, you look like

you're trying really hard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<line>
Don't be shitty.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<line>
I haven't seen you in a while.

You doing okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<line>
Yeah, I'm doing okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<line>
-I mean, you know, okay.

-Sure.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<line>
I'm working

on this middle-grade fiction series.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<line>
[chuckles] I mean, who am I, Rick Riordan?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<line>
Who's Rick Riordan?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:11" />

<line>
Yeah, good point.

What have you been up to?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<line>
Well, let's see, um,

I've been getting into podcasts,

went through a Sudoku phase, and, uh,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<line>
-oh, I'm in prison, so...

-Right. That's still happening?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<line>
Oh, it's very much happening.

I've also got a new movie coming out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<line>
Oh, yeah, with Vance Waggoner, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<line>
I know what you're thinking, but he's--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
You don't need to explain yourself to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<line>
I know you think

I'm some kind of a sell-out,

but it wasn't like other opportunities

were banging down my door...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<line>
-I'm not arguing with you.

-Because of "Horny Unicorn"--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<line>
I'm not going to help you work through

whatever you're trying to work through.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<line>
I just came out here to smoke.

You came to me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<line>
-Because I wanted to talk to you.

-About what? "The Horny Unicorn"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<line>
No, about-- I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<line>
I just wanted to talk to you.

[stammers] I miss talking to you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:52" />

<line>
[cigarette sizzles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<line>
I wish I had my phone right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<line>
Yeah, I know what you mean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<line>
I never know what to do

with my hands at parties.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
No, I wish I had my phone

so I could play you

the last voicemail you left me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<line>
Did you remember that,

that you left me a voicemail?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<line>
[inhales] Ooh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<line>
I thought you were sober.

You told me you were sober.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<line>
And things were good in my life

and I was thinking about my future,

and then I woke up one morning

and I had this voicemail.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
Look, I-I wasn't in the--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<line>
You were happy on the voicemail.

You sounded happy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<line>
Or lightly sardonic, or glibly nihilistic,

or however you'd describe

that thing you get

that's the closest to the emotion

normal people call happy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<line>
-I'm sorry--

-And you were clearly intoxicated,

and you were talking about swimming.

"I'm going swimming," you said.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<line>
"Since nothing matters anyway,

and nobody cares about me,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<line>
-I might as well go swimming, right?"

-I'm so sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
"Call me back

if you don't want me to go swimming.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<line>
Otherwise, I'm just gonna assume

you don't care."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<line>
I thought you were dead.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<line>
For seven hours,

I couldn't get in touch with anyone

and I was sure you were dead,

and it was my fault for leaving you,

for feeling good, for not worrying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
When I left for Chicago,

you promised me you were gonna be okay,

but I made you promise me that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
-Was I selfish for believing you?

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<line>
Why did you call me?

You knew I was in Chicago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<line>
I don't know. I was drunk

and-- and I was high.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<line>
And I just... I wanted to talk to you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
When I found out you weren't dead,

I was angry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<line>
I was relieved, but I was also angry

that I'd given you that power over me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<line>
I was angry at you for a really long time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<line>
Are you still angry at me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<line>
No. I don't know.

What good has being angry at you

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
-ever done for me?

-I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<line>
I wish I could have been

the person you thought I was,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
-the person who would save you.

-That was never your job.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<line>
Then why did you always make me

feel like it was?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<line>
I don't know, maybe it's everybody's job

to save each other.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<line>
I don't know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:50" />

<line>
Anyway, I'm glad you're alive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
I am, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<line>
So, you're still in Chicago, then, or...?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<line>
When I got that voicemail,

my boyfriend at the time

wanted me to move to Houston with him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<line>
I wanted to move with him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<line>
But after you called, I got scared.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<line>
-Oh, no.

-I didn't trust myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<line>
I was happy and I didn't trust that.

So I stayed in Chicago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<line>
We tried to make it work long distance,

but it was hard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
Eventually, I just thought,

"This is stupid."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
So, what, you broke up with him?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<line>
No. I moved to Houston.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<line>
To be with your boyfriend at the time?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<line>
Yeah. Plus, the winters in Chicago

are cold as shit,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<line>
I don't know why anyone

would build a city there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<line>
No wonder that cow started that fire.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<line>
I get it. I'm on Team Cow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<line>
But your boyfriend at the time,

he's not your boyfriend anymore?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<line>
He is not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<line>
-Wow.

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<line>
How'd you learn how to trust it?

The happiness?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<line>
I didn't. But I trust him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
It's hard to imagine you in Houston.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
Oh, I'm like

a totally different person now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<line>
-Are you?

-No?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<line>
Yes? I wear fewer jackets.

I smile more.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<line>
Sometimes I look back at my LA years,

and I think, "Who was that person?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
Does she ever come back, that Diane?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
Sometimes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
I felt her when I got back to LA.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<line>
I feel her now that I'm talking to you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
But it's not you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<line>
I mean, it's all me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<line>
I'd love to say,

"No, she's gone forever."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<line>
But I was terrified

of coming back here for the wedding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<line>
-Seeing Mr. Peanutbutter. Seeing you.

-What'd you think was gonna happen?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<line>
I don't know, I would spin out,

start questioning everything,

blow everything up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<line>
But that didn't happen, did it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<line>
No. That didn't happen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<line>
But was part of you

kinda hoping that it would?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<line>
Mm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<line>
You ever miss the mess?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<line>
No, "miss" is the wrong word.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<line>
Sorry, Miss.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<line>
I'm glad I lived in LA,

but I'm not nostalgic for it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<line>
I'm glad I knew Mr. Peanutbutter,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<line>
-even though he's not in my life anymore.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<line>
I think there are people that help you

become the person that you end up being,

and you can be grateful for them

even if they were never

meant to be in your life forever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<line>
I'm glad I knew you, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
"Knew," huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
Mm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<line>
Hey, wouldn't it be funny

if this night was the last time

we ever talked to each other?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<line>
-Um, anyway, I--

-I need to tell you...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<line>
No. You don't have to--

You don't owe me anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<line>
No, I need to tell you: Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
And it's going to be okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<line>
And I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
And... [softly] thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<line>
-Wait.

-Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
I know. I know.

But can I just tell you a funny story?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<line>
Sure.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<line>
But it better be very funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<line>
I don't wanna lie to you,

it's only kind of funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<line>
So we have this movie night

at the prison, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
And we get to vote

on what movies we wanna see.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<line>
But of course the whole thing's rigged,

because Big Andy's favorite movie

is <i>The Family Stone,</i>

so Big Andy gets his guys

to vote for it every week,

and so every week

we watch <i>The Family Stone.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<line>
Hold on, whose favorite movie

is <i>The Family Stone?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
I mean, yeah, it's a fine movie...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<line>
-But every week?

-That's what I'm saying!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<line>
So, one day I'm like, "If I see

Luke Wilson teach Sarah Jessica Parker

how to let her freak flag fly

one more time, I'm gonna snap."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<line>
I don't understand,

is movie night mandatory?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />

<line>
-No.

-So why don't you just not go?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
What am I, a philistine?

I support the arts, sue me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<line>
Okay, sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<line>
But I know a guy

who volunteers in the library,

which is where they keep the DVDs,

so I make a deal with him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:44" />

<line>
"I'll give you my Jell-O for a month

if <i>The Family Stone</i> goes missing."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:48" />

<line>
I feel like this doesn't end well.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<line>
So, movie might comes around,

time for another Christmas in Connecticut,

but then, uh-oh, the DVD's gone,

what do we do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<line>
So Big Andy's getting really upset,

and his guys are all riled,

and then I go, "Fellas, fellas, fellas!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<line>
Why don't we watch

<i>Pieces of April </i>this week?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<line>
Change of pace.

Patricia Clarkson's in it and..."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<line>
And?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<line>
-Prison riot.

-Oh, shit, really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<line>
No. Worse. Big Andy falls in love

with <i>Pieces of April,</i>

so now we watch<i> Pieces of April</i>

every week.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<line>
[chuckles] You kind of made your own bed

on that one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<line>
Story of my life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:20" />

<line>
[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<line>
I'm sorry, that sounds awful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<line>
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?

Life's a bitch and then you die, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
Sometimes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:30" />

<line>
Sometimes life's a bitch

and then you keep living.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:33" />

<line>
Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:36" />

<line>
But it's a nice night, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:39" />

<line>
Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:41" />

<line>
This is nice.

</line>
