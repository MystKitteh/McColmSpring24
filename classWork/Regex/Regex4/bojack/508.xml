<line>
Halloween. Fright Night.

Spook-tober 30-cursed!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
Oh, there's the light switch.

I'm still getting used to this new house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<line>
I just bought it and it's the '60s!

No, I'm just kidding!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
It's 1993, and I'm wearing a costume!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<line>
Groovy threads!

But you just got drafted, hippie!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<line>
-Hmm?

-Into the cutest husband army!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<line>
-[laughs, moans]

-Aw!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:32" />

<line>
Where's your costume?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<line>
Can't I just wear a dumb hat

and say I'm Blossom?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<line>
In my opinionation... Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<line>
I am so excited to go

to a real Hollywood party

with my husband the TV star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<line>
Just do me a favor

and don't leave me alone, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<line>
-Okay!

-Now hurry up and finish getting ready.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<line>
I'm kidding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
Can you imagine

if I spoke to you like that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<line>
I really can't!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<line>
Next time, we're doing

a couples costume, though!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<line>
It's the perfect way to tell the world

that you are completely on the same...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<line>
-<i>paaaaage?</i>

-What are you wearing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<line>
I thought we were going

as Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling

in the this-year 2004 hit film

<i>The Notebook.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
<i>Ooοοοh!</i> You just said, <i>"The Notebook."</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
I thought you were gonna be, like,

a pen or something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<line>
The important thing is

we both look super-cute,

and everyone is gonna be, like,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<line>
"Hey, is that Jessica Biel

from the upcoming<i> Blade: Trinity?''</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<line>
And I'll say my famous<i> Blade: Trinity</i>

catchphrase, "Stop goofin' around, Blade!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<line>
Are you sure you're gonna be okay

at this party?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<line>
Whenever I went with Katrina,

we'd always end up in a big fight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<line>
Well, I'm not Katrina.

This is gonna be fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<line>
Okay. I just know you're afraid

of mummies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<line>
And since it's Halloween,

we might see some mummies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<line>
I'm not afraid of mummies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<line>
I just don't like them

because of an incident...

from my past.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:41" />

<line>
Will you stay on the lookout

and keep those creepy corpses away?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<line>
I'll be sure to make

a mental<i> note</i> of it!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:47" />

<line>
I'm a notebook.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

<line>
I'm not sure I get our costumes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<line>
You're the guy from<i> The Hangover.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:52" />

<line>
The first one, which just came out

this year. Why did I say "first one?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:55" />

<line>
There's only one<i> Hangover</i> movie,

and it's 2009.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:58" />

<line>
-And you are...?

-Your Baby Bjorn Borg.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:03" />

<line>
Famous '70s tennis player!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />

<line>
-And what's with the robot stuff?

-Borg. From<i> Star Trek?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:07" />

<line>
And you're also a baby?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:08" />

<line>
In<i> The Hangover,</i> the guy had a Baby Bjorn.

Baby Bjorn Borg.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:12" />

<line>
-Seems like a lot of explaining.

-People will get it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:15" />

<line>
Anyway, we are going to have fun

at this party!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:18" />

<line>
You said BoJack Horseman

is gonna be there?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<line>
Oh, my God. I'm so nervous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:22" />

<line>
I'm not! Every Halloween party I went to

with one of my ex-wives,

we'd get in a huge blow out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:27" />

<line>
I am so relieved that you are fun

and easygoing,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:30" />

<line>
-so there's no danger of that happening!

-Mm-hmm...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<line>
I love that we both love parties.

But more than that...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:36" />

<line>
-I love you.

-Aw, I love you, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<line>
And I love these costumes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:40" />

<line>
But tell me one more time,

what are these costumes?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:42" />

<line>
We're new social media app

sensation Tweed Feed!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<line>
It's Insta plus Snapchat...

if they both boinked Friendster,

which I guess was a thing in the '70s?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<line>
[chuckles] Believe you me.

This party is going to be dope. Booyah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<line>
It'll be off the heezy fo' sheezy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<line>
OMG, it's gonna be cray-cray!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<line>
Turnt! This is going to be

the best Halloween ever!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<line>
[theme music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
{\an8}Wow. My first fancy Hollywoo party.

"I'm ready for my close up!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<line>
{\an8}Nice!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>-Sunset Boulevard?</i>

-I usually take <i>Fountain.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
BoJack must really love Halloween

if he has this big bash every year, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<line>
Oh, yeah, he's a real fiend for the 'ween.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<line>
{\an8}[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<line>
{\an8}-Who are you and what are you doing here?

-[chuckling] Good one!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
{\an8}Pretending not to know your old friend

Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<line>
{\an8}Why are you at my house?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
{\an8}Remember when I invited you

to my Halloween party, and you said,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<line>
{\an8}you'd love to come, but couldn't

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
{\an8}because you were having

your own Halloween party?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<line>
{\an8}Well, I'm sure my guests will show up

any minute, so, you should probably go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<line>
{\an8}Well, I figured,

"Hey, why not have a crossover party?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<line>
{\an8}So, I brought my party, wait for it,

to you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
{\an8}That was the first ever <i>"Wait for it!"</i>

It's 1993!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
{\an8}-Uh...

-Come on in, guys!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<line>
-[cheering]

-[music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
-Um...

-[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<line>
{\an8}God damn it, why are you here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<line>
{\an8}At the end of last year's Halloween party,

you said, "Let's do this again next year,"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
{\an8}like you've said at every Halloween party

for the last 11 years!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<line>
[cheering, whooping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<line>
That does not sound like me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<line>
Oh, no. Mr. Peanutbutter?

Partygoers? No. Is it--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
Sure is!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<line>
Happy "Your 25-Years-Running"

Halloween Party!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<line>
-[cheering]

-Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<line>
-Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween!

-No. Don't. Please. Don't. No. You see--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<line>
So, we're having a party?

Why didn't you say this was happening?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<line>
Because I hate that it happens.

I take no action to make it happen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
{\an8}Every year, I pray that it won't happen,

and it keeps happening anyway!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<line>
{\an8}I feel like an idiot being

at a Halloween party without a costume.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
{\an8}-Who cares? I don't have a costume.

-Uh, you're wearing a costume.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<line>
Do you mean, in the sense

that we all wear costumes,

such as we reveal facets of ourselves

to those closest to us,

but our truest selves remain hidden?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<line>
No, in the sense

that you are literally wearing a costume

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
-from the TV show we both work on.

-Oh, yeah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
I'll go to Rite Aid to see

what I can arrange.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<line>
Don't let the party end

before I get back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
I definitely will let it die down!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<line>
Oh, shit, the Halloween party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<line>
-[guests chattering]

-[music playing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<line>
Oh. Hey, careful with the-- I'm sorry.

Can you put a coaster--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
-[doorbell rings]

-Can someone--?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<line>
-You! Marv's intern!

-[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
-You're on door duty.

-You got it!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
-[glass shatters]

-I'm very good at opening doors.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<line>
Do you have any candy

for trick-or-treaters?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<line>
{\an8}No. I don't know.

Just hand out these Emmy screeners.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
I'm on it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<line>
Those kids'll be holding out their hands

for Franz.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<line>
Why grip a Twix when you can Sip-o-wicz?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<line>
{\an8}What? I don't-- Just keep answering

the door until I tell you to stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<line>
-You got it, chief!

-[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<line>
-Diane! What are you supposed to be?

-An annoyed writer who hates Halloween.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<line>
Well, you are nailing it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<line>
I'm just here to drop off pages

for BoJack. How's the party?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<line>
I wouldn't know.

I'm stuck on door duty, like always.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<line>
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<line>
{\an8}Trick or treat!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<line>
No. You are way too old

to be trick-or-treating,

and way too young to be a guest

at this party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<line>
Oh, no! Why did I give you the option

of trick or treat? I just wanted treat!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<line>
Come back when you're five years older,

or three years younger.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<line>
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<line>
How 'bout now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
Okay. Come on in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<line>
-Whoa! Cool house.

-Oh, thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<line>
-It's not mine. It's my boyfriend's.

-Really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<line>
-Why does he make you answer the door?

-No, he doesn't make me, he's--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
Oh, my God. You're right! What am I doing?

What am I doing with my life?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
Uh, well, judging by your outfit,

I'd say you're a pilot of some sort?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<line>
I moved to L.A. when I was 18

and now I'm 35!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<line>
-Everything's happening so fast!

-Oh, no! I'm 18!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
Am I going to be 35 soon?

That's when they make you president!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<line>
I don't want that!

That's too much responsibility!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<line>
I can't do this anymore.

You! Take my shift!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
Oh, no!

The responsibilities are already starting!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<line>
I gotta live my life!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<line>
I deserve to be adored by a man,

yet here my dreams lie dormant!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<line>
I don't mean to get mordantly morbid,

but did I get all adorably adorned

to get bored manning doors? No more!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
Okay, this cider has not been

sufficiently alcoholed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<line>
If I'm trapped here with all you losers,

I'm at least getting drunk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<line>
[sips]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
Whoa! God! I think

somebody spiked the cider!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
[chuckles] Well, I guess

one drink won't hurt.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
No, I get that it's the<i> X-Files.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<line>
I'm just saying, what happened to the "A"

through "W" Files?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<line>
I wanna see that show. More files!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<line>
-Hey.

-Oh, hey, there you are!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<line>
Sweetheart, you disappeared

while I was in the bathroom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<line>
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just

got distracted by the fun party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<line>
But I will not leave your side agai--

Oh, my God, is that Erica?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<line>
No, no, please don't go talk to Erica.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<line>
Katrina. Erica doesn't know anybody else

at this party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<line>
It would be rude to leave her

all by herself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<line>
Well, can I at least come with you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<line>
You know Erica can't talk

to two people at once

on account of her split-brain procedure!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<line>
Why don't you go talk to, uh...

the teacher from<i> Ferris Bueller's Day Off?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<line>
Ben Stein?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<line>
I'll bet that famously boring man

is a blast at parties. I'll be right back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:35" />

<line>
-No, don't--

-Erica! Love the costume!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<line>
Where did you find such a hideous--?

Oh, my mistake, I'm so sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<line>
Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
Are you sure this is a good idea,

13-year-old Todd?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<line>
It's part of the Halloween Code.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<line>
If you don't give teenagers candy,

they're going to TP your house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<line>
[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<line>
Okay, I've scoped out the party,

and I've yet to see a single mummy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<line>
As Margaret Thatcher's children

often asked,

</line>

[imitating child]

"Is Mummy coming to see us?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
[normal]

And as their nanny always replied,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
[British accent] "Not tonight."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<line>
-Thank god.

-[normal voice] I have to ask,

what is the deal with the mummies?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<line>
Okay. I auditioned for<i> The Mummy</i> movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<line>
-The one with Brendan Fraser?

-Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<line>
And I thought everything was going well,

and then something

really traumatic happened.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<line>
-Oh, my God, what?

-I, uh... I didn't get the part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
That's it? You just didn't get it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<line>
I really wanted it!

And it still haunts me!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
It's my one major career disappointment

as of 2004,

so could you please do me

this one thing

and make sure I don't see any mummies?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<line>
I promise. No mummies.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<line>
Remember that time that lady

freaked out 'cause she saw a mummy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<line>
[BoJack and Pickles laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
-Who was that lady?

-Uh, that was actually Jessica Biel.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<line>
Who? [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<line>
-One of my ex-wives?

-Oh, yeah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<line>
You've brought so many wives

and girlfriends to these parties,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<line>
-I cannot keep track.

-Well, don't forget about Pickles, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<line>
Uh, what? Why is the waitress here

talking about pickles?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<line>
Somebody order pickles?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
No, BoJack, this is my girlfriend.

Her name is Pickles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<line>
You can remember

because if you look at me,

and don't recall my name, you'll think,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<line>
"Who is this person?

I'm in a real pickle!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<line>
And then just know that my name

is like the thing that you're in,

but with an "S" at the end.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:16" />

<line>
-What?

-I'm Pickles!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<line>
-My last name is Aplenty!

-Do I need to know this one?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<line>
-Is she gonna be around for a while?

-[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<line>
I like that you're razzing me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
It really makes me feel

like one of the gang.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<line>
If he teases you, that means he likes you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<line>
What? Is that what people think

when I tease them?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<line>
[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<line>
[sighs] Cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<line>
Remember the year

that Pinky won the costume contest,

but then it turned out he'd just lost

all his belongings in a fire,

and those clothes were all that he owned?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
-[laughing]

-[gulps] That was classic!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
Oh, shit, I gotta go run

the costume contest.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
Ow! My back! Why'd I do that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<line>
It sounds like

you all have a lot of history.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<line>
Yeah. I can't believe

we've been doing this party since '93.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
-That's the year I was born!

-I... did not realize that!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<line>
[chuckles] Hey, cheers!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<line>
-[gulps]

-[Diane sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<line>
Are you having fun?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
Yeah, I'm having a great time explaining

my costume to people over and over again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
Hey, here's a thought:

if you don't get someone's costume,

you don't need to tell them!

Just live your life!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
-Do you wanna leave?

-No, no, no, no! I'm fun!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<line>
I don't want to leave! [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<line>
I wanna leave!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:24" />

<line>
Who has the yellow military

assault vehicle blocking me in?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
-Oh, that's me!

-Since when do you drive a Hummer?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<line>
Company car.

I just like it 'cause it matches my hat.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
Plus, lots of room for the golf clubs,

and, boy, does that kitten purr.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<line>
Why don't you take her out for a spin

and see how she handles?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
What is his costume?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<line>
-Diane! Hi!

-Hey...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<line>
Am I on the hit Priscilla Barnes vehicle

<i>Three's Company</i> right now,

because three's company.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<line>
-I'm just trying to get out of here.

-Oh, my gosh, Diane,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<line>
I just want you to know that I know

that you and Mister have a history...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<line>
-"Mister?"

-And I'm fine with it,

and there's no reason we should be awkward

around each other, or jealous, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
-I'm not jealous of you.

-Okay, good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
I'm not jealous of you either,

even though you are really intimidating.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
But if we were jealous of each other,

that would be very normal,

so either way, it's totally cool.

Totally cool. [hiccups]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
Should we do shots together

to, like, celebrate

how normal we're being?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<line>
Yeah, this is a good situation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
Okay, bye, Diane!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
-Did I screw up? I'm so stupid.

-No. That's just Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<line>
She doesn't like parties

and she hates fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
-Oh!

-No, that's not fair. She used to be fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<line>
In fact, when we first started dating,

my favorite thing about her was

that she was so much more fun

than my other ex-wives.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<line>
Oh, we're talking about your exes again!

That's great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<line>
Of course, Jessica used to be fun, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<line>
That's why I started seeing her

after Katrina

because Katrina was so mean and cynical,

and Jessica was sweet and full of life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<line>
Yeah, she sounds awesome.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
But, actually, now that I think about it,

when I first met Katrina,

she was also full of life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<line>
Do you want another drink?

I'm going to get another drink.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<line>
Oh, my God. What a weird coincidence.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
Why do all these idealistic,

vivacious women eventually turn bitter

and cruel after being with me?

What's the common denominator?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<line>
-[guests chattering]

-[laughter]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<line>
Ugh. [sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<line>
-Hey, buddy.

-Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<line>
The conga line leader

accidentally led us right into the pool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<line>
I've never felt so alive!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<line>
-You should've been there!

-I want to go home now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<line>
-What? But this party is so fun!

-It's not fun for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<line>
'Cause I don't know anyone here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<line>
Of course you do. Just-- BoJack!

You remember my wife Katrina.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
-Huh? No, I do not.

-This is going great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<line>
-I'm gonna go dry off. You two chat it up.

-No, Mr. Peanutbutter, please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<line>
[exhales]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<line>
Thank you for hosting this party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<line>
So fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<line>
-What's the story on the hat?

-It's a Blossom costume.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<line>
Oh, shit, that's right! It's Halloween.

I need a costume! Good call, stranger!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<line>
Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<line>
So, I love parties, as you know,

but maybe we should go soon?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<line>
There are so many famous people here,

it's actually making me kind of anxious.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:05" />

<line>
Diane! Famous people are just

like you and me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<line>
Well, like me, because I am one.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<line>
Mom? No, I can't talk right now.

Can I call you tomorrow?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<line>
Or is this the one night a year

you emerge from your crypt?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:16" />

<line>
Go introduce yourself.

I'm sure he'd love to meet you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<line>
-Or we could just go home?

-No, come on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<line>
It's Halloween,

a night to face your fears.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<line>
That's why they call it Halloween!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<line>
So, you can wean yourself off

of having fears!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<line>
Say<i> "Hallo"</i> to weaning!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<line>
[Diane whimpers]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:33" />

<line>
Okay. Todd's Hummer is now blocked in

by a blue Tesla.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<line>
I'm looking for the owner of a blue Tesla.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<line>
Studies say buying used is actually better

for the environment,

but, hey, you tried,

and subsequently trapped me at this party!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<line>
[both] Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<line>
-Hi.

-Hi.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<line>
-So, thanks for the new script pages.

-You got it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<line>
Hey, listen. That submarine scene...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<line>
You wanna talk about it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<line>
-No?

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<line>
We'll just put that in the large bucket

of things we don't talk about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<line>
-What is that supposed to mean?

-That you didn't wanna talk about it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
[groans, grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<line>
[gulps] This party sucks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<line>
Hey, doorman! I don't have a costume.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:15" />

<line>
And I don't wanna look stupid

at my own bitchin' Halloween party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<line>
Okay, I've got an idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<line>
There. You're a one-night stand.

Get it? Nightstand?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:24" />

<line>
Nice! You should be a producer

or something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
-Ha, ha. Yeah, right!

-[doorbell neighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<line>
-But not yet. Keep manning the door.

-[sighs] Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:32" />

<line>
Ah! All dry! Sorry,

I got a little distracted on the way back

by some people with a Ouija board.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<line>
A dead soul told me to "AERXIXFASP"!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<line>
-What could it mean?

-Cool.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<line>
While you were gone,

Ben Stein introduced me to Tim Allen,

and the three of us had a long debate

about government spending,

which is exactly

how I wanted to spend my Halloween.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<line>
-I am so sorry.

-Although, I have to say,

now that your TV show has put us

into a new tax bracket,

maybe we should start

paying attention more

to how the government is using our money.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<line>
-What?

-No, I don't know, ya know,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<line>
I'm just saying

that a true capitalist-free market

is actually, if you really think about it,

more fair than an arbitrary redistribution

based on need.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<line>
-This is from <i>Ten Minutes with Tim Allen?</i>

-You left me alone for an hour and a half!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<line>
I guess time flies

when you're having fun?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<line>
-I am not having fun!

-[all gasping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:20" />

<line>
[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<line>
Hey, I need a costume.

I can't be costume-less at my own party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<line>
Mm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<line>
Hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<line>
-Follow me.

-[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<line>
-Hold that. Now circle around here.

-Oh. What--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<line>
-Okay. Just need some tape.

-No. What are-- Hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<line>
No, I get that there's a smoke monster,

but other than that,

it's just<i> Gilligan's Island,</i> right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:40" />

<line>
-[groaning]

-[Peanutbutter gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<line>
Oh, thank you so much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<line>
No!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<line>
-[woman gasps]

-[panting] Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<line>
-[glass shatters]

-[grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<line>
[groans] Jessica!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<line>
Am I written by Albert Hammond

and Diane Warren,

originally recorded by Tina Turner,

but popularized by Ace of Base?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<line>
Because "Don't Turn Around."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<line>
[slo-mo] Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<line>
[groaning]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<line>
[screaming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<line>
Mummy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<line>
[gong sound]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<line>
What do you mean, a duel?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<line>
-You mean like, like a duel, a duel?

-[clears throat]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:13" />

<line>
Hold on, somebody's--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<line>
-Baby Bjorn Borg.

-Oh, my God. Yes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:17" />

<line>
Cute. What do you want?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<line>
Oh, um, I actually wanted

to introduce yourself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<line>
I mean myself. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<line>
Obviously, you already know yourself,

so... [laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:26" />

<line>
Oh, God. Listen, I just wanted to tell you

how much I loved<i> Horsin' Around.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<line>
It was, like, a very formative part

of my childhood. So... thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<line>
I get a warm feeling every time

I think about the song.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<line>
<i>♪ Three little orphans,</i>

<i>one, two, three... ♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<line>
-I'm sorry. I'm on the phone right now.

-Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<line>
Uh... Sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<line>
Yeah, Mom, I'm still here.

No, it was nobody important.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<line>
No, I get them to Glee Club.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<line>
But why are they singing

when they're not in the Glee Club?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<line>
Where's the music coming from?

Doesn't seem realistic.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<line>
Why did you make me talk to BoJack?

I made a complete fool of myself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<line>
-No.

-I can't do this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<line>
I'm good in small groups.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<line>
I'm great in chat-rooms

and message boards.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:07" />

<line>
-[shouts] But I hate big parties!

-[record scratches]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<line>
-What? No!

-Yes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<line>
And I didn't wanna tell you because

I know how much this party means to you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<line>
[shouts] But I can't be more fun

than your ex-wives!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:16" />

<line>
It's too much pressure!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<line>
I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
-[panting]

-[door slams]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<line>
-[music playing over stereo]

-Whoo! Uh-huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<line>
-Hey, Pickles? I'm sorry.

-For what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<line>
I shouldn't talk

about my ex-wives so much.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<line>
I don't want you to feel

like you have to be fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />

<line>
But I am fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<line>
It has nothing to do with you,

or your ex-wives,

or your ex-wife Diane,

who is in this room right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
Okay, now I'm looking for the owner

of a blue Tesla,

a red Maserati, and a gold helicopter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<line>
-Let's just get out of here.

-[crying] I don't wanna get out of here!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<line>
-I'm having fun! This is fun for me!

-[record scratches]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
[sobbing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
What's up with the waitress?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<line>
You left me alone all night long!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<line>
I ask so little of you!

And you never listen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<line>
I know, but now I am listening,

and I swear I will stay by your side,

now and forever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<line>
I'll be on you like Urkel on Laura.

"Will I do that?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<line>
-Yes, I will.

-You know what? No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<line>
Because now I<i> want</i> to be alone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<line>
So, have fun hanging out with

all your hippie liberal friends, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<line>
-'Cause I'm going home.

-Kar-nina! Don't go!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<line>
Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<line>
-Party's over.

-All right, fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<line>
Let's make this an annual thing,

though, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<line>
I wanna see all of you, back here,

next year! No matter what!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
I asked you to do one thing,

keep me away from mummies.

And you couldn't even do that!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<line>
Okay, in my defense,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<line>
I am dressed like a giant notebook,

which severely limits my mobility!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<line>
How do you think I felt when I had to do

that screen test all wrapped up in gauze?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<line>
Wait. You were auditioning

to play the mummy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
Mom, I gotta go. Okay?

I'll call you tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<line>
Yeah. We will figure out Dad's funeral.

And... I'm... I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<line>
[phone beeps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<line>
-You! Boy! What's going on?

-I think the party's over, sir.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<line>
I always thought that when this happened,

I would feel something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<line>
I don't know what, but something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<line>
But I don't feel anything.

What's wrong with me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<line>
Nothing's wrong.

Just sometimes parties are over.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<line>
But... Hey, it doesn't have to be over.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<line>
I mean, I could stick around

for a little bit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<line>
Yeah, sure, good idea.

Stick around for as long as you want.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<line>
I'm sorry I ruined

another Halloween for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<line>
-You didn't ruin it.

-I really wanted you to think I was fun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<line>
Diane, you don't need to pretend

to be something you're not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<line>
-I already love you.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
And I'm going to love you,

no matter what version of you you are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<line>
So, you might as well give me

the real version.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<line>
This is good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
Now I know you don't like parties.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
So, we will never have

that argument again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<line>
Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
I really humiliated myself

in front of BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<line>
-[engine]

-If it makes you feel better,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<line>
I guarantee BoJack won't even remember

that he met you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<line>
Huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
Okay, new strategy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<line>
I'm looking for four

strong construction workers

who can lift my car

and carry it out to the street,

like in the Mentos commercial.

Any takers?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<line>
[Peanutbutter] Open the door!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<line>
[Pickles] Just leave me alone!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<line>
What's going on in there?

Tough SAT prep course?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<line>
Fail her learner's permit test?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<line>
Skirmish with the members

of the <i>Baby-Sitter's Club?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<line>
-Nope.

-Shattered dreams of playing Adelaide

in her high school's production

of<i> Guys and Dolls</i>

because the musical director sees her

as more of a Rusty Charlie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<line>
I don't know why this keeps happening.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<line>
I take these amazing women,

like Pickles, like you,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<line>
Katrina, Jessica, and I ruin them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<line>
Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<line>
I'm not <i>ruined.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
-No, I just mean... I don't listen.

-Okay, yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<line>
It is definitely very annoying

how you don't listen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
Thank you, but you don't have to say

nice things just to make me feel better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<line>
Huh? Okay, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<line>
I was going to say you not listening

and I repeat, you don't listen,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<line>
-that's not the only thing going on here.

-There are more things?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<line>
-What do all these women have in common?

-They're mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<line>
-When you first start dating them.

-They're fun?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<line>
They're young.

You keep dating women in their 20s.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
I do, do that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<line>
They're not fully-formed yet.

Life changes people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<line>
-Well, not me.

-That's kind of my point.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
You don't ruin these women,

they just grow up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<line>
So, what you're saying is...

they all grow up, but I stay the same age?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<line>
All right. All right. All right.

How do I fix that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
Well, either you date someone older...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<line>
<i>-Ooooooor...</i>

-Or, you grow up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<line>
Because otherwise,

they're gonna keep outgrowing you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<line>
Mind if I try?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
Okay, first thing we need to do

is sit you up and get you hydrated.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<line>
Thanks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<line>
I understand what you're going through.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<line>
I've been in your position before,

and this party is hard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<line>
[hiccups] It is!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<line>
It's hard to be the new girlfriend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<line>
And to be at a famous person's house,

at an event with 25 years of history,

and all these people

Mr. Peanutbutter has known for years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
-[hiccups] Plus, you're here.

-Plus, I'm here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
-What if I'm just a rebound?

-Mm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<line>
I was a rebound.

And he loved me, so much, for ten years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<line>
If there's one thing I know

about him,

it's that he loves the person he's with

deeply and unconditionally.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />

<line>
So, you don't have to worry about me,

because I'm not that person anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<line>
-You are.

-Aw. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<line>
-[door opens]

-Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<line>
-[Pickles sighs]

-If you guys will excuse me,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<line>
I'm just gonna take

this dickhole's helicopter home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<line>
-Are you okay?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<line>
I'm actually really glad you went through

all those ex-wives

because it means

I got the best version of you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<line>
-That's right. Version 4.0.

-Oh! I like the sound of that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<line>
Hey, you wanna just go home?

Hang out, just the two of us?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<line>
Psh! No way! I just saw on Tweed Feed

that Josephine's ex, Tor,

is throwing a monster shindig up in NoHo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<line>
Who-sephine's ex-what now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<line>
They have a two-story ice luge,

and a huge beer pond tournament.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<line>
And I brought new costumes,

so we don't have to look stupid wearing

the same in all our pictures.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<line>
[laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:17" />

<line>
I never wanna grow up!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<line>
[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:20" />

<line>
[sighs] Where's everybody going?

It's Halloween!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:23" />

<line>
[groaning]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
[door opens] Happy Hallowee-- What the?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<line>
-Where is everyone?

-Hey, let's do this again next year.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:35" />

<line>
I'm going to bed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:38" />

<line>
I love Halloween.
