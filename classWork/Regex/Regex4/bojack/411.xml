<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<p>
Slow down, Henrietta.

A lady mustn't rush. It's unbecoming.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<p>
I am not Henrietta! I'm your son!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<p>
My son is a ball of gas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
Yes! Your son, BoJack. I'm him.

I'm the ball of gas!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
But you're also a star.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
Wait. Mom, do you remember--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
Shh! Henrietta, I am talking to the sun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
Sun, you're a ball of gas,

but you're also a star.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<p>
-We call you... "Sun."

-Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
Where are you taking me?

Are we going to the lake house?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
No, we're going

to a glorious magical place

where they'll lock you

in a room by yourself

so you can't hurt anyone ever again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
Oh, that sounds lovely.

Why are you driving so slowly?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<p>
-Hurry up!

-Wait. You just said--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<p>
Time's arrow neither stands still

nor reverses, after all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
It merely marches forward.

Isn't that right, Henrietta?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<p>
Yes, Mrs. Horseman. That's right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<p>
[humming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<p>
Well, here we are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<p>
-Here?

-Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<p>
[humming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
Ugh!

</p>

<p>
Halt! No entry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:30" />

<p>
-But I wanna slide.

-This is no mere slide.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<p>
{\an8}We three are members

of an elite society

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<p>
{\an8}of extremely young women,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />

<p>
{\an8}led by I,

Miss Clemelia Bloodsworth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<p>
{\an8}You may not enter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:42" />

<p>
{\an8}-Yeah, and also you're fat.

-Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<p>
I'm not fat. [coughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<p>
{\an8}Even your lungs expostulate

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:48" />

<p>
{\an8}as they struggle to expel

your ample corpulence.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:51" />

<p>
{\an8}She's saying your lungs

think you're fat too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<p>
Father says I'm just growing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<p>
{\an8}If you do not halt, we will be forced

to physically impede your egress.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<p>
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me! Ow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:04" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<p>
{\an8}Beatrice, stop reading

and put on your uniform.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
{\an8}Father, I don't feel well.

[coughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<p>
I don't care if you're scared

of Clemelia Bloodsworth and her gaggle,

you have to go to school.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
{\an8}Now stop making books your friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<p>
{\an8}Reading does nothing for young women

but build their brains,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<p>
{\an8}taking valuable resources away

from their breasts and hips.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<p>
{\an8}-But my throat hurts.

-Uniform! Now!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
Beatrice? Oh, my, you're hot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
Dear Lord.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<p>
{\an8}[Joseph] Now listen here, it's

a mother's duty to keep her children alive

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<p>
{\an8}and you are continually failing!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
How could you not have known

she has scarlet fever?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
Say something, damn it!

What has become of you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
I swear if I'd known

this is how you'd behave

once we severed the connections

to your prefrontal cortex,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
I'd hardly have bothered.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
-Father?

-[gasps] Yes, darling?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
Am I to die?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
Well, eventually yes,

but this illness is but a hiccup

in what will be a long and happy life,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
-I promise.

-You promise?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
In fact, some good

may yet come of this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<p>
Doctor says your throat

is nearly swollen shut.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
So perhaps you'll finally lose

some of that weight

that's given you such troubles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
-Won't that be nice?

-Yes, Father.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
-Ow!

-Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<p>
{\an8}Polly, be a darling and fetch me

a pretty pill

and a glass of water, won't you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<p>
{\an8}Yes, Señorita Sugarman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<p>
{\an8}Beatrice, you're looking well,

which is just fine,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
{\an8}because your debutante party

is vitally important.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<p>
Will it end poverty, war and injustice,

or bring back civil rights

activist Medgar Evers,

who was shot in Mississippi

this week?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
Yes! Or rather, it will end you

worrying about that nonsense

because it will land you a husband.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<p>
{\an8}At least Evers' death means no one else

will be assassinated this year, 1963.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
The FBI is on too high alert to allow

anything like that to happen again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<p>
-Hmm?

-Yes... well...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
Your chaperone,

Corbin Creamerman,

is a fine young man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
Oh, jeez.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
-My lady. [chuckles] Here you go.

-Thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
So... uh, you look nice.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
Thank you, Corbin.

That's the third time you've told me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
You needn't tell me again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<p>
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.

I'm not always good at these things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
But sometimes I am.

I can be. I-- I really try to be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<p>
I'm, well, I-- I'm not. I'm really not.

I don't know why.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<p>
Ah, that's all right. I'm not either.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<p>
[Joseph]

Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman,

is founder of Creamerman's

Creamy Cream-based Commodities.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<p>
Think of all the free iced cream

you could, uh, serve to other people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
Father, do you aim to marry me off

to Corbin Creamerman

merely because it would be good

for business?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
Well, I suppose I do have a few ideas

of how a Sugarman/Creamerman

alliance might be advantageous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<p>
-Uh-huh.

-For example,

imagine a television advertisement

with a fun jingle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
<i>♪ Have your morning coffee or tea ♪</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
<i>♪ With Sugarman and Creamerman ♪</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<p>
<i>♪ But save some for... these fellas ♪</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<p>
And then it's Mort and me,

and we're holding up our products

with big smiles from across

a very ordinary looking kitchen table.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
Father, common Americans

don't want you on their TV sets.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
You're a reminder of the disparity

of wealth in this country.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<p>
You know, I sent you to Barnard

to get your MRS

from a fine upstanding Columbia man,

but instead of a bachelor

you returned home

with a bachelor's degree

and a mouth full of sass.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
What a waste!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<p>
-[Corbin] <i>You look nice.</i>

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
Oh, my... Beatrice Sugarman?

Doth my eye belie me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.

Why are you here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<p>
I must say,

it's tremendous you're finally debuting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
Better late than never, hmm?

[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father,

who has very old-fashioned ideas

about how a woman is to live her life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
Poor Corbin here is saddled

with chaperoning me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<p>
Oh, I don't feel saddled.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
In truth,

I find these parties to be garish,

self-serving wastes of money.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
Oh, and I'm sure yours

was particularly horrendous, Clemelia.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
[spits and coughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<p>
Oh, my! How repugnant!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
Uh... scotch on the rocks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<p>
-Do I know you?

-[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<p>
Nope, just crashing some dumb

debutante's party. [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<p>
Oh, do you mean for "dumb"

to describe the party or the debutante?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
Because I might agree with you,

or I might be offended.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<p>
You're the dumb debutante, aren't you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<p>
Beatrice Sugarman.

Welcome to my dumb party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<p>
Butterscotch Horseman.

Charmed, I'm sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<p>
You crash a lot of these?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<p>
I'll take my free alcohol

where I can get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
Saving for California.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
What's in California?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<p>
Ginsberg, Cassady, Squirrelinghetti.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
This is where you ask me

if those are towns, and I smirk at you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<p>
I am familiar with the Beats,

thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<p>
I like Ginsberg all right,

but if you ask me,

that Squirrelinghetti is nuts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<p>
-What's your interest in them?

-What's my interest?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<p>
They're the greatest minds

of our generation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<p>
I'm heading west to join them,

because I'm one of the greatest minds too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<p>
-I see.

-You will see.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
I'm writing the next

Great American Novel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
Oh, what's it about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
It's about truth! It's about war!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
It's about the twilighting frontier

of the lives that were promised us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<p>
But what is it about?

Who are the characters?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<p>
I never claimed to have

the whole thing

sorted out just yet, did I?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
Sounds like a best seller.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<p>
You're sarcastic, which is an ugly thing

for a woman to be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
I don't know how you expect

to nab a husband at a party like this

with a personality like that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
Oh, congratulations. You and my father

express the same concerns.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
[chuckles] If I were your old man,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
I'd be anxious

to get you married off, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
I bet your thank-you letters

are perfunctory,

your flower arrangements

are uninspired,

and your curtsy is an embarrassment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
-[chuckles]

-[laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<p>
Looks like you pegged me

as well as I pegged you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<p>
[clicks tongue]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
What must your mother think of you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<p>
Oh, she doesn't think much...

about anything, anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<p>
Oh. I'm sorry, did... did she pass?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<p>
-No, not exactly.

-Mine did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<p>
I'm very sorry to hear that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
I was little. I don't remember, really.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<p>
But she had a diamond just like yours.

I saw it in a picture once.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
-[BoJack] Yes, this is my mother.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<p>
I'd like to leave her here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<p>
Can I pay for the next five years now

so I don't have to think about her again?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
-Wha-- Oh.

-[Corbin] Oh, jeez, I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<p>
I'm sorry to interrupt,

but we have to do the thing now,

where we do the... things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
Oh-- oh, right. Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
-Please excuse me.

-Of course, it sounds very important.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<p>
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Sugarman

present their daughter,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
Miss Beatrice Elizabeth Sugarman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
Chaperoned by Mr. Corbin C. Creamerman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<p>
Look at her go, folks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
Clearing every hurdle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
Look at that form.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<p>
What precise movements.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<p>
-[Beatrice] Five, six...

-[man] Beautiful trot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<p>
[softly] Truly outstanding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<p>
A lovely lady indeed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<p>
-Ta-da!

-[applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
[clears throat]

Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<p>
Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
Excuse me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<p>
Don't you know it's rude to leave

without saying goodbye to the hostess?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
Why don't you come with me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<p>
It'll dispense with the need for goodbyes,

thus eliminating my transgression.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
Oh! You want me to leave

my own party with you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>

-Yeah.

wouldn't like that, would he?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<p>
[both moaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
Oh, Beatrice. [sputters]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
-I have wonderful news.

-I'm reading.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<p>
Corbin Creamerman has come to call.

He'd like to take you for a Sunday stroll.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
I am not interested

in Corbin Creamerman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
I don't give a damn

where your interests lie!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
After the disappearing act you pulled

at your own party,

you're lucky I don't fill a jar

with jellied beans

and marry you off to the man

who can closest estimate the amount.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<p>
Heavens!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
Corbin Creamerman is willing

to give you a second chance,

he is downstairs waiting,

and you <i>will</i> be civil to him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
[huffs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
And the way they make

non-dairy creamer

is by replacing the milk fat

with vegetable oil.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<p>
That's why it doesn't need refrigeration.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
-Pretty nifty, huh?

-Is that so?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
-Oh, jeez, I'm boring you.

-Not at all. I don't find <i>you</i> boring.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
Only the things you choose

to talk about,

and the way in which

you talk about them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I...

I just get excited by food chemistry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
You know, you take something

you thought you knew,

and then discover

there's so much more to it

than you could have possibly imagined.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<p>
-It's like... magic.

-Oh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<p>
My father is less enchanted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
He says it's just squeezing money

out of cow teats.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<p>
I suppose that's true,

but I got ideas too,

and I feel I never get to be anything

other than what he expects me to be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<p>
You know what that's like?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
I do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
You know, Corbin,

it occurs to me

that perhaps you and I aren't so--

Is that the only thing

you can think of to say?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<p>
[whistles]

Nice... gams.

<p>
-[sighs]

-Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
-Beatrice, what are you doing here?

-I had to look you up in the phone book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
The number you gave me

was to a pizza parlor in Brownsburg.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<p>
What? Are you sure?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
Butterscotch, I'm pregnant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<p>
-Wha--

-[whistles] Whoa, boy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
Come on, Bopper,

can you give us some privacy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<p>
Sure thing, Butterscotch.

You take it easy.

<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
[whistling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<p>
Are you certain it's mine?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
Well, whose else could it be?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<p>
What do you wanna do?

Maybe you have a cousin,

who has a... a friend,

who knows a doctor,

who can take care

of such inconveniences?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<p>
I'm-- I'm happy to do

the gentlemanly thing and...

and pay for the cab fare.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<p>
No. I can't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<p>
Well, that doesn't leave us

with very many options.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<p>
I'm a ruined woman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
Don't be hysterical.

You're not ruined.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<p>
It's a verifiable fact

you look more beautiful than ever.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<p>
[scoffs] Oh, what do you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<p>
It was a pretty great night

we had together, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<p>
It was.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<p>
Say, did you ever hear the story

of the couple who moved to California?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<p>
I can't say that I have.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<p>
Oh, it's a marvelous adventure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<p>
You see, they hardly knew each other,

but they shared a certain sensitivity

and a taste for the unknown.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
They were living in a one-horse town,

so they headed west,

towards a town that could

accommodate three horses.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
Oh, yes, I think I <i>have</i> heard this story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
They got a small house

in San Francisco near the bookstore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<p>
He got in good with Squirrelinghetti

and his scurry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<p>
He wrote his Great American Novel...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
While his wife took care of the baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
His wife?

Oh, well, I didn't hear about that part.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
Well, if she'd have him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
If a beautiful creature like herself

could ever love an oaf like him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
-I think she could.

-Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

And isn't that how the story goes?

I tried. He won't eat.

<p>
Well, can you figure it out?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

If I don't sleep, how can I work

to support you and the child,

instead of breaking your back

all day at the cannery,

and then maybe you could afford me

some decent help around here?

<p>
You want me to work for your father,

<p>
Oh, he would have.

And he would have been kind to me.

And he wouldn't have been

too much of a stubborn ass

to take a decent job

at my father's company!

Fine! I'll take the corner office,

<p>
It would only depress me

to watch you bumble around like that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<p>
All the sacrifices I made,

so that you could do this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<p>
Thanks for the painting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
It'll be nice to have something that

always reminds me of this conversation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
[screams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
[screaming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<p>
[clearing throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<p>
-Uh, Beatrice.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<p>
I, uh--

[clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
-I gummed things up. [nervous chuckle]

-Oh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<p>
It's Henrietta.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
The girl went and got herself pregnant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<p>
Oh, she got herself pregnant?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<p>
Can you talk to her?

Just woman to woman?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
She wants to have the baby.

I-- I can't talk her out of it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<p>
-What do you want me to say?

-I'm out of options, Bea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
You think I enjoy groveling

to my own wife, hat in hand?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<p>
If you weren't so neglectful

in your wifely duties...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
-Don't you dare.

-I'm sorry. What do--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<p>
I don't know what to do. I...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
Please. Just--

just fix this for me, please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<p>
I know you hate me, Bea,

but please just think of the poor girl.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
[exhales] Oh, God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<p>
You're fired, of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<p>
He was just so kind to me

and I felt so--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<p>
Let me guess, he said you reminded him

of his dead mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
He said she had hair like mine.

He saw it in a picture once.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<p>
-Do you really want this child?

-I... I think so?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<p>
It's a baby horse.

[chuckles] A girl.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<p>
I need help. I'm studying to be a nurse,

and tuition keeps going up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
None of that is my fault.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<p>
If I can just finish school

and get a job, it'll be okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<p>
And who's going to care

for the baby while you work?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
Because God knows he won't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
[sobbing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
Well, don't do that.

What does that solve?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<p>
I don't know what else to do,

Mrs. Horseman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<p>
All right. We'll pay for your tuition.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
-Really?

-Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<p>
And you'll give the baby up

for adoption.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<p>
[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<p>
You think you want this,

but you don't. Not like this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<p>
Mrs. Horseman--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
Don't throw away your dreams

for this child.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
Don't let that man poison your life

the way he did mine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
You are going to finish your schooling

and become a nurse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<p>
You'll meet a man, a good man,

and you'll have a family,

but please believe me,

you don't want this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
Please, Henrietta,

you have to believe me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<p>
Please, don't do what I did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<p>
Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
[panting and grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
[screaming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<p>
[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<p>
[screaming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<p>
My-- My baby!

Where's my baby?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<p>
[screaming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
[crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
[screaming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<p>
[crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
-Oh, look at you.

-[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<p>
-You did it, Henrietta.

-[panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<p>
Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<p>
[humming]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
No, no, no. No, please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
Please don't. Stop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<p>
Stop! Why are you doing this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<p>
Beatrice, remember

what we say about crying?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
-Mm-hmm.

-Crying is stupid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<p>
But, Father,

tell them not to burn my things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<p>
But, darling, they have to.

Your sickness has infected everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
The hard part is over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<p>
Wait. Wait. I wanna hold her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<p>
-No. You'll get attached.

-Wait!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
It all must be destroyed

for your own good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<p>
-I need to hold her.

-This is for your own good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
-But not my baby.

-Yes. Especially your baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
-Whoop!

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<p>
See, doesn't that feel better?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<p>
[Beatrice cries] No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
My baby!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<p>
Wait, please. I need to hold her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
-No, no.

-[crying]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<p>
Wait. No, please come back.

I need to hold her. Please.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
[screams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<p>
No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<p>
Come on now, be strong.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<p>
You can't let your womanly emotions

consume you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<p>
You don't wanna end up

like your mother now, do you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
[faint screaming in distance]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<p>
-[sobs] No.

-I promise.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
One day this will

all be a pleasant memory.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
Best of luck. See ya never.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
-Who <i>is</i> that?

-[groans] Bye, Mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<p>
BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<p>
-Mom?

-BoJack? Is that you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
Yeah, it's me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<p>
-Well, oh, what is this place?

-This is where you live now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<p>
-No. Is it? No.

-Mom...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
-Where are we, BoJack?

-I just told you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
I don't understand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />

<p>
-Where... Where am I?

-You're...

in Michigan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<p>
-Michigan?

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<p>
-At the lake house.

-I am?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<p>
It's a-- It's a warm summer night,

and the fireflies are dancing

in the sky.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<p>
And your whole family is here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:11" />

<p>
And they're telling you

that everything is gonna be all right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<p>
Yes. That's right. What else?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
The crickets are-- are chirping,

and the lake is still,

and the night is full of stars.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<p>
I can see it. It's so clear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<p>
What are we doing here, BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<p>
We're sitting on the back porch,

and we're listening to your brother

play the piano,

and we're eating ice cream.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:37" />

<p>
Vanilla ice cream.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:39" />

<p>
Yes. That's right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:41" />

<p>
Oh, it's all so marvelous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:44" />

<p>
Can you taste the ice cream, Mom?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:45" />

<p>
Oh, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:47" />

<p>
It's so...

delicious.
