Slow down, Henrietta.

A lady mustn't rush. It's unbecoming.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
I am not Henrietta! I'm your son!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<line>
My son is a ball of gas.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<line>
Yes! Your son, BoJack. I'm him.

I'm the ball of gas!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<line>
But you're also a star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<line>
Wait. Mom, do you remember--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<line>
Shh! Henrietta, I am talking to the sun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<line>
Sun, you're a ball of gas,

but you're also a star.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<line>
-We call you... "Sun."

-Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<line>
Where are you taking me?

Are we going to the lake house?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<line>
No, we're going

to a glorious magical place

where they'll lock you

in a room by yourself

so you can't hurt anyone ever again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<line>
Oh, that sounds lovely.

Why are you driving so slowly?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<line>
-Hurry up!

-Wait. You just said--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<line>
Time's arrow neither stands still

nor reverses, after all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<line>
It merely marches forward.

Isn't that right, Henrietta?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
Yes, Mrs. Horseman. That's right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<line>
[humming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
Well, here we are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<line>
-Here?

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
[humming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<line>
Ugh!

Halt! No entry.

<timestamp data-time="00:02:30" />

<line>
-But I wanna slide.

-This is no mere slide.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<line>
{\an8}We three are members

of an elite society

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<line>
{\an8}of extremely young women,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />

<line>
{\an8}led by I,

Miss Clemelia Bloodsworth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<line>
{\an8}You may not enter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:42" />

<line>
{\an8}-Yeah, and also you're fat.

-Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<line>
I'm not fat. [coughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<line>
{\an8}Even your lungs expostulate

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:48" />

<line>
{\an8}as they struggle to expel

your ample corpulence.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:51" />

<line>
{\an8}She's saying your lungs

think you're fat too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<line>
Father says I'm just growing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<line>
{\an8}If you do not halt, we will be forced

to physically impede your egress.

<line>
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me! Ow!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:04" />

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<line>
{\an8}Beatrice, stop reading

and put on your uniform.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
{\an8}Father, I don't feel well.

[coughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<line>
I don't care if you're scared

of Clemelia Bloodsworth and her gaggle,

you have to go to school.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<line>
{\an8}Now stop making books your friends.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<line>
{\an8}Reading does nothing for young women

but build their brains,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<line>
{\an8}taking valuable resources away

from their breasts and hips.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<line>
{\an8}-But my throat hurts.

-Uniform! Now!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
Beatrice? Oh, my, you're hot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<line>
Dear Lord.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<line>
{\an8}[Joseph] Now listen here, it's

a mother's duty to keep her children alive

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<line>
{\an8}and you are continually failing!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<line>
How could you not have known

she has scarlet fever?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
Say something, damn it!

What has become of you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<line>
I swear if I'd known

this is how you'd behave

once we severed the connections

to your prefrontal cortex,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
I'd hardly have bothered.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<line>
-Father?

-[gasps] Yes, darling?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<line>
Am I to die?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<line>
Well, eventually yes,

but this illness is but a hiccup

in what will be a long and happy life,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
-I promise.

-You promise?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
In fact, some good

may yet come of this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<line>
Doctor says your throat

is nearly swollen shut.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<line>
So perhaps you'll finally lose

some of that weight

that's given you such troubles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<line>
-Won't that be nice?

-Yes, Father.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
-Ow!

-Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<line>
{\an8}Polly, be a darling and fetch me

a pretty pill

and a glass of water, won't you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<line>
{\an8}Yes, Señorita Sugarman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
{\an8}Beatrice, you're looking well,

which is just fine,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<line>
{\an8}because your debutante party

is vitally important.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<line>
Will it end poverty, war and injustice,

or bring back civil rights

activist Medgar Evers,

who was shot in Mississippi

this week?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<line>
Yes! Or rather, it will end you

worrying about that nonsense

because it will land you a husband.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
{\an8}At least Evers' death means no one else

will be assassinated this year, 1963.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<line>
The FBI is on too high alert to allow

anything like that to happen again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
-Hmm?

-Yes... well...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<line>
Your chaperone,

Corbin Creamerman,

is a fine young man.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<line>
Oh, jeez.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
-My lady. [chuckles] Here you go.

-Thanks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
So... uh, you look nice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<line>
Thank you, Corbin.

That's the third time you've told me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<line>
You needn't tell me again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<line>
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.

I'm not always good at these things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
But sometimes I am.

I can be. I-- I really try to be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<line>
I'm, well, I-- I'm not. I'm really not.

I don't know why.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
Ah, that's all right. I'm not either.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<line>
[Joseph]

Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman,

is founder of Creamerman's

Creamy Cream-based Commodities.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<line>
Think of all the free iced cream

you could, uh, serve to other people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<line>
Father, do you aim to marry me off

to Corbin Creamerman

merely because it would be good

for business?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
Well, I suppose I do have a few ideas

of how a Sugarman/Creamerman

alliance might be advantageous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<line>
-Uh-huh.

-For example,

imagine a television advertisement

with a fun jingle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
<i>♪ Have your morning coffee or tea ♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
<i>♪ With Sugarman and Creamerman ♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<line>
<i>♪ But save some for... these fellas ♪</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<line>
And then it's Mort and me,

and we're holding up our products

with big smiles from across

a very ordinary looking kitchen table.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<line>
Father, common Americans

don't want you on their TV sets.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<line>
You're a reminder of the disparity

of wealth in this country.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<line>
Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<line>
You know, I sent you to Barnard

to get your MRS

from a fine upstanding Columbia man,

but instead of a bachelor

you returned home

with a bachelor's degree

and a mouth full of sass.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<line>
What a waste!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<line>
-[Corbin] <i>You look nice.</i>

-Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<line>
Oh, my... Beatrice Sugarman?

Doth my eye belie me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<line>
Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.

Why are you here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<line>
I must say,

it's tremendous you're finally debuting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<line>
Better late than never, hmm?

[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<line>
Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father,

who has very old-fashioned ideas

about how a woman is to live her life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<line>
Poor Corbin here is saddled

with chaperoning me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<line>
Oh, I don't feel saddled.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<line>
In truth,

I find these parties to be garish,

self-serving wastes of money.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
Oh, and I'm sure yours

was particularly horrendous, Clemelia.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
[spits and coughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<line>
Oh, my! How repugnant!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<line>
Uh... scotch on the rocks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<line>
-Do I know you?

-[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<line>
Nope, just crashing some dumb

debutante's party. [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<line>
Oh, do you mean for "dumb"

to describe the party or the debutante?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<line>
Because I might agree with you,

or I might be offended.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<line>
You're the dumb debutante, aren't you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<line>
Beatrice Sugarman.

Welcome to my dumb party.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<line>
Butterscotch Horseman.

Charmed, I'm sure.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<line>
You crash a lot of these?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
I'll take my free alcohol

where I can get it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
Saving for California.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<line>
What's in California?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:46" />

<line>
Ginsberg, Cassady, Squirrelinghetti.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<line>
This is where you ask me

if those are towns, and I smirk at you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<line>
I am familiar with the Beats,

thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
I like Ginsberg all right,

but if you ask me,

that Squirrelinghetti is nuts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<line>
-What's your interest in them?

-What's my interest?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<line>
They're the greatest minds

of our generation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<line>
I'm heading west to join them,

because I'm one of the greatest minds too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<line>
-I see.

-You will see.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<line>
I'm writing the next

Great American Novel.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<line>
Oh, what's it about?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<line>
It's about truth! It's about war!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
It's about the twilighting frontier

of the lives that were promised us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<line>
But what is it about?

Who are the characters?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<line>
I never claimed to have

the whole thing

sorted out just yet, did I?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<line>
Sounds like a best seller.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<line>
You're sarcastic, which is an ugly thing

for a woman to be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<line>
I don't know how you expect

to nab a husband at a party like this

with a personality like that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<line>
Oh, congratulations. You and my father

express the same concerns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<line>
[chuckles] If I were your old man,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<line>
I'd be anxious

to get you married off, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<line>
I bet your thank-you letters

are perfunctory,

your flower arrangements

are uninspired,

and your curtsy is an embarrassment.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<line>
-[chuckles]

-[laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<line>
Looks like you pegged me

as well as I pegged you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<line>
[clicks tongue]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<line>
What must your mother think of you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<line>
Oh, she doesn't think much...

about anything, anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<line>
Oh. I'm sorry, did... did she pass?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:57" />

<line>
-No, not exactly.

-Mine did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<line>
I'm very sorry to hear that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<line>
I was little. I don't remember, really.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
But she had a diamond just like yours.

I saw it in a picture once.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<line>
Oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
-[BoJack] Yes, this is my mother.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<line>
I'd like to leave her here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<line>
Can I pay for the next five years now

so I don't have to think about her again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<line>
-Wha-- Oh.

-[Corbin] Oh, jeez, I--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:17" />

<line>
I'm sorry to interrupt,

but we have to do the thing now,

where we do the... things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<line>
Oh-- oh, right. Um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<line>
-Please excuse me.

-Of course, it sounds very important.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph Sugarman

present their daughter,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
Miss Beatrice Elizabeth Sugarman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<line>
Chaperoned by Mr. Corbin C. Creamerman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<line>
Look at her go, folks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<line>
Clearing every hurdle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
Look at that form.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<line>
What precise movements.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
-[Beatrice] Five, six...

-[man] Beautiful trot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<line>
[softly] Truly outstanding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<line>
A lovely lady indeed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<line>
-Ta-da!

-[applause]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<line>
[clears throat]

Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<line>
Oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<line>
Excuse me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<line>
Don't you know it's rude to leave

without saying goodbye to the hostess?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<line>
Why don't you come with me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
It'll dispense with the need for goodbyes,

thus eliminating my transgression.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<line>
Oh! You want me to leave

my own party with you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>

-Yeah.

wouldn't like that, would he?

</line>

<line>
[both moaning]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<line>
Oh, Beatrice. [sputters]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<line>
-I have wonderful news.

-I'm reading.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<line>
Corbin Creamerman has come to call.

He'd like to take you for a Sunday stroll.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<line>
I am not interested

in Corbin Creamerman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
I don't give a damn

where your interests lie!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
After the disappearing act you pulled

at your own party,

you're lucky I don't fill a jar

with jellied beans

and marry you off to the man

who can closest estimate the amount.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<line>
Heavens!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<line>
Corbin Creamerman is willing

to give you a second chance,

he is downstairs waiting,

and you <i>will</i> be civil to him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<line>
[huffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<line>
And the way they make

non-dairy creamer

is by replacing the milk fat

with vegetable oil.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<line>
That's why it doesn't need refrigeration.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
-Pretty nifty, huh?

-Is that so?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
-Oh, jeez, I'm boring you.

-Not at all. I don't find <i>you</i> boring.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<line>
Only the things you choose

to talk about,

and the way in which

you talk about them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I...

I just get excited by food chemistry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<line>
You know, you take something

you thought you knew,

and then discover

there's so much more to it

than you could have possibly imagined.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
-It's like... magic.

-Oh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<line>
My father is less enchanted.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<line>
He says it's just squeezing money

out of cow teats.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
I suppose that's true,

but I got ideas too,

and I feel I never get to be anything

other than what he expects me to be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<line>
You know what that's like?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<line>
I do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
You know, Corbin,

it occurs to me

that perhaps you and I aren't so--

<line>
[whistles]

Nice... gams.

<line>
-[sighs]

-Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<line>
-Beatrice, what are you doing here?

-I had to look you up in the phone book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
The number you gave me

was to a pizza parlor in Brownsburg.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<line>
What? Are you sure?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
Butterscotch, I'm pregnant.

<line>
-Wha--

-[whistles] Whoa, boy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<line>
Come on, Bopper,

can you give us some privacy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
Sure thing, Butterscotch.

You take it easy.

[whistling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

Are you certain it's mine?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>
Well, whose else could it be?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<line>
What do you wanna do?

Maybe you have a cousin,

who has a... a friend,

who knows a doctor,

who can take care

of such inconveniences?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
I'm-- I'm happy to do

the gentlemanly thing and...

and pay for the cab fare.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<line>
No. I can't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<line>
Well, that doesn't leave us

with very many options.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<line>
I'm a ruined woman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<line>
Don't be hysterical.

You're not ruined.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
It's a verifiable fact

you look more beautiful than ever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<line>
[scoffs] Oh, what do you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:00" />

<line>
It was a pretty great night

we had together, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<line>
It was.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<line>
Say, did you ever hear the story

of the couple who moved to California?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<line>
I can't say that I have.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
Oh, it's a marvelous adventure.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<line>
You see, they hardly knew each other,

but they shared a certain sensitivity

and a taste for the unknown.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<line>
They were living in a one-horse town,

so they headed west,

towards a town that could

accommodate three horses.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<line>
Oh, yes, I think I <i>have</i> heard this story.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
They got a small house

in San Francisco near the bookstore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<line>
He got in good with Squirrelinghetti

and his scurry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<line>
He wrote his Great American Novel...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<line>
While his wife took care of the baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
His wife?

Oh, well, I didn't hear about that part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
Well, if she'd have him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<line>
If a beautiful creature like herself

could ever love an oaf like him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<line>
-I think she could.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

I tried. He won't eat.

Well, can you figure it out?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

If I don't sleep, how can I work

to support you and the child,

all day at the cannery,

and then maybe you could afford me

some decent help around here?

You want me to work for your father,

<line>
Oh, he would have.

And he would have been kind to me.

And he wouldn't have been

at my father's company!

Fine! I'll take the corner office,

<line>
It would only depress me

to watch you bumble around like that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<line>
All the sacrifices I made,

so that you could do this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
Thanks for the painting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<line>
It'll be nice to have something that

always reminds me of this conversation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<line>
[screams]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<line>
[screaming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<line>
[clearing throat]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<line>
-Uh, Beatrice.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
I, uh--

[clears throat]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<line>
-I gummed things up. [nervous chuckle]

-Oh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:43" />

<line>
It's Henrietta.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<line>
The girl went and got herself pregnant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:47" />

<line>
Oh, she got herself pregnant?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
Can you talk to her?

Just woman to woman?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<line>
She wants to have the baby.

I-- I can't talk her out of it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<line>
-What do you want me to say?

-I'm out of options, Bea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<line>
You think I enjoy groveling

to my own wife, hat in hand?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<line>
If you weren't so neglectful

in your wifely duties...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<line>
-Don't you dare.

-I'm sorry. What do--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<line>
I don't know what to do. I...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<line>
Please. Just--

just fix this for me, please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<line>
I know you hate me, Bea,

but please just think of the poor girl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<line>
[exhales] Oh, God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<line>
You're fired, of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
He was just so kind to me

and I felt so--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<line>
Let me guess, he said you reminded him

of his dead mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<line>
He said she had hair like mine.

He saw it in a picture once.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<line>
-Do you really want this child?

-I... I think so?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<line>
It's a baby horse.

[chuckles] A girl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
I need help. I'm studying to be a nurse,

and tuition keeps going up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<line>
None of that is my fault.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<line>
If I can just finish school

and get a job, it'll be okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<line>
And who's going to care

for the baby while you work?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<line>
Because God knows he won't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<line>
[sobbing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
Well, don't do that.

What does that solve?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<line>
I don't know what else to do,

Mrs. Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<line>
All right. We'll pay for your tuition.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<line>
-Really?

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<line>
And you'll give the baby up

for adoption.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<line>
No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
You think you want this,

but you don't. Not like this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<line>
Mrs. Horseman--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<line>
Don't throw away your dreams

for this child.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<line>
Don't let that man poison your life

the way he did mine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<line>
You are going to finish your schooling

and become a nurse.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<line>
You'll meet a man, a good man,

and you'll have a family,

but please believe me,

you don't want this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<line>
Oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<line>
Please, Henrietta,

you have to believe me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:39" />

<line>
Please, don't do what I did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<line>
[panting and grunting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<line>
[screaming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<line>
[panting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<line>
[screaming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<line>
My-- My baby!

Where's my baby?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<line>
[screaming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<line>
[crying]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<line>
[screaming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<line>
[crying]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
-Oh, look at you.

-[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<line>
-You did it, Henrietta.

-[panting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<line>
Oh, my God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<line>
[humming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
No, no, no. No, please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<line>
Please don't. Stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<line>
Stop! Why are you doing this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
Beatrice, remember

what we say about crying?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<line>
-Mm-hmm.

-Crying is stupid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
But, Father,

tell them not to burn my things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<line>
But, darling, they have to.

Your sickness has infected everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
The hard part is over.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<line>
Wait. Wait. I wanna hold her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<line>
-No. You'll get attached.

-Wait!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<line>
It all must be destroyed

for your own good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<line>
-I need to hold her.

-This is for your own good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<line>
-But not my baby.

-Yes. Especially your baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<line>
-Whoop!

-[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
See, doesn't that feel better?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
[Beatrice cries] No!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<line>
My baby!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<line>
Wait, please. I need to hold her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<line>
-No, no.

-[crying]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<line>
Wait. No, please come back.

I need to hold her. Please.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<line>
[screams]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:04" />

<line>
No!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<line>
Come on now, be strong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<line>
You can't let your womanly emotions

consume you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<line>
You don't wanna end up

like your mother now, do you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<line>
[faint screaming in distance]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<line>
-[sobs] No.

-I promise.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
One day this will

all be a pleasant memory.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<line>
Best of luck. See ya never.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<line>
-Who <i>is</i> that?

-[groans] Bye, Mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<line>
-Mom?

-BoJack? Is that you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<line>
Yeah, it's me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<line>
-Well, oh, what is this place?

-This is where you live now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<line>
-No. Is it? No.

-Mom...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<line>
-Where are we, BoJack?

-I just told you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<line>
I don't understand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />

<line>
-Where... Where am I?

-You're...

in Michigan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<line>
-Michigan?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<line>
-At the lake house.

-I am?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<line>
It's a-- It's a warm summer night,

and the fireflies are dancing

in the sky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<line>
And your whole family is here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:11" />

<line>
And they're telling you

that everything is gonna be all right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<line>
Yes. That's right. What else?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<line>
The crickets are-- are chirping,

and the lake is still,

and the night is full of stars.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<line>
I can see it. It's so clear.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
What are we doing here, BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<line>
We're sitting on the back porch,

and we're listening to your brother

play the piano,

and we're eating ice cream.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:37" />

<line>
Vanilla ice cream.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:39" />

<line>
Yes. That's right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:41" />

<line>
Oh, it's all so marvelous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:44" />

<line>
Can you taste the ice cream, Mom?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:45" />

<line>
Oh, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:47" />

<line>
It's so...

delicious.
