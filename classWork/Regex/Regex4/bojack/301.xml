[BoJack]

<i>It's a dream come true.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:09" />

<p>
[woman] <i>You've been trying to get</i>

<i>this movie made for 20 years.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<p>
<i>Did you ever think you'd be sitting here,</i>

<i>talking about</i> Secretariat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<p>
Sitting here? In this hotel room?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<p>
[clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
It's a dream come true.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<p>
What's it like to play Secretariat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
Dream come true.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<p>
Playing Secretariat, what was that like?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<p>
Dream come true.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
[woman]

<i>How long you in New York for?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<p>
Just a couple days of fun interviews,

then it's off to Chicago

for more fun interviews,

and then, if I don't blow my brains out,

I get to go back to L.A.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
Darling, you're doing marvelously,

I am so proud of you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<p>
If I could make one slight adjustment?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
Maybe fewer jokes

about how these interviews

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<p>
- make you want to blow your brains out?

- Right. Sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
I am so thrilled to be here,

talking with, uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<p>
-Yahoo Finland.

-Yahoo Finland.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:53" />

<p>
- Are you Finnish?

- No, we are just getting started.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
Walked right into that one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<p>
What would an Oscar nomination

mean for Mr. BoJack Horseman?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<p>
Any award recognition is just gravy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<p>
The real joy is to sit

in this hotel room all day,

answering the same questions

over and over again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<p>
Great answers, you're divine.

I'm in love with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
One small adjustment.

I don't think sarcasm is going to read.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<p>
Just write a script for me,

so I don't have to think for myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<p>
Honey, I would shove my hand

up your ass

and control your mouth like a Muppet

if it would win you an Oscar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:22" />

<p>
What do I know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<p>
I'm just the publicist you hired

to help win you an Oscar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:26" />

<p>
[woman]

<i>What's it like to play Seabiscuit?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<p>
I don't know.

You'd have to ask Tobey Maguire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<p>
[man] Your last attempt at a comeback

was <i>The BoJack Horseman Show.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:34" />

<p>
Pass.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:35" />

<p>
[man 2] People still see you as the guy

from that sucky show from the '90s.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<p>
<i>Horsin' Around </i>was not a sucky show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<p>
- Yeah, but it was.

- It lasted nine seasons.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:43" />

<p>
Its whole purpose

was for people to watch it

so the network could sell ad time,

so the show could make more money

than it cost to produce.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:49" />

<p>
It did that well. It was a good show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:51" />

<p>
- Yes, but it sucked.

- It didn't suck!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<p>
Great job today.

It could not have gone better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:58" />

<p>
My only note would be

stop defending <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<p>
Why? Millions of people loved it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:03" />

<p>
We need to use these next few months

to define your story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<p>
When people see you

they need to think Oscar winner,

not dumb asshole from an old TV show

that nobody cares about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<p>
Okay, I hear what you're saying,

but we can both agree <i>Horsin' Around</i>

was a good show, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:17" />

<p>
BoJack, you know

I think the world of you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:19" />

<p>
I think you are so smart and attractive,

so I'm not going to mince words.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:23" />

<p>
<i>Horsin' Around </i>was a piece of shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:27" />

<p>
{\an8}Looking good. Fantastic.

You need a coaster.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<p>
{\an8}I told you to wear lipstick

and underpants, Teresa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
{\an8}I put everything bill-related

in one folder.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<p>
{\an8}Gas bill, cable bill,

and the new headshots for Billy Zane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
- Thank you, Judah.

- You also wanted me to remind you

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<p>
- to call Mr. Peanutbutter.

- Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
Ping me again in two minutes?

No, five minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
Uh, when's our call

with BoJack and Spanakopita?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<p>
{\an8}The one that started seven minutes ago?

It started seven minutes ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
{\an8}What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<p>
{\an8}Diane's in your office right now,

stalling... poorly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
{\an8}And that is my opinion on the Octomom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
{\an8}Remember Octomom?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
{\an8}[Ana] <i>Diane, are you stalling</i>

<i>for Princess Carolyn?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
{\an8}What? You know who was good at stallin'

was Joseph Stalin. [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
[BoJack] <i>If anything,</i>

<i>Stalin was ruthlessly efficient.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
<i>Get your head out of your ass.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<p>
{\an8}He also had a city named after him.

Isn't that right, Princess Carolyn,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
{\an8}- who's been here the whole time?

- Hey, buddy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
{\an8}How was your first big day

at the press junket?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<p>
{\an8}[sighs] Endless. It was like

the second act of a Judd Apatow movie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<p>
He was exquisite.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<p>
The movie's tracking really well

on social.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
New media impressions are up

23 percent across platforms.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<p>
What does that mean?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<p>
Oh, I have no idea.

I assumed you would know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
[clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<p>
{\an8}But I keep tweeting things

and they keep getting retweeted,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
{\an8}so we're doing something right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<p>
Yesterday I dropped my phone

in the bathroom

which made BoJack's Instagram

post a picture of the floor,

with the caption "<i>spujb."</i>

That got 4000 likes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<p>
{\an8}- [Ana] <i>Great.</i>

- I am exhausted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<p>
{\an8}Being a movie star is the hardest job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<p>
{\an8}And we get no recognition.

[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
Okay, you're gonna love this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<p>
I pulled some strings at <i>Manatee Fair</i>

and set up an interview tomorrow night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:52" />

<p>
BoJack is not ready

for a magazine feature.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
Relax. It's not that big a deal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<p>
I didn't realize

you were an authority on deal size.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
[Princess Carolyn]

<i>Listen, Moussaka...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<p>
{\an8}Ladies, please.

There's plenty of BoJack to go around.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<p>
I can do all the bullshit things

Ana's scheduled for me in the morning

and still have time for Princess Carolyn's

bullshit thing tomorrow night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<p>
Now, pajamas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<p>
- Whaa!

- [gasping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<p>
- Todd?!

- <i>What is going on over there?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
[Ana] <i>BoJack smuggled</i>

<i>a young boy into his room.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<p>
No big deal.

Movie stars do it all the time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<p>
{\an8}Where am I? [sniffs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
{\an8}Bagels? Pizza?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<p>
{\an8}[sniffing] Hipsters? Urine?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
{\an8}- Am I in Minneapolis?

- What? No, you're in New York.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<p>
{\an8}Follow-up: why are you in New York?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
{\an8}Beats me. Sometimes I just am places.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

</p>

<p>
Yeah, that'll do it.

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
Is my name Sarah Koenig?

Because I'm about to get cereal.

I am the queen.

<p>
Follow me, citizens.

- [screaming]

</p>

<p>
You better not have gotten

your failure stink

all over my important movie star clothes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
- Ohh...

- I didn't mean that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
You're my friend

and you don't stink of failure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<p>
Your stink is one of good intentions

and youthful exuberance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<p>
[Todd]

<i>Hooray, compliment!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<p>
You wanted me to ping you

regarding Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
Oh, fish! Guys, hold on,

I have to make a quick call.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<p>
- What? You're already on a call.

- <i>Sorry.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
- Please hold.

- [Ana] <i>This is ridiculous.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
- Hello?

- [Princess Carolyn] <i>It's your agent!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<p>
I wanted to remind you

of your meeting with Pinky today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<p>
I think I'm already in it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<p>
[annoyed throat clearing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
- Do I need to be on this call still?

- I put you on conference. How do I...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
- BoJack Horseman, is that you?!

- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
Hey buddy, loved that bathroom floor pic

you posted yesterday.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:57" />

<p>
<i>Spujb! </i>Classic BoJack.

<p>
<i>We should get together sometime</i>

<i>and take a selfie.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
I'd love to, buddy,

but I'm kinda in New York right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<p>
[Peanutbutter] <i>New York City?!</i>

<i>They make such great salsa.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<p>
I'm here too, honey.

Have a great meeting!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
Diane?! Wait, you went to New York?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<p>
- [Diane] <i>No. I'm just on--</i>

- Why wouldn't you tell me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<p>
How long are you-- I'm not accusing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
<i>I just... I feel safer when I know</i>

<i>that I know where you are.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<p>
- I affirm your feelings...

- [BoJack] <i>I don't want to--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<p>
...your feelings have value,

but I'm not in New York,

I'm just on the conference call.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
- Guys, can we...

- [Peanutbutter]<i> I feel heard.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
- [Diane] <i>I hear that you feel heard.</i>

- What the hell is happening?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<p>
- Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, I'm in New York!

- <i>What?!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<p>
[Todd] <i>As Carrie from</i>

Sex and the City <i>might say...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<p>
<i>- I'm Carrie.</i>

- [Peanutbutter] <i>Todd? In the naked city?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<p>
[chuckling] <i>That is going to lead</i>

<i>to some wackiness. You mark my words.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
Would you guys literally mark my words?

I do want to refer back to this later on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:51" />

<p>
We're in the middle of a meeting!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<p>
[Peanutbutter] G<i>ot to go.</i>

<i>It's always "Rabbit, Run" with this guy.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<p>
Right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
Oh, yeah. Somebody did their research

on J.D. Salinger.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<p>
<i>Rabbit, Run?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<p>
- <i>That's Updike, you illiterate.</i>

- What's Updike?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<p>
Not much, dyke, what's up with you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<p>
Is "dyke" an okay thing to say now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<p>
<i>Has it been reclaimed?</i>

<i>I honestly can't keep track.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
- Who are you asking?

- [Ana] <i>We're hanging up now, goodbye.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<p>
Wow! BoJack and Todd in the Big Apple.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
I want to find one of those fortune

telling robots that can make me big!

<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<p>
Hey, champ,

I have a very important job for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
Why don't you go get us some ice?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<p>
You don't need to patronize me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<p>
- But, yeah, I can do that important job.

- [BoJack] Don't get lost, buddy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
I'm not gonna get lost.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
The city's on a grid, why would I get...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<p>
Oh, no.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:45" />

<p>
Hello? Are you still there?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
- They may have hung up.

- I have some good news for once.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:50" />

<p>
I just got promoted

to head of programming.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
I'm no longer a passenger

on the burning wreckage of an industry

that is broadcast television.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
- I'm a captain!

- What happened to Wanda?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<p>
You didn't hear? She got poached.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<p>
- Oh, God!

- By another company.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
Oh, good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
- They shot her.

Anyway, the network

is finally breaking even,

thanks to the runaway success

of <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
<i>What Do They Know?</i>

<i>Do They Know Things? Let's Find Out!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
Not to mention its companion show

<p>
- So as long as you two stick around...

- I'm taking the show off the air.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<p>
Wait, what? Why?!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
I told the story I wanted to tell.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<p>
To prolong it for commercial reasons

would be crass and inorganic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>

what Hollywoo stars and celebrities know

</p>

<p>
- and what they don't know.

- [moaning]

<p>
- Well, we found out.

- This is a nightmare.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<p>
Why does everything I love fall apart

as soon as I touch it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<p>
Oh, my ex-wife was right about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<p>
Or are we living in the ghost town

where once my career did blossom?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<p>
Who will speak my name

when I am gone?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
Who will sing lamentations

for he who once talked soup?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<p>
- [groans]

- What legacy of ruin am I left with?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
What rewards have I reaped

for the damage done?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
I'd like the chef to hold the pan up

and whisper his or her dreams into it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
Just coffee.

Don't need to talk to it at all. Thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<p>
You look different. Older. A lot older.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<p>
I'm not saying you look bad,

just much, much, much older.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
Thank you, Jill.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
You haven't heard from Cuddlywhiskers

recently, have you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<p>
Cuddlywhiskers? I haven't talked

to him since the show was canceled.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
I worry about him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
About six months back, he disappeared,

stopped returning my calls.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<p>
I'm sure he's fine.

I mean, who returns calls?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
Promise me you'll check on him

when you get back to L.A.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<p>
Maybe swing by his house?

I think you owe him that much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<p>
Fine. Listen, about the play...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
<i>The Tragedy of Greg KingLear,</i>

a theatrical immersion by Jill Pill?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
- Right.

- That's dead. Over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<p>
A thing that happened

that happens no longer,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<p>
- like a whimper in the wind.

- Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
Theater is by its very nature ephemeral.

We shout into the void, "Hey, you!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
And the void says,

"Stop shouting at me, please!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<p>
And we grab the void and we spit

in its face, "Sir, I will not."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<p>
Boy, did New York do a number on you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
Let me tell you about my next piece.

It starts with you,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
BoJack Horseman,

completely naked and covered in milk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
- I'll stop you there.

- It's a symbol for rebirth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<p>
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
I'm still recovering

from being birthed the first time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<p>
Jill, I'm not the guy who does things

that are challenging,

or edgy, or covered in milk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<p>
I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.

I'm thinking about my legacy now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
I want to do things that connect

with people, things that last.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
That's the whole point, nothing lasts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
No, I know, but see, years after I die,

people will still be able

to see me in <i>Secretariat.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<p>
- And then what?

- And then...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<p>
I'll be remembered.

If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
- And then what?

- Then my life will have meaning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
- I don't know!

- Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:27" />

<p>
You know what the real tragedy

of <i>Greg KingLear </i>is?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<p>
Two hours long without an intermission?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<p>
It's that he's a marionette.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<p>
And he doesn't even know someone else

is pulling his strings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<p>
Mmm, I don't think the chef

whispered his dreams into this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
This does not taste like dreams.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
You told me I would be getting

more attention at a smaller agency,

but if anything, I'm getting less.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<p>
Is this the best time to be on your phone?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<p>
I'm sorry.

Let me just send this one email...

<p>

<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<p>
That was a reference to my work,

with which you are clearly not familiar.

<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>

<p>
- Give my regards to the czar.

<p>
Oh, I don't know why

I thought I could do this.

<p>
I'm drowning, and cats hate drowning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<p>
I believe I can take on

more responsibility around here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<p>
- On a provisional basis, of course.

- Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<p>
But we're a small agency

and we need to think like one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
Instead of spreading ourselves thinner,

we should focus on better gigs

for the clients we already have.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
- Oh. Like <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

<i>- </i>Yes.

got him a massive payday

for being in <i>Jerry Maguire.</i>

<p>
[chuckling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<p>
[Heather] You like that, little horsie?

[BoJack] Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>
- But I don't need you to talk.

- [Heather] I'm a mermaid, baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<p>
- Gonna climb up onto your boat.

- [BoJack] What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<p>
- [Heather] What happened?

- Sorry, I just... Give me a minute.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<p>
[Heather] You want me to touch it,

blow on it, sing it happy birthday?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<p>
[BoJack]

No, no, just...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
Why did you say

that thing about the boat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<p>
I don't know, I was being sexy.

You okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
Just forget it. You ruined it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<p>
[exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<p>
You want to talk about it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<p>
There's nothing to talk about.

It was a misunderstanding, that's all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<p>
She just walked in

at the worst possible...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
It-- It wasn't my fault, uh, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<p>
I don't know what you're talking about.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<p>
On the boat, there was a girl.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<p>
- What?

- In New Mexico.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
And she trusted me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<p>
I keep asking myself

if her mother didn't walk in,

would I have done it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<p>
And part of me is sure

that I-- I couldn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
But another part knows that's a lie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<p>
How do you make something right

when you've made it so wrong

you can never go back?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<p>
I just think

you have to keep moving forward?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<p>
[sighs] Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<p>
All my life that's all I've ever done.

What's it gotten me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<p>
Well, hey, look,

you're the star of a movie now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
You're probably gonna win an Oscar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
I'm not even in it. That's not me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<p>
- What do you mean, that's not you?

- I was digitally replaced.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
Special effects. None of it's me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
Wow, that's... [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
That's quite a story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
I shouldn't even be here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
It's been a long night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<p>
Why don't we go to bed?

In the morning, everything will be okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<p>
[lamp clicks]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<p>
- [traffic outside, faint]

- [snorts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<p>
[moans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<p>
Oh, shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<p>
[cell phone vibrating]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<p>
BoJack?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
It's 4:00 am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
No, it's 7:00. I'm in New York.

I'm calling from the future.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<p>
[drowsily] Is that BoJack Horseman?

What is this, a crossover episode?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<p>
What do you want?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<p>
Let's say, hypothetically,

you had some information about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<p>
You were gonna write about it,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
<i>I wanted to stop you</i>

<i>before you could get it published.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<p>
What would be a smart thing

I could do in that situation

that would change your mind?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
Are we fighting about the book again?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<p>
I don't remember

where we left off last time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<p>
No. Diane, not everything is about you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<p>
<i>For once, I have a problem,</i>

<i>I need your help.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
Okay, walk me through it again?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
I don't have time!

It's already three hours later here!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:37" />

<p>
Thanks a lot. Once again,

you've been no help whatsoever.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
Spoiler from the future, you suck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<p>
<i>Sorry, you don't suck. I'm just...</i>

<i>very stressed out right now. Bye.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
Oh, come on, come on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
I'm aware of the situation

and I'm handling it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
- But I haven't even--

- I'm handling it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<p>
I'll see you at the screening tonight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
- But...

- Don't be late.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<p>
- BoJack!

- Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
There you are. Stay right there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
You will not <i>believe </i>the night I had.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<p>
- This city will eat you alive.

- Did you get the ice?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
I'll be right back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
I'm lost again!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
[Peanutbutter]

<i>All right, Oxnard.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<p>
We are looking at

a once in a lifetime opportunity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
Too bad Todd's not here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
He's always the best

at coming up with ideas

that at first might seem terrible...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<p>
Right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<p>
If he was here,

he'd probably say something like,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
"Hey, you know what's cool?

Spaghetti strainers!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
Go on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
And you'd say, "I feel like

I've seen that somewhere before."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
Hah! That is so me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
And then he'd say, "What if I told you

that this spaghetti strainer

is also a hat?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<p>
That is a brilliant idea!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<p>
That's a terrible idea.

That's my point!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
Put that in the maybe pile.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<p>
Right now, we need to focus

on TV shows.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
I'm sure Todd would suggest,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
<i>A Spaghetti Strainer</i>

<i>That's Also A Hat: The TV Show.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<p>
That's it! Todd, you've done it again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
No! Nobody's done anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:09" />

<p>
Oxnard, I want you to buy out

the entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<p>
I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<p>
I'm putting all my money

in spaghetti strainers for this show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<p>
- How is this a show?

- Don't ask me. It's your idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
- [vehicle stopping]

- [door opens, closes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
I took care of our problem.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<p>
What did you do?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<p>
You don't need to know anything else.

It's been taken care of.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<p>
Ana...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
There-- There was a moment

back at the hotel where...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<p>
I really thought I blew it,

I was scared it was all over, and--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<p>
And then after, I was relieved.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
I don't know if I should win an Oscar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<p>
- I don't know if I want to.

- Stop punishing yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
I was in New Mexico.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<p>
None of that matters.

All that matters now is the story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<p>
We get to decide what our story is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<p>
Nobody else gets to tell you

what your story is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
- What is my story?

- I'll tell you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<p>
This has been your dream for the last

30 years. You made it happen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:09" />

<p>
An Oscar won't make you happy forever,

it won't solve all your problems.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
You win that Oscar,

the next day you go back to being you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<p>
But that night is a really good night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
I think you deserve a really good night,

and I know how to get you there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
Do you want that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
Yes, I do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
Go introduce your movie. Tell your story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:33" />

<p>
Tomorrow we fly to Chicago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<p>
<i>Being Secretariat</i>

<i>isn't just about running fast.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<p>
<i>Secretariat's a state of mind.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
<i>It's about doing the right thing,</i>

<i>standing up for yourself.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
<i>Why, I look around and I see</i>

<i>a whole room full of Secretariats.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />

<p>
<i>You are Secretariat.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<p>
<i>And you are Secretariat.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<p>
<i>And you... are Secretariat.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<p>
BoJack, it's such a beautiful movie

and I think such a textured performance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<p>
When you were on <i>Horsin' Around</i>,

could you ever have imagined

that you'd give a performance like this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<p>
- Yes. Actually, I imagined it a lot.

- [laughter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<p>
I always knew I was more

than just a dumb TV actor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
Even if other people

didn't always know that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<p>
- [laughter]

- Seriously, though...

that TV show...

it wasn't me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:29" />

<p>
This movie is me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<p>
And I can't tell you how great it feels

to finally be doing

the kind of work that I can be proud of.

</p>
