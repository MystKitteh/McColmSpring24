<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<line>
So I send in the form,

and if my mom wants to meet me too,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
-then we meet?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<line>
And if she doesn't want to meet me,

then I get to feel that hot sting

of rejection all over again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
What a fun adventure this all is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<line>
You know what <i>is </i>fun? You coming with me

to my first day on my new show.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<line>
"BoJack Horseman

in <i>F.H.B.A. Los Angeles,</i>

starring BoJack Horseman

as 'the Judge.'"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<line>
What is <i>F.H.B.A.</i>?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<line>
I think it's one of those shows

about Navy sex crimes that have gone cold?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<line>
And there may be numbers or something?

Then, they call "the Judge."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<line>
I'm just excited to get out of the house.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<line>
I've been getting really fidgety

cooped up on that hill.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<line>
Like I got tiny little bumps

crawling around

on the inside of my skin, you know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
Totally. Look at this guy,

texting in the middle of the intersection.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<line>
You have been judged

to be a shitty driver.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<line>
I'm the Judge.

I sentence you to kiss my ass.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<line>
Boom!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
You got "judged."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<line>
It feels good

to be a dramatic actor again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
To make someone laugh

is a craft, to be sure,

but to make someone cry, on purpose,

that is a precious gift.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<line>
Hey, I'm Miles, the production intern.

Can I get you anything? Water?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:14" />

<line>
That's so sweet of you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<line>
Actually, that's so his job of him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:17" />

<line>
-Hey, PA, whose name I already forgot.

-It's Miles, and I'm an intern.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<line>
Still not interested. Can you take

my daughter to "video village"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<line>
I wanna make sure she sees me

at my most awesome,

which is with a slightly high angle

to avoid appearance of a double chin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<line>
Note to director.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<line>
-Right this way.

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:31" />

<line>

-[assistant director] Quiet!

BoJack, do you have anything

you'd like to say to the contestants

<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<line>
No, I'm good.

Very well.

<line>
<i>Felicity Huffman's</i>

<i>Future Leaders of America,</i>

but it got retooled a little

by the network.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<line>
So are we judging who has the best booty?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
{\an8}Whoa, BoJack, no.

That is so degrading.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<line>
{\an8}So if it's not about their butts,

then why is the other judge Sir Mix-A-Lot?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
{\an8}Because I'm an honest and impartial judge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<line>
And if there's one thing I'm famous for,

it's that I cannot lie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
Yeah, I guess that would be the one thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

Hey, can we go home now?

{\an8}Being around all these skinny L.A. ladies

makes me feel like a blob.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<line>
{\an8}Well, I gotta shoot

for, like, ten more hours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<line>
Are you serious?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
Apparently, it takes three hours to set up

the "badonka-donka-dobstacle course."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<line>
{\an8}So making TV is like a full-time job?

Then why is it so bad?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
I just assumed people weren't trying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<line>
{\an8}Uh, I don't mean to butt in here,

but shouldn't your daughter be in school?

<line>
{\an8}Shouldn't you be

"Sir Minding-Your-Own-Business-A-Lot"?

<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
I graduated early and took a gap year.

<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
My friend Maryssa is backpacking

through Europe,

but lucky me, I get to hang out

in this butt-infested warehouse.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<line>
Oh. All right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<line>
Someone better be checking

the pH levels of that Jacuzzi

because these bitches are basic.

<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
Hey, you wanna explore the back lot?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<line>
They got a whole area that was built

to look like downtown Toronto.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
That's where they shoot the stuff

set in New York.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
Are you allowed to just leave the set?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<line>
What are they gonna do? Dock my pay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<line>
I'm an intern. They don't pay me.

I got all the power!

<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<line>
{\an8}Princess Carolyn,

you are going to love Stilton Acres.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<line>
{\an8}We have a sauna and a tennis court

and a giant hedge maze.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<line>
{\an8}And if you make it all the way through

the maze, you get some sugar water.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<line>
And you're gonna love

the Feast of Saint Squeaky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
It's the holiest of all mouse holidays.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<line>
We prepare a feast of Swiss--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<line>
Because it's the holiest of all cheeses?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<line>
Because it was all our ancestors

could carry

when they were trying to escape

for their lives.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh-- because it has <i>holes!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<line>
{\an8}-That's very funny.

-Thanks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
{\an8}I really want you and my parents

to get along.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<line>
{\an8}They can be kind of a lot,

especially around the holidays.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm sure I'm going to love them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<line>
{\an8}And they're gonna love me.

I'm Princess Carolyn!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<line>
I'm sure they will too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
But let's wait

until after they love you

to tell them about, you know, Philbert.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<line>
{\an8}Of course. But what about her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
{\an8}Don't worry. She's on her phone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

<line>
{\an8}Unless Ralph and Princess Carolyn's

secret baby starts to trend,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<line>
{\an8}she won't notice anything we do or say.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
-Stefani? Stefani?

-Whoa.

<line>
<i>-How's hotel life?</i>

-Marvelous!

handy list of cable channels.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
Now I know why so many people

like being homeless.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
-Mr. Peanutbutter, that's not--

-On the phone, darling.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<line>
Well, I just found you

the perfect new campaign headquarters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<line>
I'm gonna sign the lease now,

unless you think of a reason

I shouldn't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<line>
Nothing comes to mind.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<line>
Great! It's done.

Now, what did you wanna talk to me about?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<line>
-I'm dropping out of the race.

-What?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<line>
Woodchuck's a better leader

than I'll ever be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<line>
This election is about bigger things

than just you and Woodchuck.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
What is it about then?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<line>
It's about hope, and freedom,

and powerful lobbyists

who pay me to elect

a governor I can control

so we can get legislation passed

that allows them to build private prisons

on what are now protected wetlands.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<line>
Well, hopefully those evil lobbyists

can find some other puppet

to do their bidding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<line>
Why would you hope that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<line>
I'm done running for governor,

so you're fired.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<line>
No hard feelings, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<line>
You idiot. I will end you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
-Bye, Cruella!

-[Katrina screams]

<line>
-[mother] Hello.

-[father] Stefani!

</line>

<line>
-Hello.

-Oh, darling, you're home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<line>
-Nice to meet you.

-Princess Carolyn!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
-Hello.

-I'm Poppy! This is my wife, Mimi.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<line>
And this is our son, Sissy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<line>
And this is my wife, Missy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
And the boys,

Tweeds, Nantucket, and Loophole!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<line>
Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
It's so wonderful to meet you all!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<line>
-Can I get you a cocktail?

-Oh. No, thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<line>
-Wine?

-That's all right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
I will consider it a personal affront

if you won't at least have a beer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<line>
-I shouldn't.

-What about a very caffeinated coffee?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
-No.

-Raw shellfish?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<line>
-Not tonight.

-Cigarette?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<line>
-I don't smoke.

-That's okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
You can just stand around me

while I smoke.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<line>
No, I don't want to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<line>
Cocaine, then?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:32" />

<line>
I so appreciate that,

and I hate to be rude,

but I really don't think it's a good idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<line>
Would you like me to punch you

in the belly real quick

so you remember

what it's like to be alive?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
That's a rich person thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<line>
Oh, I know.

I grew up around rich people.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
But I'm actually good,

as far as belly-punchings go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
Well, can I at least offer you a ride

on our private rollercoaster?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<line>
Surely, there's no reason

you wouldn't want to do that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<line>
-So if you decline, I will be offended.

-Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<line>
Also, not that it's relevant,

but the rollercoaster

is specifically discouraged

for children under five

and pregnant women.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<line>
But since you are neither of those,

obviously, there's no reason

you will not want to ride

on our family's really fun rollercoaster.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<line>
-Okay, look, the truth is--

-Hey, Dad!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<line>
Why don't you tell Princess Carolyn

one of your great golf stories?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<line>
-Say, there's an idea.

-Yes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
So here I am with a mashie

when what I need is a niblick.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<line>
[all laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
Wow, golf. Fore! Am I right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<line>
Yes, that's exactly right. Golf.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<line>
[camera shutters clicking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<line>
Californians, this is an endorsement!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<line>
My message is simple.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<line>
If you want to vote Peanutbutter,

vote Coodchuck-Berkowitz

because a vote for Coodchuck-Berkowitz

is a vote for Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<line>
Uh--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<line>
Since Peanutbutter

likes Coodchuck-Berkowitz.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<line>
So if you like Coodchuck-Berkowitz,

vote like Mr. Peanutbutter...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<line>
-Excuse me--

-...for Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<line>
So if we want to vote for Woodchuck,

we should vote for you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<line>
-No.

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
-By voting for Woodchuck.

-Thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<line>
I look forward to moving past

the political divisiveness

of this campaign

and <i>finally </i>focusing on the issues.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<line>
What's with the gorilla feet?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<line>
As I've explained before,

my hands were crushed

during the fracking incident.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
There were no hand transplants

readily available,

but gorilla feet are somewhat hand-like.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<line>
So I am using them temporarily

while my doctors

find me more suitable replacements.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<line>
[laughs]

They sure made a monkey out of you, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<line>
-[reporters laugh]

-They did no such thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<line>
Gorillas are apes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<line>
I feel that went pretty well.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<line>
Yes, well, thank you

for dropping out of the race.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<line>
Rest assured, under my stewardship,

the state will be in good--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
-You were gonna say "hands," weren't you?

-Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<line>
So, what's next for us two amigos?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

we don't need your help on the campaign.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<line>
We are running virtually unopposed.

I think our team can handle it from here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
Wha-wha-wha-what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<line>
The best way you can help us

is to go back to your regular life

and stay out of politics forever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<line>
So this chapter of my life is over?

Doggy, doggy. What now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<line>
Coochy-coochy-coochy...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<line>
Hey, Mom.

You got something in the mail.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<line>
Have I received

any gentleman callers today?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<line>
I'm expecting a visit

from Corbin Creamerman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<line>
You know what? I'll check.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
You could learn a thing or two

from him, Henrietta!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<line>
Mm-hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<line>
-Hey, where have you been?

-I'll make coffee.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>
Oh, uh...

well, Miles actually took me

to check out UCLA.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<line>
He took me to a party,

and I got to sleep in a dorm room, and...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:20" />

<line>
Wow, look at the time.

That's enough questioning of me,

and where I've been,

and what I've been doing. See ya later!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<line>
Hold up.

Did you and that PA hook up last night?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<line>
BoJack! We didn't just hook up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<line>
Miles is a really interesting soul,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<line>
-and I feel like we connected.

-Oh, boy. Okay. Sit down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<line>
Hollyhock, you are never gonna hear

from that guy again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<line>
Okay, actually, I am,

because when I left his dorm

he said he would,

and I quote, "Definitely text me."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<line>
Oh, wow, I didn't realize.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<line>
Should we plan the wedding for you

and teenage-boy-you-slept-with

who-said-he-would-definitely-text-you"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
Very funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<line>
Believe me, I take no pleasure

in telling you this,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<line>
-but that kid is never, ever, ever--

-[phone chimes]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<line>
-Ooh! BoJack--

-Hollyhock, it is very rude to interrupt.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<line>
Now, where was I?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<line>
Right. You'll never <i>ever</i>

hear from this guy again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<line>
-But, I--

-Ba-ba-ba!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<line>
In fact, if he texts you,

I will do a hundred pushups.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<line>
That's how sure I am,

since there is no possible way--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
"Had a great time last night. Kilometers."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<line>
"Kilometers"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<line>
It's an inside joke between me and Miles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
Not inside enough.

I figured it out and it's dumb.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
-[phone chimes]

-He wants to take me to a party tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<line>
-Shouldn't you be doing pushups?

-[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<line>
Nope, can't. Impossible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<line>
Anyone who says

they did a pushup is lying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<line>
-[phone chimes]

-That him canceling? Classic move.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<line>
No, he wants to spend the day together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<line>
Oh. Well, you wanna

have breakfast first?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<line>
I got a box of crullers,

of which one remains.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<line>
Nah, I'm good with this coffee.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<line>
I'll be home for dinner, though. Bye!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
Forty-six, 47...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>

<line>
We have gathered in Todd's new apartment

to discuss the future of PB Livin'.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<line>
You told me this was an intervention

to get Todd to stop coming up

with awful ideas.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<line>
That was a pretense

to get you to show up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<line>
-What?

-It was Todd's idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
What else you got, Todd?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<line>
Well, I got this one thing.

I don't know. It might be pretty dumb.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<line>
-You bite your tongue.

-Yes, bite it all the way off!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
All your ideas are beyond terrible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<line>
Well, in that case, I guess I must have

"terrible" business instincts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<line>
-You do!

-Because I wanna hear it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<line>
They say "the devil's in the details,"

so let's summon the devil!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<line>
Okay, so you know how hard it is

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<line>
-to get your kids to go to the dentist?

-I don't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
But what if dentists

had a friendlier face?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<line>
Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>
What if you could take your kids

to a dentist's office

where all the dentists were clowns?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<line>
-What?!

-Kids love clowns!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<line>
-Do kids love clowns?

-Actually--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<line>
Don't they?

Who else would clowns be for?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<line>
Because adults don't love clowns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<line>
That is true.

Adults find clowns creepy and off-putting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<line>
So kids <i>must </i>love clowns,

because otherwise,

why would there be clowns?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<line>
That is sound logic. Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<line>
I want these clown dentists

laughing maniacally

as they drill into the teeth

of America's children, starting yesterday!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<line>
As someone who <i>does </i>have children,

I have to say,

a lot of kids

are actually <i>terrified </i>of clowns!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:09" />

<line>
Are they? Hm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<line>
That would have been helpful information

before I committed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
But my word is my bond

and I already said yes, didn't I?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<line>
Okay, so do we find dentists

and train them to be clowns,

or do we get clowns

and train them to be dentists?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<line>
Why don't we get clowns and dentists

and they can train each other?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
Oh, somebody call the police department,

because you are <i>on fire!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:29" />

<line>
[groans] Aw, jeez.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<line>
[all chuckling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<line>

<line>
"Well, when life gives you lemons,

make an Arnold Palmer."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<line>
[all laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
It's been so wonderful getting

to know you all these last few days.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<line>
We're so happy to have you.

Now, let the festivities begin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<line>
-Sissy, hand out those cat ears.

-Cat ears?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<line>
-And this is for you.

-I want those.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<line>
See, the feast is about remembering

the ancient tale of a heroic mouse

named Squeaky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:55" />

<line>
And we always start by wearing cat ears

and singing the song of Squeaky's enemy,

the cat tyrant, King Pusspuss.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<line>
Looks like Princess Carolyn

won't need any cat ears to look evil.

<line>
Sorry, it gets a little graphic.

<line>
I really wish you'd told me

your family's holiday was so anti-cat.

</line>

It's just an old story about one bad cat.

It's not about every cat.

-Hello, Hollyhock.

-What are you trying to do?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<line>
I'm trying to keep you out of trouble

with a showman's flair for the dramatic.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
I texted you I was gonna be home late.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<line>
You don't tell me when

you're home late.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

<line>
This is my house.

You need to ask permission.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<line>
-What? You're not my dads.

-I'm just looking out for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:36" />

<line>
You spent four days

with this kid, I'm worried--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<line>
There's nothing to worry about!

We like each other.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<line>
Yeah, now. But come on, Hollyhock.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<line>
[stammers, sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<line>
He's a teenage boy

whose job is to be around hot women

in skimpy outfits all day.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
You think he's gonna want--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:51" />

<line>
No, I just mean that...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<line>
What, you think

I'm not attractive enough for him?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<line>
Well, you're the one

who said you were a blob.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<line>
-Do you think I'm a blob?

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<line>
What kind of person

calls his own daughter a blob?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<line>
-You said "blob."

-I said I "felt" like a blob.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<line>
Do <i>you </i>think I'm a blob?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<line>
I just-- [sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:08" />

<line>
I just think L.A. is a superficial town

and you need to be careful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:12" />

<line>
Well, Miles likes me just the way I am.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<line>
And that's the kind of person

that I want to spend my time with.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<line>
Hollyhock, wait. Wait. Wait!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:20" />

<line>
I get it! It's my weight!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<line>
Yeah... I'm sorry about all that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<line>
Why didn't you tell me they hate cats?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<line>
They don't hate cats.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<line>
Now I get why you didn't want

to tell your family about the baby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<line>
Okay, I was a little nervous.

But they'll come around.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<line>
Besides, what am I supposed to do?

They're my family.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<line>
-And what are me and Philbert?

-[sighs] Oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<line>
Can't believe she's still pissed.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:51" />

<line>
You shouldn't have called her a "blob."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<line>
I'm a blob too! We're both blobs!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<line>
How about just as a general rule,

don't ever call a woman a blob?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<line>
Never! What if I meet a woman

whose name is Barbara Lob?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />

<line>
And I call her "B" for short. "B. Lob."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<line>
Maybe instead of figuring out

the woman blob workaround,

you should just tell Hollyhock

you're sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<line>
I still think Miles is up to something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<line>
Why is it so hard for you to believe

someone could genuinely

like your daughter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<line>
Because she's like me!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:17" />

<line>
Okay. Do you think maybe this could be

more about <i>you </i>than it is about her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<line>
Yes, obviously, I have a lot of work

to do on myself. Everyone knows that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<line>
But the important thing right now

is how I can fix things with Hollyhock.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<line>
Try to stay on topic, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<line>
Well, an open conversation

about your concerns with--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<line>
No, that's too Diane-y.

She'd never buy it was coming from me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:35" />

<line>
Then why do you want my advice?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<line>
I got it. If I can somehow prove to her

what a jerk Miles is,

then she'll have to like me more

by default.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<line>
That's the BoJack way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:43" />

<line>
BoJack, no--!

Oh-- oh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<line>
Ooh, that's... that's nice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<line>
Goldie, how would you like

to advance to the final round?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<line>
I would do anything, and I mean, anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<line>
-So I did it. I had sex with the PA.

-You had sex with him?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<line>
That's what you wanted, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
I just said "seduce" the PA.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<line>
Doesn't that mean have sex with him?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<line>
No, I just wanted you to,

like, get him all hot and bothered.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<line>
-Eh...?

-And <i>ready </i>to sleep with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:10" />

<line>
Then once you get him on audiotape

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<line>
-saying that he would sleep with you...

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<line>
...come up with some excuse to get

out of there with virtue intact.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:16" />

<line>
That's a lot of specifics

you just assumed I would know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
Okay, well, the important thing is,

we got him now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<line>
Tell Miles what you told me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<line>
-I had sex with the PA.

-What PA?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<line>
I think his name was "Eggberg"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<line>
-What? Not him?

-That's the intern.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<line>
-You said "PA."

-Did you think I was a PA? Nice!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<line>
Why'd you want her to sleep with me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<line>
Not sleep with.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<line>
You told a contestant

you would advance her to the final round

if she slept with a PA?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:44" />

<line>
I said "seduce." There is a distinction.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
We make a show about empowering women

and lifting them up,

and you cheapen it

with this coarse vulgarity.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<line>
I cannot lie. You disgust me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<line>
This was all a big misunderstanding.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<line>
Cover up your bottom and go, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<line>
You're not fit to judge

anyone's character, or their booties.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
So it <i>is </i>about judging booties.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<line>
-Hey, BoJack.

-Miles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<line>
Don't want me dating your daughter,

you could have told me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<line>
I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<line>
Maybe we could've worked out

some sort of deal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<line>
What do you mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
All right, so I got this screenplay,

and I think it's a really fresh area.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<line>
It's about a production intern

who wants to be a writer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<line>
Oh, wow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<line>
I think it could go somewhere

if it got in front of the right person.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<line>
So if you have like an agent

or a manager you could give it to,

that would be awesome,

and I would never talk to Hollyhock again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<line>
I promise.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<line>
So you were right. He <i>was </i>a dirtbag.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<line>
Yeah. I was kinda hoping

I was wrong for once.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<line>
If it makes you feel any better,

you were wrong

about all the other parts of this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<line>
Diane, you are so bad

at making people feel better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<line>
Are you gonna tell Hollyhock?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
She's a smart girl.

She'll figure it out eventually.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
But for now, if she believes someone

can love her for who she really is,

then why would I take that

away from her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<line>
BoJack, you gotta get

one of these massages.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<line>
-Oh-hh!

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<line>
-[Mimi] Goodbye, darling.

-[Sissy] It was good seeing you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<line>
-It was so much fun seeing you both.

-Thank you for hosting us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<line>
It was so nice to get away for the week

and learn all about

your charming little traditions

that didn't freak me out at all. Bye-bye!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<line>
Did our little city mouse

have a nice time in the country?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<line>
Everything was wonderful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
And your little companion was darling--

for a week.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<line>
But I do hope the next one you bring home

knows how to appreciate

a good Feast of Saint Squeaky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<line>
Well, for your information,

there's not gonna <i>be </i>a "next one,"

because...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<line>
I love Princess Carolyn and we're having

a baby and I couldn't be happier!

<line>
Oh, Mr. Peanutbutter, I am so relaxed.

<line>
I didn't realize

how much tension I'd built up in my--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<line>
Oh, my God! Um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, why is our hotel room

filled with dentist clowns?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<line>
Don't be ridiculous, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<line>
They're not all dentist clowns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
Half of them are clown dentists.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
Just try to ignore them

and go about your business.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
-Okay.

-So, this is the incisor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<line>
Doc, if this is what's incisor,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<line>
I'd hate to see what's outsides 'er.

Hyuk, hyuk, hyuk!
