<title>Still Broken - BoJack Horseman</title>

<article>
  
<timestamp data-time="00:00:08" />

<p>
I'm sorry

I broke your expensive bachelor vase.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<p>
[audience] Aww.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<p>
That's all right. I've learned

that when you're in a loving family

there's nothing wrong

with a little horsin' around.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
[laughter, applause]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
[Herb] Cut!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<p>
That's the show, folks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<p>
Now, let's hear it for our amazing cast.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:25" />

<p>
Joelle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
Bradley.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
Little Sarah Lynn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
And our star, BoJack Horseman!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<p>
Thanks for coming out.

Thank you very much.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
-[laughing]

-Wow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<p>
Great pilot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
We got the biggest laugh I ever heard

with that "gag me with a spoon" joke.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<p>
And then we topped it

with the "get a room" joke.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
This was so fun.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
Do we get to make more?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
I think we got a real shot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<p>
And as long as the ratings don't dip

below a dismal 15 million a night,

we could be on the air for many years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:56" />

<p>
-No way!

-All right!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<p>
-Your Squirt, sir.

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
And if that happens,

take care of each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
No matter what,

we're going to stick together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<p>
[unintelligible groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
{\an8}[♪♪]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:12" />

<p>
{\an8}[unintelligible groans continue]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:16" />

<p>
{\an8}Thank you, Tina,

for those touching grunts and growls.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:19" />

<p>
{\an8}I'm Henry Winkler.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<p>
{\an8}You probably remember me

from my 2002 guest role

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:24" />

<p>
{\an8}on <i>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:26" />

<p>
{\an8}-Whoo!

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:27" />

<p>
{\an8}But perhaps the greatest role

I've ever played is friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:31" />

<p>
Herb was a dear friend

and I am honored to be dedicating

this bench in his memory.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:39" />

<p>
In his last days, Herb's cancer

had gone into remission.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:42" />

<p>
He was full of hope.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:44" />

<p>
But on the drive home from the hospital,

his brakes gave out,

he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:49" />

<p>
He survived the crash,

but he was allergic to peanuts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:53" />

<p>
{\an8}He died instantly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<p>
{\an8}Let us now read his final tweets.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<p>
"I'm gonna live forever!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:59" />

<p>
{\an8}Hashtag 'cancer free.'

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<p>
{\an8}Hashtag 'invincible.'

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<p>
Hashtag 'tweeting while driving.'

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:05" />

<p>
{\an8}Oh, no, I think I'm gonna hit that truck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:08" />

<p>
{\an8}Hashtag 'hopefully it isn't full

of peanuts.'

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<p>
{\an8}Hashtag 'Oh, no. It was full of peanuts.'"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
I was wondering

where you wandered off to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
-Oh, shit. Hey.

-Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
I'm no good with funerals.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<p>
{\an8}When I cry, it messes up my makeup

and then I get really bummed out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<p>
{\an8}Yeah, same for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<p>
{\an8}Herb told me you came

by the house last summer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<p>
Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<p>
Did he tell you anything else?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<p>
{\an8}No, we talked about cancer,

how hard it is living with cancer,

about the L.A. Kings,

and then back to cancer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
-Probably--

-Then I read that chapter in your book

about how he never forgave you

and he tried to kick you out of the house

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
{\an8}and you ended up wrestling on the floor

over a telescope.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
{\an8}-Oh, you did read that part?

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:48" />

<p>
{\an8}I just wish

there was something I could do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
{\an8}Okay, I gotta go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
{\an8}Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
You wanna go grab a cup of vodka?

I-- I'm sorry, the funeral.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
I mean, a bottle of vodka?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
{\an8}No. You should stick around.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
{\an8}Hey, maybe you'll find

that something you're looking for.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
{\an8}But if you're ever in New Mexico,

drop me a line.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
{\an8}New Mexico?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:08" />

<p>
{\an8}I thought you lived in Maine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<p>
{\an8}I always pictured you there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
{\an8}A little house by a lake?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<p>
I was just there for, like, a month,

30 years ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<p>
-I live outside Santa Fe now.

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
-[sighs] Think everyone here read my book?

-I didn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
Of course you didn't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
Here's the CliffsNotes version:

Shut up, Todd!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<p>
I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunk

of your car for the next few hours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:39" />

<p>
Have fun being sad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<p>
Do you know what you're supposed to do

with our date pits?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<p>
Why serve dates

and not have a place to put the pits?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
You know,

some people just have no class.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<p>
What are you doing here?

You didn't know Herb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<p>
No, but I do know a hot ticket,

and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:54" />

<p>
Henry Winkler,

Jake and Maggot Gyllenhaal,

that Pakistani girl

who keeps winning Nobel Prizes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<p>
There's so much to hate

about what you just said.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
Good news. You know when someone dies,

everyone wants to buy their shit?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<p>
You're lucky you have a piece

of <i>Horsin' Around,</i>

because this is where money

starts rolling in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<p>
I don't want that. That's blood money.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<p>
Well, what do you want me to do with it?

It's coming.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
I don't know. Give it to some orphans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<p>
-I can't deal with this.

-Oh, come on!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<p>
You don't think Elton John

was raking it in when Diana died?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:22" />

<p>
More like "Candle in the Windfall."

Cha-ching! Hmm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
[Herb] <i>You have to live with the shitty</i>

<i>thing you did for the rest of your life.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<p>
Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:35" />

<p>
[British accent] Hello, love.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
Hey, Joelle,

I actually came here to be alone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<p>
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:41" />

<p>
I just flew in across the pond

and I don't know which end is up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
This might be a stupid question,

but were you always so... British?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
Oh, let's get some light in here,

it's so dreadfully dreary.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<p>
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sure

you used to be American.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
That's better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<p>
Hey, this one's having a freak-out.

She needs to lie down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
I'm not freaking out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<p>
I just don't understand

why that lady was being all judgy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<p>
You were touching her face

and telling her she was gonna die next.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
I'm eccentric. I do weird shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
How is that my problem?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
Hey, when was the last time

all four of us were in the same room?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
Probably not since the show ended.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<p>
Yeah, I left California

pretty much right after.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<p>
Now I got the biggest hardware store

in Seattle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<p>
That's a lie. We're actually in Olympia.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
And I'm on the West End

playing Juliet's... nurse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<p>
-And how are your kids?

-I don't have any kids.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
Oh, I just assumed

you had a bunch of kids,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<p>
'cause, you know, your body.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
Come on, Sarah Lynn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
I assumed

you weren't still a massive cunt.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
-Jesus Christ, Joelle.

-That's an okay thing to say in England.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
Shove it up your ass

with a spoonful of sugar,

you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
-Guys, hey, hey, come on.

-Let go of me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<p>
-I'm gonna hulk out!

-Guys, can we just be civil for one day?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<p>
-Oh, you're one to talk.

-What's that mean?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
Were you being civil

when you had sex with my mom?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<p>
What? I never-- Why would--? Wait, which

one was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<p>
-No.

-This sucks. You guys suck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
I don't even know

why I came to this party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<p>
Herb died?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<p>
You know, maybe it's for the best

we don't get together that often.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<p>
We'd most likely drive each other mad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
Well, no one knows how to get

under your skin like family.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<p>
We're not a family, BoJack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
We probably won't even see each other

again, until the next funeral.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<p>
-Why are you all looking at me?

-You are the oldest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<p>
You are a severe alcoholic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<p>
I'm honestly so high right now,

I don't even know where I'm looking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<p>
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories,

and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:36" />

<p>
Pardon me. Is one of you Sarah Lynn?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<p>
I am. Of course. God, are you blind?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:42" />

<p>
Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
Well, forgive me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<p>
I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
Per the instructions of his last will

and testament, I am to give you this disk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
Am I close?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:55" />

<p>
Just take the disk from the guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
It contains directions to Herb's gold.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:00" />

<p>
Herb's gold?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<p>
There were no further details.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:03" />

<p>
He was a peculiar client.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<p>
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<p>
I'm just a blind man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
Still, Herb thought me wise

for some reason.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<p>
Perhaps it is my overly formal

manner of speech.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<p>
I bid you good day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<p>
Oh, pardon me. Ow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<p>
Right at shin level.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<p>
What are we supposed to do

with a floppy disk?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<p>
Hmm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:26" />

<p>
So, what's up, kiddo?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<p>
BoJack and my mom

are becoming, like, friends

and they're acting real weird.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<p>
Oof! Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<p>
[rattling overhead]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
Hey, guys, guys, come on!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:36" />

<p>
There's somebody beneath you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
Jeez, all day with the...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<p>
Listen, kiddo, forget about them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<p>
You wanna check out

this cool new game I got?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<p>
You have solitaire? On your computer?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<p>
Wow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
I bet it's still in his old office.

Unless somebody else moved in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<p>
Because it was under tap dancing star

Savion Glover's office. Let's go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
-What? Right now?

-Yeah. Don't you get it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<p>
Herb's giving us a reunion special.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
Remember how he always wanted to do

a treasure hunt episode of <i>Horsin' Around</i>

but the network said it was too edgy?

This is that episode.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:13" />

<p>
-I just don't know.

-Yeah, I don't want to do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
Wait, so you'd rather just stay

at this funeral and be sad,

instead of going on a crazy adventure

to find our dead friend's secret treasure?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
Do you have any idea

how insane you sound?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
Oh, I get it.

You just don't wanna be here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<p>
No, that's not it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<p>
Herb clearly wanted us to do this,

as a family.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
Who cares what he wanted?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<p>
He doesn't, because he's dead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
And we all know he hated your guts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<p>
Yeah. He was my best friend

and he died hating me

and nothing I do is gonna change that,

but Herb left you that disk

because he wanted us to find his gold.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
If we can honor Herb's last wish,

then that's something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<p>
I don't know what, but it's something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<p>
-Okay. For Herb.

-Fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
-Shotgun!

-Everyone knows you can't call shotgun

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<p>
-before you see the car!

-My turn! Get out of my way!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<p>
Brad, hang on one second.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<p>
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:05" />

<p>
-No.

-Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<p>
Hi, Henry Winkler.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:09" />

<p>
I loved you in that one episode

of <i>Law &amp; Order: SVU.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<p>
Oh, thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>
How would you like

to narrate a documentary for--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:16" />

<p>
Hey, listen, I am so flattered,

but today is about Herb,

so let's respect that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:22" />

<p>
Oh, God, I-- I'm so sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<p>
I'll let you get back to your business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<p>
Hey, Winkly, such a shame, isn't it?

About our friend Herb?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
It really burns my brisket

that some people would turn a funeral

into some kind of schmoozefest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<p>
Yeah. I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
Those other people are the worst.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
I bet that woman barely knew Herb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
Anyway, hi, I'm Henry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<p>
I used to volunteer with Herb

at Habitat For Humanity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:48" />

<p>
Or as we like to call it,

Herbitat For Henranity. [laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<p>
We spent most of the day working

on that name,

and only part of the day building,

but still, we helped some people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
-How did you know Herb?

-We also volunteered at a, um...

soup plantation-- Kitchen! Soup kitchen!

Whichever one is the good one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
What? I never knew you did that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn, please elaborate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<p>
Oh, hey, Mr. Peanutbutter, why don't you

talk about how you knew Herb?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
Oh, I never met the guy.

I'm just here to schmooze.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<p>
Tell us about your thing, though,

it sounds fascinating.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
Everyone, gather round and listen

to Princess Carolyn's story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<p>
Wow, Herb kept all this old stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:34" />

<p>
He sure did.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<p>
Look, one of those answering machines

with tapes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
<i>Mr. Kazzaz, this is Manny from Pep Boys.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:42" />

<p>
<i>We fixed the brakes on your car,</i>

<i>pick it up tomorrow.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
<i>Just to reiterate,</i>

<i>your brakes are in great shape</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
<i>and shouldn't give you any more trouble.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<p>
<i>Unless, of course,</i>

<i>someone intentionally cut them,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
<i>but why would anyone do that?</i>

<i>I'm sorry, I'm rambling.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
<i>Probably because I'm such a big fan.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<p>
Horsin' Around<i> was a goddamn riot!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
<i>I especially loved those kids.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
<i>You know, wasn't so crazy</i>

<i>about the horse, though--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
Message deleted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<p>
Mm... How curious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<p>
How could you like <i>Horsin' Around</i>

but not the horse?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<p>
That's like watching <i>Castle</i>

but hating castles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:15" />

<p>
I mean, I've never seen it.

I assume it's about castles.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
-Wow!

-[all yell]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<p>
Look at all these old 20th century relics.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:24" />

<p>
-How did you get here?

-I was in your trunk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
Now I'm in outer space.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
Cut it out with your childish high jinks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<p>
Yeah, get out of here, dweeb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
Whoa, can't I help?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<p>
Here's 10 bucks. There's a Squirt machine

by the garage. Get five cans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<p>
You got it. I won't let you down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<p>
-[clattering, thumping]

-Oh, no!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
Your mom, was her name Karen?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<p>
-Can we drop it?

-Something with a "K"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<p>
Her name is Nora. You know,

my parents got a divorce because of you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<p>
Nora? I don't know.

I banged so many chicks in the '80s.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:55" />

<p>
Okay, Todd, you can do this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

<p>
Five Squirts.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<p>
You just need to take this money

and put it in that machine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
This-- Wait, what?

What happened to the $10?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
[grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<p>
No! Wind! Be cool!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<p>
-Hey! That's mine!

-[screeching]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>
-[screams]

-Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<p>
[screeches]

[thud]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
Why does this always happen to me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
Looks like Herb set up a password.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
Oh, this is easy. Try "BoJack."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
-No. Didn't work.

-"BoJack-BFF"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<p>
"BoJack-I-Forgive-You"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
Well, I'm out of ideas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
Hmm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
I'm just, like, so mad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
Well, you should be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
You're on the show

that fired Herb Kazzaz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:43" />

<p>
What are the writers doing to my baby?

Are they killing it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
Are they putting my baby into a car,

then driving the car into a lake?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<p>
Topical! I still got it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<p>
They keep giving the best story lines

to Sarah Lynn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<p>
I haven't gotten

a single very special episode.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<p>
When am I gonna learn

about drunk driving?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
Don't worry so much.

It's my legacy they're crapping all over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<p>
You're gonna come out

smelling like a daisy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<p>
<i>You're too good for this TV stuff, anyway.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
You're a real actress,

you should be doing theater.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
Hold on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:09" />

<p>
Hey, Joelle.

Wanna go to the mall this weekend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<p>
Don't you have any friends

your own age from school?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<p>
No. My mom's boyfriend home-schools me.

He's a photographer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
I'm going to the Lilith Fair this weekend

to support female solidarity.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>
-So scram!

-Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
Hey, be nicer to Sarah Lynn, will you?

She didn't choose this life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<p>
Remember this word: family.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<p>
Okay? You two are family,

whether you like it or not,

and that's the most important thing.

You listening? What's the most important?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<p>
Family. It's family. I get it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
I've got it! The password is...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<p>
"password."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<p>
It worked!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
Good thinking, Joelle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<p>
So in that memory,

were you British or American?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<p>
The disk just has just one file on it,

it's--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
It's the address of a storage locker

in Van Nuys.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
A storage locker? Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:57" />

<p>
This treasure hunt sucks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<p>
[rattling overhead]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
At long last, can you keep down the noise,

keep down the funk?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<p>
If tap dancing was gonna be a cool thing,

it would have caught on by now!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<p>
And when the mayor gave us the key

to the city,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:16" />

<p>
Herb said, "Volunteering isn't about keys.

It's about people."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<p>
-How touching.

-Good story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<p>
-Who are you again?

-Wow, that was touching.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<p>
A story that could never be topped.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<p>
Or could it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn, sing us another song

in the key of Kazzaz.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
You clearly knew the man so well.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
Please tell us another story

but with even more details.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<p>
Yes. That's a great idea, Mr. Dog-Man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<p>
Tell us another story, Pink Cat Lady.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<p>
Story, story!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<p>
Come on, everybody.

What is this, a funeral?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<p>
[all] Story, story, story!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<p>
Well, you blew it again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<p>
You really are a dweeb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<p>
Don't say that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<p>
Whoa, who are you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<p>
Some kind of magical trash troll?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:02" />

<p>
No. I'm a janitor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
But I was clearing out some

of the old stages,

and I found this transformation chamber.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
Looks like a bunch of old junk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
Let me tell you a story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
Back in the '90s, the biggest dweeb

of them all was Steve Urkel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<p>
Oh, yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:19" />

<p>
It was so funny how he never knew

whether or not he did that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
Right.

Well, nerdy Steve Urkel invented a machine

that transformed him

into the debonair Stefan Urquelle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:30" />

<p>
Mr. Janitor, you're standing next

to a machine right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<p>
Yes. That's why I brought it up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<p>
Now, this is just a prop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<p>
But it represents a very powerful idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:42" />

<p>
So if I go through that magic machine,

I'll become cool and confident?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
No, it's a-- It's a prop. I just said--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
[inhales, exhales deeply]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
-I feel different.

-Now, son--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
Todd? Who's Todd?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
My name's Toad. Toad Chavay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />

<p>
And I gotta get my bubble on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<p>
Machine? Squirt me. Hi-yah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:11" />

<p>
That'll do, machine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<p>
Hmm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:20" />

<p>
Look at all this

<i>Horsin' Around </i>fan correspondence

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<p>
Herb received in the post. Capital!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<p>
Guys.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<p>
[all gasp]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<p>
Someone already got to Herb's gold.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:32" />

<p>
Oh, shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
There's a bunch of fur in here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<p>
It's bear fur.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<p>
I can tell. My stepdad was a bear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
Herb's nurse is a bear.

You think she knew about this gold?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
Hey, listen to this letter.

I think it might be a clue.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<p>
Ahem. "Dear Herb,

just finished reading your novel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<p>
It's phenomenal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
I'm jealous. I wish I wrote it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<p>
Sincerely, Henry Winkler,

the guy from that one episode

of <i>Law &amp; Order: SVU."</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<p>
Herb wrote a novel?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>
Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<p>
You look thin. Did you get into CrossFit?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:06" />

<p>
No, Sarah Lynn, I'm dying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
Whatever it is, it is super slimming.

I am for totes jel over here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<p>
It's rectal cancer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:12" />

<p>
Ew! Some of us are eating.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
Look, the reason I called you

is because I need a favor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
Want me to leak a nude pic for charity?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
I want you to sober up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>
First of all, rude. Second, gross.

And third, why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<p>
I have a very important job for you,

but if you're zonked out all the time,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:29" />

<p>
I'm not sure I can trust you

with the responsibility.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<p>
No! I can do it! I'll get clean tomorrow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<p>
[sniffing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<p>
I said tomorrow, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
I've been working on this novel.

I wanna be remembered for something.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
All I ever did was that stupid sitcom

that got ripped away from me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<p>
But now, with this book,

I have something good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<p>
I'm telling you, this book is gold.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
-It's my Kazzaz-terpiece.

-Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
I want you to make sure

it gets published after I die.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<p>
You can count on me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
To life, huh? It'll kill you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
Oh, my God, the gold is his manuscript.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<p>
Herb made me promise

to get it published after he died.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<p>
And you're just remembering this now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<p>
Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.

The ketamine's wearing off.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<p>
Oh, my God, you were the other kid

on <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
That's why you've been following us

around all day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<p>
So no one's read this book

except for Henry Winkler

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<p>
-and now the book is missing?

-He must have been waiting for Herb to die

so he could steal the book

and publish it himself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
But then when the cancer went

into remission--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:34" />

<p>
Guys, I don't think

that car crash was an accident.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<p>
I think Herb might have been murdered!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
[gasping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:40" />

<p>
[huffing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<p>
What's going on?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
Something about a merger?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<p>
My name's Toad, baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<p>
Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
Coolsville, daddy-o.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<p>
Oh, lookie here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<p>
Yo! That's my bike!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<p>
Oops. Did I do that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<p>
Damn. I know I should be mad,

but that guy's just so cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<p>
And when the river finally stopped,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<p>
Herb went over

to a poor little Ottawan boy

and he said, "Son, you have water now."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<p>
You know, a lot of people go their

whole lives and they never give a damn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<p>
That was beautiful.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<p>
You clearly had a special relationship.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
We were gonna sprinkle Herb

over the ocean,

but his resting place should be

someplace meaningful, don't you think?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<p>
Why don't you take this up to Ottawa

and spread his ashes there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
And make sure you take a video,

and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:53" />

<p>
So we can always remember

your great friendship.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<p>
Everybody, stop!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
Henry Winkler is a stone-cold killer!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
[all gasp]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
What? I'm not a killer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
Unless you mean killer of gloom,

because I bring joy everywhere I go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<p>
Did you mean "killer of gloom

because I bring joy everywhere I go"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:09" />

<p>
You know that's not what I meant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
You murdered Herb

so you could publish his book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
But we're not gonna let you

steal his legacy, Henry Winkler.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
I was afraid this would happen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<p>
-Oh, no, he's got a gun!

-Oh, no!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<p>
No, I have Herb's book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<p>
I didn't kill Herb,

but I did steal his manuscript.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<p>
-So that I could burn it.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

<p>
Because it's terrible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<p>
Well, I'll see for myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
"The air in 1830s California was fragrant

with the flowers of laughter

and the smoke of adventure."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<p>
-What?

-Uh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
After he died, Tina and I agreed

we couldn't let the book get published.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:52" />

<p>
It would have turned Herb

into a laughingstock.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<p>
"The carpenter's boy was a hungry boy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<p>
Hungry for crumpets.

But also hungry, dot, dot, dot, for life."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

<p>
He literally wrote out "dot, dot, dot."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
I know there's no accounting for taste,

but come on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:06" />

<p>
[BoJack sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
He's right. Herb wanted a legacy,

but he already has one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<p>
People loved <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

This would only ruin that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<p>
I'm sorry I accused you of murder,

American TV legend Henry Winkler.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
No need to apologize.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death

to give it meaning.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
But there is no meaning in death.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<p>
That's why it's so terrifying.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
It was just easier to believe

that you killed him for his book

than believe that he just died

for nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<p>
There is no shame in dying for nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
That's why most people die.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<p>
I just wanted to fix things somehow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:42" />

<p>
I'm sorry, Horse Guy, but you can't.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:50" />

<p>
Wow, heady stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
But let's not get distracted

from what a true friend

Princess Carolyn is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<p>
Don't forget the ashes, Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
Fantastic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<p>
Hey. Special delivery.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<p>
Courtesy of the Toad-man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<p>
Thanks. Hey, why'd you roll up

your sleeves like that? You look weird.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<p>
Oh, I-- [coughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
Well, you know, I was--

I was trying out a new look.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
It was-- It was a dumb idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:23" />

<p>
Yup. Whoa! Oh, no! Ow... Ow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<p>
-Here's your Squirt, sir.

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
And if that happens, I want you

to take care of each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<p>
No matter what,

we're going to stick together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<p>
-Congratulations!

-Hey, good job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<p>
-You've got a goddamn hit on your hands.

-Anyone got coke?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<p>
ABC sent us limousines

to take us to the wrap party.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<p>
I'm scared. I've never been in a limo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
Don't worry. We'll take care of you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
-Seriously, no one has coke?

-Let's go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<p>
You don't wanna go to the party?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<p>
Nah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<p>
Hey, we never got a chance

to walk around the lot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<p>
Wanna check out that water tank

where they filmed <i>The Love Boat?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<p>
Are you kidding? I've always wanted

to get tanked in a tank.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<p>
-[laughing]

-Shh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<p>
-Quiet. Be careful.

-Oh, okay, okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:13" />

<p>
You ready?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<p>
-What?

-What--? The water's only two inches deep.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:18" />

<p>
Well, that's Hollywood for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:23" />

<p>
Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<p>
Are you scared at all?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:27" />

<p>
That if the show takes off,

everything's going to change?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<p>
[laughs] No, I'm not scared, BJ.

The future is bright.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:35" />

<p>
Just look at it.
