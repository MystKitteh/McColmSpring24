<line>
<i>Now that's what I call</i>

[audience laughs and applauds]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

Uh... Yeah.

<timestamp data-time="00:01:00" />

<line>
Hiya!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<line>
{\an8}And the animals' choice is...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:04" />

<line>
Hank Hippopopalous,

<i>Hank After Dark!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<line>
[Wolf howls]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:08" />

<line>
Oh, yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
[camera shutters clicking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<line>
No, no, no, no.

It's because we're on a show

called <i>Party of Five. </i>Get it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<line>
Hey, buddy,

pass me that bottle of vodka?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<line>
-That's not really how this works.

-It's open bar, don't be a dick.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<line>
-BoJack Horseman?

-Do I know you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<line>
This is my better half,

Katrina Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:26" />

<line>
-Katrina, BoJack.

-I don't watch TV.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:28" />

<line>
Can I get another drink now or

will that quote, unquote "embarrass" you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<line>
-Uh, uh, no, I would never be--

-Erica! Throw me a raft. I'm dying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<line>
My friends told me to get

a prenup,

but I was like,

"Hey, marriage lasts forever."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:42" />

<line>
Listen, I'm doing my own thing here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:44" />

<line>
Can you believe two guys like us

were even in the same category

as Hank Hippopopalous?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:50" />

<line>
[chuckles] That's Uncle Hanky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:51" />

<line>
Listen, Peanutbottle,

there is no "guys like us."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:54" />

<line>
I'm BoJack Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<line>
You're just some other guy

I'll probably never talk to again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:58" />

<line>
Hey, boys.

What is this, a crossover episode?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<line>
[all laugh]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:03" />

<line>
That is the funniest thing

I have ever heard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<line>
Uncle Hanky.

Sir, I am your biggest fan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:09" />

<line>
I used to watch <i>Hank Hippopopalous's</i>

<i>Dance-Pop Cosmopolis</i>

every day after school.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:14" />

<line>
-Hey, can I get a picture with you?

-Of course, kid.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:17" />

<line>
Here, let me advance this. [grunts]

And we probably got it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:21" />

<line>
And we'll find out

in four to six weeks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:23" />

<line>
Yeah, I can't wait.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:24" />

<line>
Okay, I gotta go.

My wife's hand just disappeared

into that busboy's pants.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:28" />

<line>
Treasure? Sweetheart? We're in public.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:31" />

<line>
Hey, kid, listen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<line>
Don't beat yourself up too bad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:34" />

<line>
I've seen your show. You're really funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />

<line>
-Yeah?

-Yeah. But I'm Uncle Hanky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:40" />

<line>
You can't beat Uncle Hanky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:42" />

<line>
That's just the way it is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:47" />

<line>
This suit needs more flasks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:51" />

<line>
{\an8}[♪♪]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
-Diane!

-[passenger] Aah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
Will you bring me one of those

big Toblerone bars? [chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
Well, sure. But, you know, I won't

be out there for another month.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<line>
Yes, I know, but I always forget to

write these things down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
Tell me, how's your little movie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<line>
{\an8}Actually one of the stars just died.

It's really sad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<line>
Oh, really? One person died? Just one?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>Yeah, well, that's a real tragedy.</i>

<i>Meanwhile, Diane,</i>

here in Cordovia, I'm stitching

children's arms back on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:18" />

<line>
Oh, that's backwards, isn't it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<line>
{\an8}Are you giving me a thumb's up

or a thumb's down? I can't tell.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:24" />

<line>
{\an8}Well, now the production's

on hiatus

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
{\an8}so BoJack and I

are going on a book tour

to promote the new paperback edition

of <i>One Trick Pony.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
Please get here soon, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<line>
The people of Cordovia need you

and I need that Toblerone.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<line>
Okay, listen, you big dummy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<line>
{\an8}You need to be on

your best behavior for this tour.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
{\an8}Don't do that BoJack thing

where you go off-script

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
{\an8}and get a lot of people

mad at you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<line>
{\an8}What? I don't do that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
{\an8}You're a movie star now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:50" />

<line>
{\an8}Any bad press you get

can hurt <i>Secretariat.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<line>
<i>Now boarding, Flight 422 to Juneau.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<line>
Please. We're going to Alaska.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<line>
{\an8}How am I gonna offend a bunch

of inbred Eskimo blubber-munchers?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
{\an8}You're right. What was I thinking?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:04" />

<line>
<i>The Republic of Cordovia's</i>

<i>Prince Gustav</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<line>
<i>visiting Los Angeles this week</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>while his country</i>

<i>rests on the brink of civil war.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>Prince Gustav</i>

<i>is a ruthless despot,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>but I'd still rather share a bed</i>

<i>with him than my ex-wife.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>Shannon, I didn't mean that.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<line>
[dance music playing over speakers]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<line>
Listen. With <i>Hey, I Think You</i>

<i>Can Dance </i>as a lead-in,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
{\an8}we are expecting big things

for <i>Hollywoo Stars and Celebrities:</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<line>
<i>What Do They Know? Do They Know Things?</i>

<i>Let's Find Out,</i>

or <i>H.S.A.C.W.D.T.K.D.T.K.T.L.F.O.</i>

for short.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<line>
-Mm.

-[Wanda] Why don't we get Hank in here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<line>
You guys can get

some pictures together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<line>
Hank is coming here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<line>
That old guy from

<i>Hey, I Think You Can Dance?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<line>
-What's the big deal?

-You don't understand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
When I was a kid,

this guy was <i>the</i> guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
I even bought his novelty rap album,

<i>The Hank Hippopopalous Hip-Hop Hypothesis.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<line>
You shouldn't meet your hero

on an empty stomach.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:56" />

<line>
-Want me to go get you some chili?

-Good call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
Chili is nature's chillaxative.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<line>
Hiya, folks! Howdy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<line>
{\an8}-Hank Hippopopalous.

-Oh, we've met.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
Oh, oh, yeah. I remember that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
Okay, so, I thought for the ad,

you guys could stand back to back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
And then on the billboard it'll say:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<line>
{\an8}"Hank and Mr. Peanutbutter are back

to back. Thursdays on MBN." [laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
{\an8}So, what should I do with my arms?

Like akimbo?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<line>
{\an8}-You're fine.

-Reverse akimbo?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<line>
{\an8}-No, that--

-King Tut? Mashed Potato? Windmill?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<line>
{\an8}Uh-oh, I'm windmilling.

Got a momentum going.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:28" />

<line>
-Can't stop windmilling now.

-Hey, hey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<line>
Why don't we just do

what feels natural?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
Guys like us? We're pros.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<line>
"Guys like us"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<line>
You think I'm a guy like us?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<line>
Oh, this is the happiest moment

of my life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<line>
Excuse me,

would you get a picture of us?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<line>
Yeah, that's kind of the idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:45" />

<line>
Now we open the floor to questions

from the audience.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<line>
BoJack, your book talked a lot about

how much you love apple fritters.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<line>
Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<line>
So, my question is:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<line>
Do you think Israel

has a right to defend herself?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<line>
-Uh...

-And what part should the U.S. play

as an ally?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<line>
{\an8}[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<line>
{\an8}Well, the thing about that...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
{\an8}[both growl]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<line>
{\an8}Uh... It's a shame that Arafat

walked away from the table in 2000.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:11" />

<line>
{\an8}I mean, obviously there's no panacea,

but a two-state solution

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
{\an8}with an emphasis on human rights

feels like a place to begin.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:16" />

<line>
{\an8}[audience murmuring]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<line>
{\an8}-[Moose] Brilliant insight.

-[woman] Very good.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<line>
-My question is for Diane Nyu-- Nyu--

-Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:22" />

<line>
- Nyu--

-You won't get it. Ask the question.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
Your book went to some revealing places.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<line>
Were you worried at all that it

would hurt BoJack or his career?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
That's a great question.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:31" />

<line>
I'd also like to know

the answer to that, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<line>
Well, I think the truth

is worth pursuing, no matter what.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<line>
BoJack's not perfect.

There are other celebrities

who have done much worse things

and it hasn't hurt their careers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<line>
-Like who?

-I don't know, like Mike Tyson

or... Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin,

or Christian Slater, Woody Allen,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<line>
Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
Wait, wait, what about

Hank Hippopopalous?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
Well, all of his former assistants

have made the same allegations.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<line>
-I feel like we're getting off track.

-Do you not know that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<line>
Any questions about me,

the handsome, famous horse with a book?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<line>
What do you have against Uncle Hanky?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<line>
I'm not saying anything

not on the public record.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:08" />

<line>
You can just Google

"Hank Hippopopalous allegations" and I--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<line>
Oh, you don't have to

Google it right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:12" />

<line>
[all gasp]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
Dear God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:15" />

<line>
Stanky Hanky?

Allegations vile and ranky.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<line>
But first, the visiting

Cordovian Prince Gustav

went missing briefly

this afternoon,

but he was quickly found

buying chili in Beverly Hills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:27" />

<line>
His official statement was,

"Uh, yeah, I'm the Prince of Cordovia.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<line>
Hooray, being a prince."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<line>
Our main story,

ominous and anomalous accusations

against Hank Hippopopalous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<line>
Who is this anonymous Diane Nguyen

and what does she have against

our beloved hippopotamus?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<line>
Joining me now is

Hippopopalous apologist

and armchair sociologist,

Cardigan Burke. Cardigan,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<line>
{\an8}what are these allegations?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:49" />

<line>
{\an8}These allegations are so crazy,

I can't even say them on TV

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:52" />

<line>
{\an8}or I'll sound like a crazy person.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
{\an8}What I want to know

is why we're letting a national treasure

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<line>
{\an8}face the same kind of smear tactics

used by the Viet Cong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:00" />

<line>
{\an8}Are you calling attention to the fact

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<line>
{\an8}that Ms. Nguyen is Vietnamese?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
{\an8}I'd like to think that's a coincidence.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
[Peanutbutter] <i>You gotta see</i>

<i>this set they're building!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:11" />

<line>
There's a giant replica of my head,

and every episode, the eyes

light up with dollar signs,

confetti shoots out of the ears,

then I somersault out the mouth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<line>
We're bringing class

back to primetime.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:21" />

<line>
-Sounds amazing.

-And I'm really getting along

with J.D. Salinger.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<line>
-Did you know we both hate phonies?

-I did know that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<line>
So... listen.

Some website called "Tit Puncher"

about Hank Hippopopalous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<line>
Oh, my God, Mr. Peanutbutter,

I didn't mean for that to happen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
Hey, do me a favor.

Please don't make a big thing out of this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
It's really not a good time, you know,

with my show about to launch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
-Hey, we are on the same page.

-Oh, are you also on "Tit Puncher"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<line>
Because you should not read

the comments.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<line>
Believe me,

nothing would make me happier

than for this to just go away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:53" />

<line>
-Great. I love you, too.

-[with heavy accent] Hello.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<line>
-Oh, my God!

-Is chili you ask for.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<line>
I am peasant boy Todd

from village.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<line>
Friend of Peanut Man, and lover

of federated American states.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
No reason for suspicions.

[laughs] Come on!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
Wait a second, something's different.

[sniffs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<line>
I am... digging this new cologne!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<line>
You smell like a fancy cabbage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<line>
Is so great to be

in meager trash city Los Angeles

with no pressures of royal life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<line>
What? Royal life?

Why I'm saying? I am no royal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<line>
[chuckles] Look at me. Normals.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<line>
There's that classic

self-deprecating Todd wit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
I'd know it anywhere.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<line>
-We will now begin our Q and A.

-Fire when ready.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:37" />

<line>
What you got against Uncle Hanky,

you uppity cooze?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
Diane,

I believe this question is for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<line>
If anyone here has any questions

about the book,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<line>
I'd be happy to answer those.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
As would I, BoJack Horseman,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<line>
Golden-Globe winning

star of the book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<line>
If Hank did anything wrong,

they wouldn't let him on TV, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<line>
I'm really not here

to talk about that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<line>
You women are all the same.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
-Excuse me?

-Yeah, you make these

broad accusations

to get attention for yourself,

and when you don't have proof

to back it up, you just slink away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<line>
I'm not slinking away.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<line>
I just wanted to say one thing

about me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
I text and drive like all the time.

What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<line>
Isn't that what happened with all

those assistants? They took his money,

and they don't even care

they could be ruining a man's life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
What? <i>They</i> ruined <i>his</i> life?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<line>
-You should probably just drop this.

-Oh, I'm gonna drop it, all right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
They don't even know

how much I'm gonna drop it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<line>
The way you said that

made it sound like you won't drop it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>
{\an8}How dare you spread

a narrative that--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
{\an8}Don't tell me what to spread.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<line>
{\an8}I'll spread whatever I want.

It's called one of the amendments.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
{\an8}Ladies, please! Don't get hysterical!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<line>
{\an8}-This is completely--

-Yeah, hi.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:39" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm Diane's friend, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
{\an8}I came with her. I gotta say

I'm opposed to child labor,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<line>
{\an8}like as a rule, but there

are some kinds of labor

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<line>
{\an8}that children are just better at.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<line>
{\an8}You ever try to fit

into a mine shaft?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<line>
{\an8}That is a tight squeeze. What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, man, probably gonna get

some letters about that, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm so incorrigible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<line>
{\an8}Everyone's paying attention

to me now!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<line>
{\an8}Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<line>
{\an8}Anyone else want a snack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
{\an8}No? That's a no?

On the snacks? Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<line>
{\an8}What do you have against

Hank Hippopopalous?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
{\an8}Everyone says

he's a really nice guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<line>
{\an8}Good point.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<line>
{\an8}That's exactly the problem.

Because he's so nice,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<line>
{\an8}people don't wanna think

he's capable of awful things

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
{\an8}so they let him off the hook.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<line>
{\an8}We don't know what happened.

It's a classic "he said, she said."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:21" />

<line>
{\an8}"He said, <i>they</i> said."

It's eight different women.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
{\an8}-Are they all lying?

-I mean, probably. We do that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:28" />

<line>
{\an8}At this point,

we just don't know enough to judge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:31" />

<line>
{\an8}Who are these women?

Have they ever shoplifted perhaps?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>
{\an8}Do they wear short shorts?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<line>
{\an8}Do they drink alcohol?

All these things are possible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<line>
{\an8}We don't know the facts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<line>
{\an8}See, this is part of the problem.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<line>
{\an8}You're supposed to be a journalist.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<line>
{\an8}You won't even tell your audience

what he's accused of.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<line>
{\an8}You're an expert.

Why don't you tell us?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<line>
{\an8}I'm not afraid to say it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:47" />

<line>
{\an8}Eight different women,

all former assistants,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
{\an8}claim that Uncle Hanky

took them to a--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<line>
What is Diane doing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
I know. It's supposed to be my book tour

and she's upstaging me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<line>
Like how it was supposed

to be my book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<line>
Actually, this might be

a thing she does.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<line>
She knows that Hippopopalous

is the only thing

keeping my network afloat, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<line>
The same network

that employs her husband.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<line>
Why would she do this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
Sometimes she just whips

herself into a frenzy

and she loses all perspective.

Goddamn it, honeydew?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<line>
Jesus, why does cantaloupe think

every time it gets invited to a party,

it can bring along

its dumb friend honeydew?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<line>
You don't get a plus-one,

cantaloupe!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<line>
You need to talk to her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<line>
Huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<line>
Wanda, I just got back from a set visit

on <i>Contemporary Family.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
It's a disaster!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<line>
-What?

-The kids have gone through puberty.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

on everything.

<line>
-Hey, man.

-Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<line>

through someone else's mail?

</line>

</line>

The pleasure's yours.

Walk with me, squawk with me.

a Kennedy at a wake for another Kennedy,

but damn if she doesn't

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:06" />

<line>
No. Yes. Turtleneck. You're fired.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<line>
Um, okay, I wanted to pitch you

an exposé on Hank Hippopopalous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<line>
I would love

to take down Hippopopalous

and finally topple the acropolis

of monstrous hypocrisy

that ensconces us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<line>
Hey, wouldn't your readers

prefer something more relevant?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<line>
Like, uh, what to do with all those

extra buttons that come with your shirts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<line>
Amanda, I am so glad you're throwing

your weight behind this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<line>
-Oh, I didn't mean--

-That dress is hideous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:31" />

<line>
Go home, burn it and come back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<line>
When we know what we know

about a monster like that

and we still put him on TV

every week,

we're teaching a generation

of young boys and girls

that a man's reputation

is more important

than the lives of the women

he's ruined.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:43" />

<line>
Yes, exactly!

I feel like I've been alone

in a crazy alternate universe

these last few days.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<line>
Well, you know I got your back,

right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
We women have got to stick to--

Hey, fruit plate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<line>
No, people don't want articles

about that. People want life-hacks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<line>
Diane, you need to be strong.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<line>
Everyone is gunning for you. You're

a woman talking out of turn about a man.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<line>
We're not supposed to have opinions.

We're supposed to smile and look pretty.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<line>
No, this model doesn't look as pretty

as the other one. Can we kill it?

</line>

<line>
Scarves, not just for necks anymo--

who's willing to go on the record.

I already reached out to all eight

of Hank's former assistants. Nothing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<line>
-What about his current assistant?

-You think she'd talk?

I didn't do any of those things

I wanna be very clear.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<line>
Toyota-Trader Joe's,

and we agreed

these kind of stories,

they don't sell magazines.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
-Are you seriously killing this?

-It's just not a good time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<line>
So, this has nothing to do

with the fact

that AOL-Time Warner-Pepsico-

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
Viacom-Halliburton-Skynet-Toyota-

Trader Joe's also owns MBN,

and is currently profiting off of

Hank Hippopopalous's good reputation?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<line>
I know you're upset.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<line>
Would you like a Joe-Joe?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<line>
It's just like an Oreo,

but Trader Joe's style.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<line>
No, I don't want a Joe-Joe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<line>
Because you're mad at me, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<line>
Not because Joe-Joes

taste like garbage?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<line>
So, help me to understand...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<line>
Dog friend's program

is to find what celebrities know?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<line>
{\an8}-Yep.

-So, is torture?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<line>
{\an8}We don't torture people

in America, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<line>
{\an8}That's called

one of the amendments.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<line>
{\an8}No, of course.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<line>
{\an8}In America,

you do not know to suffer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<line>

you drink your ade of gator.

</line>

<line>

but no way for live.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<line>
I go now. Back to palace!

<line>
[shouting in Cordovian]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
Sounds great, Todd.

See you tomorrow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
So, they hated the skorts idea, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<line>
No, I didn't pitch your skorts idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<line>
[man 1] Hey, Diane!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<line>
Why don't you shut

your stupid ugly face?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<line>
Don't you talk to her like that!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<line>
[man 2]

Yeah, don't listen to that guy, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<line>
I say you should

shut your stupid pretty face.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<line>
-This is not over. When people hear what--

-Give it a rest. It's over. You lost.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<line>
-How could you say that?

-What are you doing here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<line>
I mean, what is your endgame

in all of this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<line>
You don't actually believe

Hank's innocent, do you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
Of course not,

but that doesn't matter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
You're not gonna beat this guy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:26" />

<line>
I--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
[grunting]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<line>
-What?

-Todd?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<line>
BoJack!

Thank God you found me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<line>
I thought I would never see

you again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<line>
-We're in the middle of something.

-I got mixed up in some bad stuff

and a genocide may or may not

have been perpetrated in my name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<line>
Maybe you heard about it

on the news?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<line>
No, most of the news has been about

Diane and Hank Hippopopalous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
What? Why? This is really serious.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<line>
Oh, of course your thing is serious

and my thing is just a dumb feminist

trying to get attention

by attacking a famous man, is that it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
Uh, what? No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<line>
-Eat shit, Diane!

-You eat shit!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
Diane, obviously Todd doesn't know

what you're talking about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
He spent the last few days

at Burning Man or whatever getting high.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<line>
No! That's not what happened at all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<line>
A stranger just told me to eat shit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:09" />

<line>
I don't understand why you

can't be on my side about this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<line>
I am on your side.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<line>
And I'm telling you

you're not gonna win this thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<line>
Also, P.S., when have you ever

been on my side?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
-I am always on your side.

-Really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<line>
Like when you wrote that book?

Was that you being on my side?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
You're not still mad about the book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<line>
You manipulated me

and completely took advantage of--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<line>
Guys? There is a very fragile alliance

between the Cords and the Ovians.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<line>
If we don't do something--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<line>
-Todd, nobody cares.

-Nobody cares, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<line>
Everything I did

was to help you tell the story

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<line>
I knew you wanted to tell.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<line>
You got everything you wanted

because of that book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<line>
You were a joke,

now people take you seriously.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:46" />

<line>
You were out of work,

now you got your dream role.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<line>
Okay, yes. All of that is true.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<line>
But also, you were my friend

and you hurt my feelings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<line>
And it's weird that

you never apologized for that...

and that you still won't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<line>
Well... [quietly]

I'm sorry I hurt your feelings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<line>
-Are you?

-Yes, actually. I am.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<line>
I didn't want to do that

and I probably could have

handled things better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<line>
I definitely should have.

I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:17" />

<line>
Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<line>
But this is bigger than you and me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
And I need you in my corner now

because I don't have anybody else.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<line>
Well, okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<line>
-Yeah?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
I'm in your corner.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<line>
Guys, earlier, some general

asked me if it was "a go"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
...on "that thing we talked about"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<line>
And I said, "Yes." And he said,

"God help us all" and left the room.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<line>
Now I'm not sure

that was the right answer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<line>
So, then I called Wayne to see

if I could write a story for <i>Buzzfeed.</i>

Here's the good news:

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
They'll publish anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<line>
Hey, um...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<line>
Can I talk to you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<line>
Yeah, of course. What's up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<line>
I asked you, really nicely,

not to make a big thing out of this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<line>
-Yeah, I know, but someone--

-Had to say something, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<line>
And that someone had to be you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<line>
Because... why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<line>
I really don't get it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<line>
What is accomplished by you

being the one to take a stand on this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<line>
-Uh...

-[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:19" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<line>
This game show

is a really big deal for me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:24" />

<line>
And I know that sounds

stupid to you, and small.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<line>
But I need this to go well,

and I can't... [sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<line>
Those are death threats.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<line>
People want to murder my wife

because of what she's

saying on the news

about something that

she has nothing to do with.

</line>

<line>
"You can't. You stupid, ugly can't."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<line>
-Yeah, that doesn't say "can't."

-Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:44" />

<line>
God, you know, you'd almost

be safer in Cordovia.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<line>
Yeah, maybe I should go to Cordovia.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<line>
I'm obviously not making

a difference here.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:53" />

<line>
Actually, maybe you should.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<line>
Go feel good about yourself

and do your important work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<line>
And maybe some space

might be good for us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<line>
You don't really want me to go,

do you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<line>
Why does it suddenly matter

what I want?
