pilot the airplane!

<p>
{\an8}There were no survivors.

{\an8}In other news, the newly formed

Hollywoo "Guild of Assistants"

<p>
{\an8}is meeting with industry

power brokers today

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:20" />

<p>
{\an8}to negotiate terms

for a standard agreement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>I'm optimistic about the coming talks</i>

<i>and confident we can avoid a strike.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>Our demands are reasonable,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>and our services</i>

<i>are crucial to this industry.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<p>
All right, you little pishers,

let's wrap this up quick so you can all

go back to getting me wrong coffees.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<p>
-What do you want?

-We have one request.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<p>
To not be treated like garbage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<p>
It appears we are at an impasse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
-Where's my dry cleaning?

-Where's my car?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<p>
I don't know any of my passwords!

What's my mother's maiden name?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
I'm going into labor!

You need to call my doula!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
Will somebody please make me

a reservation at Little Dom's?

<p>
{\an8}Doctor Champ, I am so sorry.

I-- [stutters]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:08" />

<p>
{\an8}-Did anyone see me?

-You were in here all night.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<p>
{\an8}Nobody can know about this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:12" />

{\an8}There are 20 struggling addicts

in this building who are counting on me.

<p>
-This never happened.

-Agreed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<p>
But how do I get out of here

without anyone seeing me?

Yes. Plus or minus the yelling.

<p>
-Oh. Hello, Jorge.

-I have some news. It's about your mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
Oh, is the news that you're marrying her,

inserting yourself into our family

and ruining my life?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
Because I already heard that news

like 25 years ago, Jorge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<p>
-I didn't come to your home to fight.

-Then joke's on you

because you didn't come to my home at all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:31" />

<p>
{\an8}-I just sleep on the couch...

-[Jorge sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:34" />

<p>
{\an8}-...since you and Mom gave me the boot.

-That was ten years ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
Which, by the way,

is the only thing you ever gave me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:40" />

<p>
I gave you my name,

and you have clearly wasted it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
{\an8}Do you know what the Chavez name

stands for?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
{\an8}Yes, Jorge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
Chavez! C for cerebral!

H for high-minded! A for analytical!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
V for veracious! E for efficacious!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
And Z for zealously practical.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
Feels like a cheat on the Z.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
Todd, your mother needs your help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
Well, then instead of sending her husband,

she should have asked me herself,

if it's so important to her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<p>
-She's in a coma.

-A rudeness coma?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
No, a regular coma.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<p>
Oh, my God! Why didn't you open with that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<p>
Please. Your mother needs a kidney.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<p>
I put her on the donor waiting list,

but if you're a match...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
Oh. I'm sorry.

Of course I would give Mom my kidney.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<p>
-Then there's no time to waste--

-"Would" give her my kidney.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
"Would." You need to work

on your listening skills.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<p>
I sold my extra kidney just last week.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:32" />

<p>
{\an8}-Why?

-I wanted to buy these sock puppets.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
{\an8}You sold your kidney for... [groans]

I'm sorry I came.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<p>
{\an8}If you'd like to visit your mother--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<p>
Wait. What if instead

of visiting my mother,

we got my kidney back?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:46" />

<p>
{\an8}Come on, Ruthie!

<p>
Princess Carolyn, this is a catastrophe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<p>
-You know it.

-This strike has shut down the whole city!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
Assistants want respect?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<p>
If we respect them, how are we supposed

to work through our rage issues?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<p>
On our spouses and children?

That doesn't seem fair.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:13" />

<p>
There's gotta be a better way!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
Uh, maybe we could circumvent

giving the assistants what they want

by giving them what they think they want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
You know, like how we satiate TV creators

by giving them little vanity cards

at the end of episodes,

then sell the shows to streaming networks

that auto-skip the end credits

so no one even sees the vanity cards!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

But what do assistants want?

iTunes gift cards? Amazon gift cards?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
I honestly can't think of another thing

an assistant would want.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<p>
When I was an assistant,

the only thing I wanted

was not to be an assistant anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<p>
[gasps] Princess Carolyn, I'll say to you

what I said to David Levy

when we were developing

<timestamp data-time="00:05:46" />

and brainstorming ancillary characters,

like cousins and whatnot: That's Itt!

<p>
What is this? Two days ago

when I almost hit you with my car?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:07" />

<p>
[chuckles] No! That was outside!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
Listen, I've been trying

to get in touch with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<p>
I got a call from this mental health

advocacy group.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
Those guys are jizzin' their pants

over your heroic admission

of your struggle with depression,

and they wanna help you

share your story with the world.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
The world, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<p>
I wanted to set up a meeting,

but my assistant went on strike,

and phones, for me, are, like, what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<p>
Even if you had your assistant,

it wouldn't do any good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<p>
My reps' assistants

are all on strike, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<p>
Oh, bummer. Guess there's no way

to get in touch then.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:36" />

<p>
Too bad. I'd love to get together.

-To get back my kidney and save Mom

in goofy whimsical mess-arounds.

tonight's the Whitewhale

employee holiday party.

<p>
Security will be tight, but you can use

my employee ID to get in,

because I'm technically

still on the payroll.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:39" />

<p>
Wait, you didn't quit?

We haven't worked there in months.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<p>
Nobody's noticed!

They keep sending me checks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<p>
Cashing them is my way of very gradually

taking down the man from the inside.

Is this really the best use of your time?

<p>
You've been beating yourself up

about how slowly the book's going. So...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
But the book is about me

and my life, so by living my life,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:58" />

<p>
I am in fact working on the book.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<p>
You don't have to write this book

if you don't want to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:02" />

<p>
Of course I want to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<p>
Okay. I'm just saying, since you started,

you've been pretty down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
-Not yourself. Diane--

-Actually, pretty down is myself.

<p>
Can we talk about this later?

We're being rude.

one of your fancy beers?

<p>
So, all we need to do

is get into the party,

figure out where the kidneys are,

find my kidney, and sneak out,

all without drawing attention

to ourselves.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<p>
And be careful, because

if Jeremiah Whitewhale catches you,

he can legally murder you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<p>
Now, can I get anyone an imperial stout?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<p>
The barley was from Portland, Maine,

but the brewery is in Portland, Oregon!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<p>
This plan is ludicrous.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<p>
Hey, maybe instead

of criticizing everything

like you've done my entire life,

you can get on board?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<p>
It's gonna work out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
Things don't just work out, Todd!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<p>
Of course they do!

I don't know why you're so negative!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
Do you want to help Mom,

or do you wanna just go back

to the hospital and wait?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
[sighs] Okay. I'm in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<p>
[thunder rumbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
I don't feel comfortable negotiating

without my fellow assistants present.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
Yeah. This is not about that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
Good, because our demands haven't changed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<p>
Casey, it's been so thrilling to see you

grow into your role as strike captain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
[gasps] You know, there's an opening

at my company for a development exec.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<p>
I don't suppose you'd be interested?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:14" />

<p>
Oh! Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
I'd have to think about it.

I've never rea--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
You'd get overpaid to read scripts,

company credit card,

and a parking spot in the good garage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<p>
-Um...

-Plus, your own assistant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
-An... assistant?

-[thunder rumbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<p>
-That is, of course, if the strike ends.

-[giggles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
Well, that's a very generous offer,

but I'd have to talk it over

with my colleagues.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<p>
Why? Those are assistants.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
You're not one of them anymore.

You're one of us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
It's a two-year contract.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
Sign right there

and your troubles are over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<p>
[breathes heavily, exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<p>
[thunder strikes]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
[groans, shrieks]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<p>
[both cackling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:00" />

<p>
-[Ruthie giggles]

-What's so funny?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
I was just remembering a funny joke,

unrelated to this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<p>
Can you tell me what it is?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
You wouldn't get it.

It's about Zsa Zsa Gabor,

and it's no longer appropriate

in today's climate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<p>
You've made the right decision.

You're gonna love the new job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<p>
-Welcome to the team, Stacey.

-It's Case--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:18" />

<p>
[both] Hmm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<p>
Hey! [grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
Sign here to run development

for Saoirse Ronan's production company,

Saoirse and Rescue.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<p>
[Turteltaub] Mm-hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<p>
I can't be an assistant anymore!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
Shirley MacLaine threw a cactus at my head

because I set a meeting

with the wrong Steve McQueen!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<p>
How was I supposed to know

she meant the dead one? [cries]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<p>
Shh. It's okay. Just sign here

and orchestrate your own great escape.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:52" />

<p>
[Princess Carolyn chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<p>
[Turteltaub] Ooh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<p>
[car horns honking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
Okay, I'm going in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<p>
Todd, promise me

you'll be perspicacious in there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<p>
Perspicacious?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:06" />

<p>
-I don't know the meaning of the word.

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<p>
-You're Diane?

-Yes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<p>
-Nguyen?

-That is correct!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<p>
I find that hard to believe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
Wow, that's racist.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<p>
People don't always

look like their last names.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:22" />

<p>
For example, I'm white,

and my last name is Chavez.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
I thought your last name was Nguyen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
-Oh! Uh, yeah, it is! Todd Nguyen.

-Not Diane Nguyen?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
Oh, yeah! Diane Nguyen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
That's me, all right,

or my name isn't Todd Chavez.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
Well, that was a bust.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
Okay, this time,

you're Diane and I'll be Jorge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
Todd, get in the trash can.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:46" />

<p>
I know I'm a disappointment to you,

but I do not live in a trash can, Jorge,

and I haven't for several years now! Hey!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<p>
[both grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<p>
[speaking in Spanish]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
Uh... What? Sorry, I...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<p>
Oh. No Español? [speaking in Spanish]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
Uh... go ahead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
[indistinct chatter]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<p>
-Wow, that was amazing!

-No. That was logical and straightforward.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<p>
-Another club soda, please.

-[Doctor Champ] Nerd!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<p>
Doctor Champ, what is your plan?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:26" />

<p>
Just gotta drink enough to be steady.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:28" />

<p>
Then, you take me back to Pastiches

and keep me out of trouble.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
That way, you don't have to go home

and I can be a good therapy horse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:35" />

<p>
All my clients get sober, I am a winner,

put my picture on a magazine. [slurps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
Look, I can't let you go back there drunk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<p>
You don't care about me!

You're scared of this guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<p>
You can't help anybody else

unless you're honest with yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<p>
-Know what I mean?

-No. I never know what you mean.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:53" />

<p>
In fact, maybe I wouldn't be so scared

if you'd given me real therapy

over the last six months

instead of just plying me

with folksy aphorisms.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<p>
I'm not a therapist! I'm a therapy horse,

a subtle but legally

important distinction.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<p>
Besides, you wouldn't accept

real therapy from me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<p>
Oh, and why's that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:08" />

<p>
Gee, I don't know,

maybe because I'm a horse,

so I remind you of your father,

so you simultaneously resent me

and crave my approval,

an approval which,

ironically, if granted--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<p>
Yeah, I would dismiss immediately

and then use as an excuse to resent you

even more, what's your point?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<p>
My point is, you're stunted from having

healthy relationships with horses, idiot!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<p>
Oh, really? Well, if that were true,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<p>
I would have almost

no other horses in my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<p>
Right, it's almost as if all your friends

and loved ones

are humans or dogs or cats--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
But then how do you explain

the one horse I do care about,

my half-sister Hollyhock,

who is also a reminder of my father?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<p>
If your theory were true,

wouldn't I keep her at arms' length,

desperate for her to love me

but unwilling to be vulnerable enough

to allow her to hurt me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:46" />

<p>
You blockhead, she's not your father!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<p>
Hollyhock reminds you

of the horse you hate the most. Yourself!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:53" />

<p>
Okay, you got me!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<p>
My parents gave me an internalized

self-hatred of horses.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<p>
So, my horse body is a prison

that I can never escape.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<p>
This manifests in rotten behavior

because I subconsciously believe

I deserve to be punished,

but being famous, I'm never punished,

so I act out even more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
And since this pattern

is so woven into my identity,

it is unfathomable to me that it can

ever be curbed, so instead, I drink!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<p>
Uh... Check, please!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:16" />

<p>
So, the only way I can progress

is to return to my life as a sober man

and finally hold myself accountable

for my actions, past and future.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
Oh, my God, is this what therapy is?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:24" />

<p>
Why do you keep bringing me checks?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<p>
[glasses clanking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<p>
Uh... Doctor Champ?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<p>
[elevator dings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
Wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<p>
-Sorry, folks!

-[both gasp]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:35" />

<p>
This floor's off-limits.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<p>
-Oh, but...

-Oh, thank God you're here!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
I saw someone at the buffet

putting ketchup on a hot dog.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<p>
-What? Not in my town!

-[keys jangling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
[elevator dings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<p>
-Wow, you are really good at this.

-Let's go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<p>
[gasps] Ooh, wow. Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
Oh, look. People who selected kidneys

might also enjoy small intestines.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:57" />

<p>
Just the kidney. We don't need

to be up-sold on other innards.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
Yes, sir.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:02" />

<p>
[beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<p>
Thank you for... [clears throat] this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:07" />

<p>
Uh. Once your mother is okay,

we will never bother you again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<p>
-I know that's what you want.

-Why would I want that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<p>
-You never understood me.

-I raised you as my own flesh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:18" />

<p>
I was tough on you

because I expected big things from you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<p>
You weren't tough. You were mean.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<p>
-Because the world is mean!

-Not my world!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<p>
I wanted so much for you, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<p>
I wanted to push you to be your best self.

I see now that I failed you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
But you didn't fail me

because I am not a failure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
Look... [sighs] Okay, Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
Why do you need to be proud of me

on your terms?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
Why can't you see I'm living a good life?

I have friends. I have a job--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
You sleep on the couch

and you play with puppets all day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<p>
I'm happy, Jorge.

What more do you want from me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<p>
I want to know that you're okay!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
Then why haven't you called in ten years?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<p>
You don't think I wanted to?

I'm not the one who...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<p>
-What?

-[Jorge exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<p>
She loves you, your mother.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<p>
But she's very proud.

If you called her, she would talk to you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<p>
Well, she can't talk now

because she's in a coma, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<p>
[sighs] Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<p>
What are they talking about?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<p>
-Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.

-[keys beeping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
[groans] Chavezes! You got company!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:21" />

<p>
Get out of there now! Do you read me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
[Diane on radio] <i>Hello? Hello?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<p>
Diane? Why is there a walkie-talkie

in our kitchen?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<p>
-God damn it!

-[man] Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<p>
Excuse me? This garage

is for shopping center customers only.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<p>
[groans] Okay, fine, I'll buy a pretzel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<p>
-Or you could just leave.

-No, now I want the pretzel.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<p>
[Guy]<i> Hey, Diane, get me a pretzel,</i>

<i>too, please. Love you, okay?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<p>
[Jorge gasps] Someone's coming.

We have to go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<p>
I'm not going until I get my kidney.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<p>
-Todd, this is serious.

-Yes, I understand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<p>
You are very serious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
You read serious books

and listen to Sirius XM.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
We have to go right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
-Hey!

-Why do you always fight me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
Why do you always try

to make me leave places?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
-[man] Hey!

-[both gasp]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
Stay right where you are!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<p>
-Whoa! [exhales]

-[grumbles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<p>
Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:17" />

<p>
Uh, I'm sure the other assistants

will be here any minute.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
Traffic's real bad because of the rain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<p>
No one else is coming, Stuart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
-Uh... because of the rain?

-They got promoted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<p>
Your ranks are divided.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
Your leadership has abandoned you.

Face it, the strike is over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
Whoa. Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
We've drawn up a new collective agreement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<p>
You get none of the things you asked for

and you start work again Monday.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
Sounds fair.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<p>
If I sign this, does that mean

I get a promotion, too?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
-Sure, Stuart. Someday.

-[gasps]

<p>
[Marv] Princess Carolyn,

I'd love to give you a raise,

but you're thinking like an assistant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<p>
Any day now, you're gonna get promoted

to agent and sign a brand-new contract,

so why are you concerning yourself

with these assistantly trifles?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
You really think I have

what it takes to be an agent?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<p>
Someday, sure!

But for now, you're my assistant,

and since you've got a similar build

to the angry lady

I fell on at the post office,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
I need you to try on these apology bikinis

and report back where they pinch.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<p>
-[groans]

-You got it, boss.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
[gasps] Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<p>
-[Stuart] Um...

-Stuart, don't sign that!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<p>
I just remembered

there's a typo on page 12!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<p>
Instead of "billable hours,"

I wrote, "Billy Bob showers!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<p>
Ooh, that's not gonna fly, P.C.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<p>
That guy hasn't showered since <i>Bad Santa.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
<i>Man Who Wasn't There?</i>

More like "Man Who Doesn't Wash There."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<p>
<i>Sling Blade?</i> More like "Please Bathe!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
<i>Monster's Ball? </i>More like "Monster Balls."

Great actor, though.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
Let me fix up a new version

and you can come back

and sign it tomorrow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<p>
I'll walk you to your car.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<p>
Well, this is my car.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:56" />

<p>
-Really?

-No. I don't own a car.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
[scoffs] So why did we walk

three blocks in the rain?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
I panicked! I've never been in charge

of where to go before!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:04" />

<p>
You're clearly out of your depth

in these negotiations.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
Take this number.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:08" />

<p>
Wow. This a lot of money,

Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<p>
That's not an offer, it's a phone number!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
Oh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
-Can you drive me home?

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<p>
-Officer, I...

-Sir, did this man attack you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
-What? No.

-You can tell me if he attacked you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
-Hey! Keep your hands where I can see 'em.

-Look, this is all a misunderstanding.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
I'm just trying to take

this kidney back to my mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<p>
Whitewhale's got like a hundred of these.

He won't even miss this one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
Well, aren't you a little scamp.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
-[both laugh]

-Oh, stop!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<p>
What?

<p>
What the...? Hey, who's in my chair?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<p>
Mr. Turteltaub,

I thought our meeting was at 9 a.m.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
-It appears to be 9:03.

-[sighs] Hello.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
If you're serious about negotiating,

it's imprudent to send the message

you don't respect our time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<p>
To start these negotiations

on the right foot,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<p>
I suggest we adjourn for the day

and start in earnest tomorrow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
-On schedule?

-Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<p>
-Okay?

-Fabulous. Princess Carolyn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:13" />

<p>
Judah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<p>
-What the shell was that?

-Let the negotiations begin.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
[clears throat]

Todd, I, uh... owe you an apology.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:29" />

<p>
-Oh?

-[inhales, exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<p>
I know I was hard on you

when you were growing up,

but I was trying to protect you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
Nothing came easy for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
It took hard work, focus, discipline

to get me where I am today.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<p>
Things didn't just work out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<p>
But I should have realized: you're white.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:49" />

<p>
I forgive you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<p>
She's awake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
Do you wanna come say hello?

I'm sure she would love to see you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<p>
Well, she has my number.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
-That's cold, Todd.

-What do you expect?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<p>
I'm a Chavez, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<p>
Hmm...

</p>

<p>
{\an8}[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<p>
-Huh? Where am I?

-You're at Partridges,

the rehab clinic

founded by Danny Bonaduce.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
-What about Pastiches?

-I told them I was checking you in here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
Why would you do that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
Those people need me

to be an example of success.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<p>
You can't help anybody else

unless you're honest with yourself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
-A wise man told me that.

-Who? What wise man?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:28" />

<p>
You did.

I was being poetic and you ruined it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
Well, don't listen to me. I'm a drunk!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<p>
Yeah. But the first step is admitting it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<p>
You've destroyed me.

I can never go back to Pastiches now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<p>
My husband will leave me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
I promised him I would never drink again

after what happened to our daughter.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
Uh... What happened to your daughter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:45" />

<p>
You know nothing of my life

and you think you know what's best for me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:50" />

<p>
The only reason I got drunk

in the first place

is because of your contraband vodka!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<p>
-Well, yes, technically, that's true.

-Of course you did this to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<p>
Because I cared about you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<p>
And you ruin people who care about you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:02" />

<p>
[exhales] Well, best of luck.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<p>
I want you to remember this, BoJack.

I want you to remember what you did to me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<p>
I remember everything. I'm sober now.
