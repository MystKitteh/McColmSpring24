</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<p>
-I know, I know.

-I'm just glad you showed up.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<p>
The waitstaff was starting

to get suspicious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:16" />

<p>
See? I'm not a liar! I do have a wife!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
-All right. You're trying to embarrass me.

-And I did. And now I'm fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<p>
-Hi, you.

-Hi, you. [kisses]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<p>
Long day at the office?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
-I lost them, Indira.

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:28" />

<p>
In all my years of corporate mediation,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
I've never been unable to resolve

a dispute before it goes to arbitration.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<p>
I'm Mary-Beth, the Mediating Maven.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
I'm sure you helped them

in ways you'll never even know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<p>
-I-- Don't therapize me.

-[chuckles] But you're so easy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:42" />

<p>
You make me feel like

I'm actually good at it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<p>
What's going on with you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<p>
-It's been a tough week.

-Tell me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
Mm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<p>
-I shouldn't talk about my clients.

-Come on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<p>
What if you changed all the names

and identifying characteristics?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
Okay. This is a story about...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:57" />

<p>
Bo... Bo... BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

-[Indira] <i>So, it all started on Monday.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:59" />

<p>
<i>I was in a session with Diane--</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:01" />

<p>
<i>...a! Diana.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<p>
[Mary-Beth] <i>Like Diana,</i>

<i>Princess of Whales?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />

<p>
[Indira] <i>Exactly.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<p>
It's just so tough

being Princess of Whales.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:08" />

<p>
Like, I can't be all things to all whales.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<p>
-You're deflecting.

-I'm not!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:11" />

<p>
Let's talk about the BoBo tape.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<p>
{\an8}What's the BoBo tape?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:14" />

<p>
{\an8}She recently came into possession

of an audiotape

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:17" />

<p>
{\an8}of her friend and co-worker,

BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<p>
[BoBo] <i>On the boat. There was a girl.</i>

<i>In New Mexico.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:25" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>And she trusted me. Also, I'm a zebra.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:28" />

<p>
{\an8}-What girl is he talking about?

-I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:31" />

<p>
{\an8}"Girl" sounds young, right? [scoffs]

Whatever it is, it's gotta be bad,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<p>
{\an8}because, otherwise,

why wouldn't he tell me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<p>
{\an8}Diana, you are not responsible

for the dysfunction of others.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<p>
{\an8}I actually explore this in my book,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<p>
<i>Are You Responsible</i>

<i>For The Dysfunction of Others?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:45" />

<p>
Spoiler alert: You're not!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<p>
I just wish I could talk to him about it,

but he's like an open sore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<p>
{\an8}Attention! As some of you

might have heard, my mom died recently.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<p>
I know you're very concerned,

but I wanna let you know

it will not affect my work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<p>
I'm here, and I'm doing fine.

I just want to focus on the show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<p>
{\an8}So, please treat this like any other day,

and be extra-nice to me

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:04" />

<p>
{\an8}because I am a famous actor,

not because my mom died.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:08" />

<p>
{\an8}[all murmuring]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<p>
Thank you. Good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<p>
{\an8}Yes, that's what I'm looking for.

Just go about your business.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:14" />

<p>
{\an8}That's good 'cause I don't want to talk

about my mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
Hmm. [grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
-Hey. Did you hear my mom died?

-Yeah. But you don't wanna talk about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<p>
No. Pretty weird she died, though, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:25" />

<p>
-Do you want to talk about it?

-No. I'm just saying it's weird.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<p>
-BoBo. I am so sorry.

-And I so don't wanna talk about it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:32" />

<p>
Obsessed with my mom much?

You're the one with issues.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
{\an8}I feel like he wants me to comfort him,

but I'm still angry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
{\an8}Maybe you could both use some space

from each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
{\an8}Why don't you tell him you need

to focus on your work?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<p>
{\an8}What work?

Flippy won't let me do anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:46" />

<p>
[dolphin voice]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<p>
Flippy? Are you okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<p>
{\an8}[squeaking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<p>
Hey, what are we filming today?

Why is there a submarine set?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
{\an8}[squeaking continues]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<p>
[Diana] Interior sub?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
{\an8}Why didn't you just write "way"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
Okay. So, now we just need

to come up with a scene

that takes place in a submarine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<p>
-Ah!

-Did you hear my mom died?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:28" />

<p>
[Indira] How about this?

If he wants to talk,

and you aren't can't confront him,

tell him your<i> therapist</i> says

you need space.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<p>
That's where I went wrong.

I inserted myself into her story.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
Don't beat yourself up.

Remember what Doctor Janet said?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:41" />

<p>
[bells in accordance to stick]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<p>
Tell me about your day.

You had a tough workplace mediation?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:47" />

<p>
Whoo! The problem with these two

is they don't just work together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<p>
They also live together.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<p>
[grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<p>
What a beautiful morning!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:57" />

<p>
[Indira] Wait, wait,, wait. Hold on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
If your story can have Princess Diana,

why can't mine have Emperor Finger-Face?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
It's not actually Princess Diana.

She's just named Diana.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<p>
I've been picturing Princess Diana.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
Okay, fine. Tell me what happened

with Emperor Finger-Face.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<p>
He lived in the same apartment

as a Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning

in the shape of a woman.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
Good morning, Emperor Finger-Face!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<p>
Good morning to you,

Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<p>
-See you tonight?

-Afternoon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<p>
I wanna talk to you,

so I set a meeting through your assistant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
-Have you seen my keys?

-Butter tray in the fridge.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
I think I put them there

during one of my night terrors.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<p>
I don't have time to go to the kitchen.

I'll just hotwire my car.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<p>
-Hey, did you eat breakfast?

-No time for meals.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<p>
I just grab whatever I can,

whenever I can.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<p>
Hold on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<p>
I know you're a gal on the go,

but even tangled fogs of pulsating

yearning need to eat right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<p>
I'll get something on set.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
Pinky swear? [horn] Ow! I poked my face!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
I feel I'm having a hard time

following the story

because of how weird

you made the characters.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<p>
The important thing is that these two

have been living together

for almost a year with virtually no drama.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:02" />

<p>
In some ways, it's the most functional

relationship either have ever been in!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
Oh, okay. I guess that's not that weird.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
Great! Now, back to the story

of the fog and the hand!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
-So. What can I do you for?

-I have no workspace on set.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
I was hoping we could allocate some money

to get me an office.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
Oh, look, here's the exact paperwork

you need all filled out and ready to go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:22" />

<p>
-Okay.

-Just needs your signature.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<p>
-Let me retrieve my pen.

-Marvelous!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
Yep, I am currently gripping my pen

inside my jacket.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
Now to just pull it out

and sign this document.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<p>
Just goes to show,

you get what you need

if you pull the right strings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<p>
Strings?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
-[gasps] It was you!

-What was me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
The last string cheese in the apartment,

I was saving it. And you took it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
And now you want me to give you an office?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:48" />

<p>
What?! I didn't take your cheese.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
Uh-oh, are we having

a work-related conflict?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<p>
This feels like more of a

you-crashing-on-my-couch-related conflict.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
When I started here,

I signed a contract that said,

all intra-office disputes

must be resolved via mediation,

or failing that, forced arbitration.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:09" />

<p>
Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
So, then I-- You're not eating.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
I just-- I keep thinking

about BoBo the Zebra.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:15" />

<p>
Okay, what happened next with BoBo?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<p>
Well, he wanted to get back to work,

but since Flippy had writer's block,

there was nothing for the actors to do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<p>
How is there nothing to shoot?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:24" />

<p>
So, what, I just have to wait around,

and be alone with my thoughts? Gross.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:28" />

<p>
When I was on<i> The Murder-Stoppers.</i>

we had to shut down production

because Nick Nolte wouldn't come out

of his trailer.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<p>
He wasn't even on the show!

He was in one of our trailers,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<p>
-and we couldn't get him out!

-Is it hard to write a script, Gino?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<p>
"Oh, I'm Philbert, bang, bang.

I'm a tough guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<p>
My wife is dead! Did I kill her?

Who knows? I'm cool."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
That was pretty good.

Can we just roll on that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:45" />

<p>
When there's something to shoot,

we'll shoot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
Meanwhile, you wanna go bang one out

in your trailer? I'll get my diaphragm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<p>
Nah, I'd just be thinking about

my dead mom the whole time,

which would either ruin it or--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
Oh, God, what if it makes it better?

I don't wanna know that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<p>
-You want me to just get you some pie?

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:59" />

<p>
-Yes.

-Okay, big guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<p>
[BoBo sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:02" />

<p>
-[sympathetic voice] Hey, buddy.

-Hey, Mr. Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:05" />

<p>
Really sorry about your mom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<p>
No, it's fine. I'm fine. It's really fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
It must be so hard to lose a loved one.

I, for one, never have.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<p>
You've never lost a loved one?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:14" />

<p>
-When my mom got old, she moved to a farm.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
In the country, where she could have

plenty of room to run free.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<p>
Why would she wanna run around

if she's old?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:21" />

<p>
You know,

I never really questioned the logic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:23" />

<p>
My brother set it up.

I haven't been able to visit,

but everyone in my family

goes to that farm eventually.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<p>
-Oh, dude, your mom's dead.

-What? No. She's at a farm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
After a prolonged bout of Parkinson's.

A farm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
Where they don't have telephones,

or the internet, and... Oh, my God.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<p>
She's dead. My mom is dead!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

<p>
-[sobbing]

-Whoa!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<p>
[BoBo groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
Oh, there... There, there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<p>
[Flippy squeaking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<p>
-What's going on with this submarine?

-My therapist doesn't want me

talking to you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<p>
-What?

-My therapist, Dr. Indira,

says it would be good

if you gave me some space.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
-Why would she say that?

-Don't know. I'm just the client.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
-Her call, not mine. I should go.

-Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:58" />

<p>
Everybody? My dear mother

has transcended this plane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:02" />

<p>
-[all] Aw.

-I am incredibly fragile

and could use all the support I can get,

so if everyone could pay

a lot of attention to me,

and ask me a lot of questions

about my mother,

and maybe tell me stories

about your mothers,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<p>
I think that would really make me

feel a lot better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
Sure, Mr. Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<p>
-[man] So sorry for your loss.

-This is a very healthy way to grieve.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<p>
-[applause]

-Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:22" />

<p>
So, a brief recapitulation:

this is not a room

for repudiation or condemnation

over string cheese

appropriation accusations.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<p>
Mediation is an invitation

for open conversation,

frustration de-escalation,

and exchange of information,

which, in summation,

removes any justification for litigation

involving this corporation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
Nobody was going to litigate anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<p>
That's fabulous,

because you legally cannot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<p>
Now, tell me about your journey

into the woods of conflict.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<p>
Well, this very Wednesday, October 24th,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
I was excited to come home

to some string cheese. The very last one.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
I'd been saving it all week.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
-All week until Wednesday?

-That is correct.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
I measure my weeks Thursday to Wednesday.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
-Why would you--

-Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
Emperor Finger-Face has the floor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
I was gonna melt it down

and then sculpt it

into a Mozzarella Cinderella!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>
But when I got home,

my string cheese was gone!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
Doesn't mean I took it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
Tangled Fog, watch yourself.

Or I'll turn on this fan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<p>
Well, this morning you said yourself

that when it comes to eating,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<p>
-you just grab whatever you can.

-Can we use "I" statements?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<p>
[shouts] Ai, ai, ai! You took my cheese!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<p>
You probably ate it yourself

during one of your night terrors!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<p>
We know you opened the fridge.

You put my keys in there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<p>
I can't eat while I'm terrified.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
That's why I'll never know

the delicious crunch of Count Chocula.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<p>
-[shudders]

-That still doesn't mean I took it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
-You will both have a chance to--

-Come on!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
We both know you drift around

the apartment like you own the place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
-It's my apartment!

-[shouts and thumps] And it's my cheese!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:53" />

<p>
Oh, boy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
[tires screech]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:56" />

<p>
-[grunts] Who do you think you are?

-[gasps] Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<p>
-I'm Dr. Indir--

-I know who you are!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
You know how many therapists

there are named Indira?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
Google filled in your last name for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<p>
Why did you tell Diana

that she needed space from me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
Would you like to have a seat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<p>
No, I don't wanna "have a seat,"

and here's why.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
Therapists are manipulative leeches...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<p>
So, when Jerry Lewis

mistook me for the valet,

he was carrying so much pain

I could never fathom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
-Mm...

-And that realization

allows me to forgive.

Not for his sake, but for mine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:28" />

<p>
-Mm-hmm.

-Wow. How long was I talking?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:30" />

<p>
I hope that was cathartic for you.

You wanna come back same time tomorrow?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<p>
Wait a minute, I see what's going on here.

Are you... my new best friend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<p>
[sighs] Uh...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
Ugh, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm hogging

all the conversation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
There's definitely more to your story

than mine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<p>
Mine's more like a secondary story.

A B-story, if you will.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<p>
I have a feeling it will continue

to offer a light alternative,

as my story gets increasingly serious.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<p>
Let's continue to switch back and forth

between our stories,

pausing at their most interesting moments.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<p>
That feels like the most natural way

to have a conversation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:02" />

<p>
Well, while I was talking to BoBo,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<p>
Diana was trying to keep things together

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
-on set.

-I thought it was my turn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:07" />

<p>
-[gasps] Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

-[Diana] Okay, cut?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<p>
-[buzzer blares]

-Why is Sassy saying "Oh, my God?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
I just figured,

we've got all these people here,

we might as well film some stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
Presumably something shocking will happen,

and then if it does,

we have a shot of you saying,

[mimics Gino] "Oh, my God!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<p>
-Makes sense.

-Diana, can I talk to you for a sec?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<p>
I know you're going through something,

and need boundaries,

but this isn't personal,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<p>
-it's about the show.

-Ah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<p>
[Diana grunts, sighs] What is it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<p>
I lied. It's a 100% personal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
-What?

-But it's good! You're gonna like this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:35" />

<p>
-Remember you said you needed space?

-Yes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
When you told me that,

I didn't take it well.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
-Uh...

-But I made a new friend,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<p>
-so everything is good now.

-Oh. Well, that's great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
I'm glad you think so because, fun twist,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<p>
-it's Dr. Indira.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<p>
I'm seeing Dr. Indira now, as a friend.

Dr. Indira's my new friend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<p>
-No.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<p>
It's great that you would wanna talk

to someone, and you should!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<p>
But she's mine.

I really need her to just be mine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
-Can you understand that?

-[sighs] Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
Diana asked me not to be friends with you,

so out of respect for her,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<p>
I think it's best that I continue

seeing you behind her back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<p>
We can still do our lunchtime hang outs,

but to cover our tracks,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:13" />

<p>
I'll compensate you

for your time on the books.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<p>
Ιt'll seem as if you have a client.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<p>
And, to be safe, we should invoke

a therapist-to-friend confidentiality.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:19" />

<p>
How's that sound?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
So, in my dreams, I'm Philbert,

and sometimes when I wake up,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<p>
I don't know if I'm Philbert or if I'm me,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
-or if I'm still dreaming.

-[watch beeping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<p>
Oh, that's our time of friendship hour.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<p>
I'm just so glad that I can help break up

your day of listening to whiny babies

with some entertaining lunchtime convo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<p>
Should I have told him

what we were doing was therapy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:41" />

<p>
On some level, he must have known

what was going on.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
What I don't understand is,

if you knew Diana asked him

not to see you--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:47" />

<p>
I'm a therapist. A doctor heals.

A DJ spins.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<p>
Jessica Chastain takes whatever gig

Amy Adams says no to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<p>
My job is to listen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:56" />

<p>
And at that moment,

BoBo needed someone to listen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<p>
I know the feeling.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<p>
Okay, we've been going back and forth

for two hours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<p>
Can we take a break?

I gotta use the bathroom. If I even can!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
Maybe it's just another hand down there!

Guess I'll find out!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<p>
Why not just say you took the cheese?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<p>
-Because I didn't.

-You want an office, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<p>
There's nothing wrong with telling

a small lie to avoid a fight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:18" />

<p>
I do it all the time with my wife,

Doctor, uh, Underwear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:22" />

<p>
-Heh?

-I love your new hairstyle, honey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<p>
-Did you not like my new hairstyle?

-Oh! Um... Back to my story...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<p>
All you have to do

is tell Emperor Finger-Face

what he wants to hear.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<p>
Fifty-nine cents worth of edible string

for a brand-new office?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<p>
Wouldn't you take that deal?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<p>
So, turns out I can use the bathroom,

but it comes out in tiny cubes!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
Hey. I took the string cheese.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
Ha, ha! I knew it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:48" />

<p>
Wonderful. So, she can replace the cheese

and you'll give her an office. We did it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
Great! Let me just grab my pen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
-But even if I did take the cheese--

-Which you just admitted you did!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<p>
Would I be in the wrong?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
I mean, it is kind of a "fair game food,"

don't you think?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:03" />

<p>
-What?

-It's not like it's a sandwich.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<p>
Some foods are just widely understood

to be up for grabs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<p>
-No. You guys.

-[Finger-Face] Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:09" />

<p>
Well, then let's make a list

of fair game foods.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:12" />

<p>
Grapes. Fair game. Eggs. Fair game.

An unsliced pie. Not fair game.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<p>
A sliced pie. Fair game.

The last slice. Not fair game.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<p>
Then let's also make a list

of what's fair game to me in my apartment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<p>
Oh, that's right, everything,

you literal knucklehead.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<p>
Oh, ho-ho!

That's a solid diss coming from a gas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
Please, you two,

we can still reach an agreement.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<p>
I don't know. I think this might go

beyond simple mediation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<p>
-No!

-Damn it, we're going to arbitration!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:41" />

<p>
[shouts] <i>Nooooooooooo!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:44" />

<p>
Hey, Flippy. I got everyone saying,

"Oh, my God." How's it going in here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<p>
"Interior sub. Philbert. Philbert.

Flap, flap, flippy, flap. Fart. Barf.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:55" />

<p>
Barf me a river, fartbag."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<p>
{\an8}[squeaking]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<p>
What's going on in here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<p>
{\an8}[squeaking continues]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
If it relieves any pressure,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:05" />

<p>
I don't know that everyone thinks

you're a brilliant genius.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
I think we need to simplify.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<p>
Let's start with Fritz.

Is he a ghost or is he not a ghost?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:14" />

<p>
Can't he just be a ghost?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<p>
So, why is Philbert seeing a ghost?

Maybe he feels haunted?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:22" />

<p>
And Fritz represents that?

What is haunting Philbert?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:26" />

<p>
That's great. But also...

Maybe something involving a submarine?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
You keep thinking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:34" />

<p>
Hey, are we about to shoot something?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<p>
I'm meeting a friend for lunch.

You don't know her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
It's gonna be a while still.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<p>
Flippy is working through his "process."

And I am helping.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:43" />

<p>
Sounds good. Just remember,

you are not responsible

for the dysfunction of others.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<p>
I'm just saying don't let him

get you down.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<p>
Where did you hear that?

About the dysfunction of others?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
I don't know. Just around.

It's a thing people say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:55" />

<p>
[Diana] Mm...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<p>
Hey, are we gonna get new pages today

or what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
W-w-wait, did you say "Princess Carolyn"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<p>
I'm sorry, "Priscilla Crustacean."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<p>
<i>Vamanos,</i> on the pages, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:05" />

<p>
I've been here all day today,

Wednesday, October 24th,

waiting for something to shoot.

<i>Andele, andele, andele!</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:12" />

<p>
I think your Priscilla Crustacean

is the same person

as my Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning

in the shape of a woman!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:19" />

<p>
And if she was on set all day

Wednesday, that means--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:22" />

<p>
Bu-- Hold on,

I'm getting to the juicy part.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<p>
As soon as I get the thing,

I don't want it anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:28" />

<p>
It feels cheap.

So, no, I wouldn't like a bottle of water.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<p>
-[Diana grunts]

-Emotionally naked!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
-I knew it!

-Diana! Let me explain.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
How long has he been your client?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
-Not a client.

-Three--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<p>
Days. Friends for three days.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<p>
I asked you not to see her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<p>
I asked for one part of my life

that I could have to myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:45" />

<p>
News flash, you're not the only one

going through shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<p>
Maybe if I could talk to you,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<p>
I wouldn't need to be looking

for other friends.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:51" />

<p>
Diana, is there anything you'd like

to discuss with BoBo?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<p>
We can do it right here.

This is a safe space.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
No. This doesn't feel

like a safe space anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<p>
I can't keep coming here

if I know you're also seeing him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<p>
Then it sounds like

our time together is done.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:07" />

<p>
What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:07" />

<p>
You're setting a boundary.It is good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<p>
Go forth with the tools I've given you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<p>
Live your life, Diana.

Like a candle in the wind.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<p>
-I can't believe this is happening.

-I think BoBo needs me more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<p>
-Would you like validation?

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<p>
Your validation is worthless to me now.

You two deserve each other.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<p>
[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:24" />

<p>
Oh, you meant parking validation.

I actually would like that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:27" />

<p>
Wow, I can't believe you chose BoBo

over your client of seven years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<p>
At a certain point,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:32" />

<p>
I can't hold myself responsible

for other people's dysfunction.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:35" />

<p>
I mean, that is kind of your job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<p>
But at least now you can help

the Angsty Zebra, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
Well...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
-Okay. Now for the real work to begin.

-Real what now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<p>
You did the hard part,

admitting you need help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<p>
Did I admit that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<p>
And now comes the even harder part,

getting the help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<p>
-Let's talk about your mother.

-You know what? This has been great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<p>
I got what I wanted

and I made so much progress!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<p>
So, I think I'm done?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<p>
-Yes. You did it!

-I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<p>
You changed my stripes!

Dr. Indira, you're great at your job!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
-Goodbye forever.

-W-w-w-wait!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<p>
I can't believe I lost two clients

in one day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<p>
You're focusing on the negative.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<p>
I'm sure you helped them

in ways you'll never know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<p>
This area's all mine.

This is fair game. Ya see the line?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
What about popcorn?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<p>
Popped is mine. Unpopped is fair game.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<p>
-Hello?

-[Mary-Beth] <i>Todd.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
Princess Carolyn was on set all day,

the day of the string cheese theft.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
She was not home

when the cheese went missing,

rendering any arbitration agreement made

under those conditions null and void.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<p>
Whoa! Thanks a lot, Mary-Beth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
Just doing my job, kid.

A doctor heals. A DJ spins.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:42" />

<p>
Bryce Dallas Howard takes the gigs,

Jessica Chastain says no to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<p>
And Mary-Beth mediates.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<p>
So, it sounds like

you didn't take my string cheese.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:52" />

<p>
That's what I've been saying!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<p>
I don't even know why we had to go through

corporate mediation in the first place!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<p>
I guess I just wanted it to be

a workplace dispute,

because I thought if you knew

it was a roommate dispute,

you might kick me out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<p>
I'm not gonna kick you out.

I like having you around.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<p>
Oh, really?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<p>
Who else would I get to keep my keys cold?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<p>
You know, I have this job now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<p>
Maybe I could start paying,

I believe it's pronounced "roaunnt?"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<p>
Rent? Well. That's a great idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<p>
But I also need my own space.

Which is why I wanted that office.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<p>
Well, then, let's get you that office.

I just need to grab my pen.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<p>
-Hey!

-Ugh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:32" />

<p>
Hey. I want to apologize...

for my behavior at Dr. Indira's.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<p>
-Don't worry about it.

-She was right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
You need her more than I do.

And I think she can really help you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<p>
Help with what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
I was looking for someone

to hang out with during my lunch.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
I didn't want some

psycho-babbling quack job

telling me to get in touch

with my feelings.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<p>
-Who needs that?

-I do. I need that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<p>
You don't anymore!

She said it herself, you're fixed!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
And then after you left, I was like,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
"Hey, if Diane doesn't need this,

I don't need this."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
Wait, you quit?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<p>
Yeah, I'm not someone therapy works on.

I might be too smart.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<p>
Oh, my God. You haven't changed at all.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
Whoa, whoa.

Diane, no, no. I'm not the problem here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
None of this would have happened

if I felt like I could talk to you,

my friend, after my mother died.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<p>
So, would you like to talk

about your mother?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<p>
No, I'm just saying as an example.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<p>
Why do you bring things back to my mother?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:20" />

<p>
I can't keep playing this game with you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
You say you wanna get better

and you don't know how.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<p>
Well, here's me, your friend,

telling you how: get therapy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<p>
Otherwise, don't waste my time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
Uh, you heard Dr. Indira.

She said we don't need her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<p>
She said I don't need her!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
I know, but you're just as screwed up

as I am.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
-So, if--

-I am not as screwed up as you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<p>
Diane, it's me. Come on. We're the same.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<p>
[gasps] We are not the same!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
-[Diane grunts]

-Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
-[Diane huffs, hums]

-[typing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:50" />

<p>
Whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<p>
That's good stuff. We're doing it, Diane.

We're doing it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:57" />

<p>
I wanna thank everyone

for being so kind this week.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
Losing a mother is not easy,

but I am so lucky to have

the support system of my Philbert family.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:05" />

<p>
You know who I really feel bad for

is my dad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
He's out on that farm all by himself,

and-- Oh, my God. My dad is dead!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:12" />

<p>
-[all] Aw.

-Cheer up, everyone!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
-We got new pages!

-All right!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
We're gonna film in the living room

with Philbert and Sassy Malone first.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
We're moving into the submarine

for the flashback.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
No time to learn lines.

We gotta make up for the lost days,

so we're gonna put the whole thing

on cue cards. Let's go!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<p>
{\an8}-All right, everybody stand back.

-[murmus]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
[sobbing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<p>
We need lights on the living room!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
And action!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<p>
Tell me what happened

in the submarine, Philbert.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<p>
We were doing a routine

submarine sting operation.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<p>
Things got outta hand.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<p>
-Hey. Who do you work for?

-Well, I sure as hell don't work for tips.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<p>
-[chuckles]

-[men gasping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<p>
Okay. Hey, Fritz. Be cool. Everybody cool.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
We are in a pressurized submarine

in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
Mm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:53" />

<p>
Easy... [inhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
-[all gasping, grunting]

-[gunfire]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<p>
-Oh, my God! You killed them all?

-We had to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<p>
These poor guys.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
I wonder if they had kids,

families who will never know--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<p>
Can you just say the lines, please?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<p>
Barf me a river, fartbags.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<p>
We gotta make this look like an accident.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<p>
You grab the contraband,

I'll set up the explosives. [panting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<p>
[BoJack] <i>I went to the room</i>

<i>where they were keeping the stuff.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<p>
<i>-Only there was no stuff.</i>

-Oh, my God!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<p>
There was a girl there.

She couldn't have been older than 17.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
Bring in the girl!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:26" />

<p>
What? What is this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:27" />

<p>
Keep going! We gotta get this tonight!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:30" />

<p>
[Gina] <i>A girl?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:31" />

<p>
[BoJack] <i>They weren't smuggling drugs.</i>

<i>They were smuggling... her.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:34" />

<p>
-Hey. Are you okay?

-Yeah, I'm fine. Just do the scene.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:37" />

<p>
[Bojack] <i>I told her</i>

<i>it was going to be okay.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:39" />

<p>
<i>And... she kissed me.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
Wha--?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:42" />

<p>
What did you do to her, Philbert?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<p>
Nothing. Like I said, she kissed me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<p>
-Kiss her back.

-What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
We need to get you kissing her back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
-What?

-Kiss me, you idiot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
Kiss her!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:51" />

<p>
[both moaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:54" />

<p>
This whole thing is gonna blow.

We gotta bounce, friendo.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<p>
If Fritz hadn't come,

what would you have done with the girl?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<p>
{\an8}[Bojack] Part of me is sure

I couldn't go through.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:01" />

<p>
But another part knows that's a lie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:03" />

<p>
-We can't just leave her.

-[whimpering]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<p>
Use your brain, Philbert!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:06" />

<p>
{\an8}Malone, you gotta believe me.

I'm a good guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<p>
If I'd known she was there,

I never would've--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:10" />

<p>
-Tell me what happened.

-I'll be back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<p>
-You wait right here.

-Come on, loverboy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<p>
You kissed a young girl

and then left her to die.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:19" />

<p>
I'm a good guy.

I didn't know that she was--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<p>
You have to understand, I'm a good guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:23" />

<p>
-She trusted you.

-How do you make something right

when you've made it so wrong,

you can never go back?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:30" />

<p>
How did you come up with all this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:32" />

<p>
It's a story I heard once.

I just changed all the names.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:35" />

<p>
I'll never forget that night on The...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:38" />

<p>
U.S.S. New Mexico.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:40" />

<p>
Why are you telling me all this?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:41" />

<p>
It's just good to have someone to talk to.

</p>
