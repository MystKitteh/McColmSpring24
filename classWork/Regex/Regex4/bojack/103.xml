you got to give the people

even if it kills you,

even if it empties you out until

there's nothing left to empty.

No matter what happens,

no matter how much it hurts,

you don't stop dancing,

and you don't stop smiling,

what they want.

<p>
I mean, obviously,

I'm a fan of her early work

which both satirized

and celebrated

youth culture's obsession

with sex,

but I do wonder

as a third-wave feminist

if it's even possible for women

to reclaim their sexuality

in this deeply entrenched

patriarchal society,

or if claiming to do so

is just a lie we tell ourselves

so we can more comfortably cater

to the male gaze.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<p>
- Uh, what?

- But you know,

on the other hand, I worry

that conversations like this one

often dismiss her as a mere

puppet of the industry...

all that much.

<p>
All right, fine, fine, fine,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:29" />

<p>
- this house meeting--

- Your proposal has been

submitted and

is under board review.

<timestamp data-time="00:15:33" />

<p>
All right, look, I mean,

I stepped on a needle earlier.

You still there?

[record scratch]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:58" />

<p>
Okay, party's over.

Everybody out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<p>
- [all] Aw!

- Not you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<p>
You are in big trouble,

young lady.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<p>
I can't believe

you pawned my award.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<p>
It wasn't personal. I just

thought your award was stupid,

and I already have

a billion other awards,

and I wanted to get money

for drugs.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<p>
Look, things have been tough

for you, and I understand that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<p>
I know what you're

going through right now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<p>
[chuckling] Oh, you know

what I'm going through? Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<p>
Because you were on some dumb

kids show a million years ago?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<p>
- Hey, now.

- I had my own fashion line

when I was ten.

By 20, I was packing stadiums.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:29" />

<p>
I get letters every day

from boys telling me

that I was the first girl

they masturbated to.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
Literally, someone

tells me that every day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<p>
- That is gross.

- Oh-ho, I know!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<p>
You sit up here

in your little house

and feel sorry for yourself?

Oh, guess what, Bo-j,

in order to be a has-been,

you have to have actually,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<p>
- you know, been.

- You are way out of line!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
You're not my dad.

You're just a rugged, older man

who provided me with a strong,

masculine presence

during my formative years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<p>
I'm not your dad,

and you're not my child.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:59" />

<p>
We're just a man and a lady

living in a house together,

and we're both adults,

and we're both a little drunk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<p>
[both groaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:09" />

<p>
Who-o-o lit my ottoman

on fire?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
Seriously,

you seriously don't know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<p>
I'm a bad "widdle" girl.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:19" />

<p>
Yeah, you are bad,

very bad!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:21" />

<p>
You want me to put it out

with my boob?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<p>
- Uh, what?

- Your boob

is a very impractical way

to put out a fire.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<p>
What is happening?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<p>
I think you have

a serious drug problem.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:35" />

<p>
The only drug I need

is horse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<p>
Guys, guys,

what are you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
Please don't do this.

[both moaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<p>
No, no. Why are you--

[both moaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:43" />

<p>
- [whinnies]

- This is a very bad idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
[both moaning]

Can I at least get my blanket--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<p>
Let me get my blanket

out from under--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:49" />

<p>
Oh G-- Oh, my God, my arm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:50" />

<p>
- You got my arm.

- [laughs] Ow! Ow!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<p>
I'm in it now.

Oh, God, no! I'm a part of it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<p>
[both moaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<p>
I still haven't regained

the feeling in my fingers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<p>
That was the longest two minutes

of my life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:03" />

<p>
Um, I think it was a little

longer than two minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:06" />

<p>
It was longer

than two minutes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<p>
How do you not get

that this is terrible?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
Oh, you mean

from a P.R. standpoint?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

<p>
Yeah, 'cause if this got out,

oh, I would get flayed!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:15" />

<p>
Oh, I'm done being

the voice of reason.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<p>
It's exhausting.

I got to take an angry nap.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<p>
Ugh. Ugh. Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
I know. I know.

She's taking advantage of me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:27" />

<p>
Actually, it kind of feels

like you're the one

taking advantage of her.

She's the one

with substance abuse problems

and daddy issues.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:33" />

<p>
Hey, we both have

substance abuse problems

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
- and daddy issues.

- Yeah, but she came to you

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<p>
- for help.

- [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<p>
Hey, notice how

I've been ignoring you,

playing hard to get?

Only makes you want me more.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:45" />

<p>
Ugh. Go stand

on the other side of the room.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<p>
- Okay.

- Sarah Lynn, get your coat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<p>
- I'm taking you to rehab.

- Nah,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<p>
I was gonna keep hanging out

here if that's all right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:54" />

<p>
- No, it's not all right.

- What?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<p>
This place isn't good

for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:58" />

<p>
You need to go where you can

get help, real help.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:00" />

<p>
But I thought you were always

gonna be there for me

like you said.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<p>
I will always

be there for you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
Cut, let's take ten.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<p>
That's ten, everyone.

Let's make it a tight ten.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<p>
- These pages are shit.

- [coughs]

you understand?

Shit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<p>
I wouldn't wipe my ass

with these pages.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<p>
It would defeat the whole

purpose of wiping my ass.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<p>
- Phone for you.

- Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<p>
You get me points

on the back end?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:21" />

<p>
- [coughs]

- Well, I told you

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<p>
I'm not gonna do it

unless I get points.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:24" />

<p>
Oh, they can't find any?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<p>
Well, maybe they could

suck some out of my dick!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<p>
- [coughs]

- I'm on the phone.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:28" />

<p>
- You're being very rude.

- [laughs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
You promised me you would

always be there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<p>
Sarah Lynn,

this is for your own good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:36" />

<p>
You can't stay here anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<p>
Okie-doke.

I guess I'll just move out

and find

one of the billion people

who will let me party

at their house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<p>
Uh, well,

you should not do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:45" />

<p>
Oh, I know. I know,

but I can, so I will.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<p>
I'm at a place right now

where I never need

to grow as a person

or rise to an occasion

because I can constantly

just surround myself

with sycophants and enablers

until I die tragically young.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:58" />

<p>
- Wh-What?

- Yeah,

it's pretty much

too late for me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:03" />

<p>
Well, them's the breaks.

Take it sleazy, everybody.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<p>
Oh, by the way,

I called Vanessa Gecko,

and I'm meeting with her

tomorrow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<p>
- Thanks for the suggestion.

- No! No, no, no, no, no!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:13" />

<p>
Hey, you guys want to hear

my new catchphrase?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<p>
Suck a dick, dumb shits!

[blows raspberry]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:20" />

<p>
[grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:22" />

<p>
Laura, the dummy took the bait.

Now for phase two.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<p>
Is she gone?

Is it safe to come out?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<p>
Leak to the trades

that Andrew Garfield's agent

is taking meetings with his ex,

get it all over town,

wait an hour,

then get me lunch with Andrew

on the books for this weekend,

someplace Italian.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:40" />

<p>
I really blew it,

didn't I?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<p>
I mean, maybe you could

have been a better role model

when she was young, but also,

she never really had a chance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:47" />

<p>
This is what our celebrity

culture does to people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<p>
So what you're saying is,

Everything is society's fault,

and we as individuals

never need

to take responsibility

for anything?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<p>
Uh, no. Not exactly.

I was just saying that--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:59" />

<p>
Yeah. I like that.

I didn't do anything wrong

because I can't do

anything wrong

because we're all just products

of our environment,

bouncing around like marbles

in the game

of Hungry Hungry Hippos

that is our random

and cruel universe.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<p>
Wait, no, that's not even

what I'm saying--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:11" />

<p>
Yeah, It's not my fault.

It's society.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:14" />

<p>
Everything is

because of society!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<p>
- BoJack, that--

- Dude, just let him have this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:19" />

<p>
Hooray!

Everything is meaningless!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<p>
<i>Nothing I do</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<p>
So what'd you get,

anything good?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<p>
Oh, I got everything.
