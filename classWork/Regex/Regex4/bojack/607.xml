<i>I'm not kidding. The pills. Now!</i>

<i>I told you, I'm on a system now.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
<i>I'm not doing drugs. I'm not like you.</i>

<i>I don't fetishize my own sadness.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<p>
<i>No, my hands are so slippery.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
<i>Damn it, Todd. Clean up your shit.</i>

<i>You know I had sex with Emily.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<p>
<i>Turns out there's a brand of heroin</i>

<i>called BoJack.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:46" />

<p>
<i>Please don't make me go back to LA.</i>

<i>You can count on me, Herb.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<p>
[Todd]<i> You are all the things</i>

<i>that are wrong with you.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:51" />

<p>
[Diane]<i> You haven't changed.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
[BoJack] <i>Yes, you are the last person</i>

<i>to get that. I'm not gonna change.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:11" />

<p>
Goddamn...

</p>

<p>
{\an8}[BoJack sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:13" />

<p>
Sharona?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:15" />

<p>
{\an8}[Sharona] Ow! You're hurting me.

Let me go! [grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:19" />

<p>
{\an8}Sarah Lynn got into vodka.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<p>
{\an8}-Oh, my God, is she okay?

-Danny knows she got it from you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:24" />

<p>
{\an8}-It was yours.

-Mine, yours.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:26" />

<p>
{\an8}What difference does it make

who brought this particular vodka?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:28" />

<p>
{\an8}If I take the fall for this,

this whole show is over.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:30" />

<p>
And that means everything I did

was for nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<p>
-What you did?

-To Herb, I mean.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<p>
What I did to save the show,

do you understand?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:37" />

<p>
-All that's pointless if it goes away now.

-So, what am I supposed to do?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<p>
I have friends on <i>Coach</i>

who owe me a favor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:43" />

<p>
-It could be a fresh start for you.

-There's no such thing as a fresh start.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:47" />

<p>
It's an easy job.

Craig T. Nelson's balder by the day.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:49" />

<p>
What if I say n-- no?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:51" />

<p>
Nobody is asking you, Sharona.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<p>
BoJack Horseman,

would you like to share? I...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:59" />

<p>
{\an8}[stammers] I'm sorry.

I don't know who you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<p>
{\an8}This is anonymous.

BoJack Horseman? Who's that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:04" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<p>
{\an8}Um, yeah. Um...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<p>
I'm BoJack and, uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<p>
God, this feels so dumb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
{\an8}And I'm an alcoholic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
{\an8}[all] Hi, BoJack!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:22" />

<p>
Look, I can't go to the Galapagos.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<p>
{\an8}Guy, you have to.

This is an important job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<p>
{\an8}[laughs] It's the National Geographic

Swimsuit Edition.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<p>
They want me shooting behind-the-scenes

video of turtles in bikinis.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
Seems unimportant in light

of what you've been dealing with.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:35" />

<p>
{\an8}What I'm dealing with?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<p>
{\an8}Your psychiatrist said you're depressed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<p>
Okay, yeah, I've been a little depressed.

But I'm not like <i>depressed.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:42" />

<p>
I don't have depression.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
{\an8}You're smoking three packs a day,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<p>
{\an8}you've been wearing the same

pajama bottoms for weeks...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
{\an8}This is all part of my writing process.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<p>
{\an8}My best stuff comes out

when I hate myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
{\an8}[chuckles]

What stuff? No stuff is coming out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<p>
[scoffs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:55" />

<p>
{\an8}I'd feel better if you just tried

the medication your doctor prescribed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
{\an8}Well, I'd feel worse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<p>
{\an8}They put me on Prozac in college

and I was so calm and boring,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<p>
{\an8}I didn't even wanna LiveJournal.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:05" />

<p>
{\an8}And then <i>Dawson's Creek </i>got bad because

there was no one to speak truth to power.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
<i>Dawson's Creek</i> did not get bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<p>
You just started taking antidepressants,

which you should also do now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<p>
It sucks. It made me break out.

I gained weight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<p>
What if you leave and come back

to this person you don't even recognize?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<p>
I don't even recognize you now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<p>
You're making this a bigger thing

than it is. I'll be fine.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:27" />

<p>
Don't fall for one of those models.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
I'm a one-woman man.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
If that woman happens

to be a turtle in a two-piece,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
-that's just destiny.

-[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<p>
[knocks on door]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
[sighs] You're the most beautiful person

in the world to me. You know that, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<p>
[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<p>
These strike negotiations

have lasted so long,

it's like <i>Reds</i> in this boardroom.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<p>
Remember <i>Reds?</i> Two VHS tapes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<p>
That's too many tapes, I said,

but no one listens to Lenny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:59" />

<p>
How's this look?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<p>
Generous, but you're making up

the projected loss

by excising office birthday cakes.

That's unacceptable.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<p>
Everybody hates office parties.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<p>
Everyone hates the mysterious

dried fruit cubes in trail mix

but we still eat them after the other nuts

and seeds are gone

because in our undervalued,

overworked existence,

we're desperate

for any morsel of satisfaction,

whether that be cake,

unidentifiable orange fruit shards

or the occasional kind word from our boss.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
I like cake.

They can print those pictures on them now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<p>
What's the issue here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<p>
Fine. But we're grouping birthdays

so they only happen once a month.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<p>
We accept those terms.

We're left with one final issue.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
Your insistence assistants

be not treated like garbage?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<p>
From this day forth, all assistants

will be treated like recycling.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<p>
Right next to the garbage,

but with an understanding that one day,

they may be up-cycled to a higher status.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
Like a bunch of seatbelts

that got turned into a purse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<p>
Or a license plate that gets turned

into a purse. Right, Lenny?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<p>
Sure, sure. I'm green.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<p>
-We're amenable to these terms.

-Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<p>
-Judah. I meant to reach out--

-There's no need to explain,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
I know you're very busy

with work and Ruthie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:03" />

<p>
[chuckles] You have no idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<p>
I have some idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
You talked about it quite often

during the negotiations.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:08" />

<p>
This strike has been the most time I've

been able to spend with Ruthie since...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<p>
-[coos]

-...ever.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<p>
I also feel an ambivalence

about the strike ending.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<p>
The negotiations have been

quite invigorating.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:18" />

<p>
And now you're just gonna ride off

into the sunset?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:21" />

<p>
No, the sun sets in the west.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<p>
I'm riding east to my Atwater cottage.

[grunts] Goodbye.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:26" />

<p>
-Judah!

-Yes?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<p>
You're the best assistant I ever had.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<p>
You don't need <i>ever</i> in that sentence.

It's implied.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:33" />

<p>
[grunting]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
-[indistinct chattering]

-[BoJack groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
[exhales]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:41" />

<p>
-Hey! Oh, uh...

-Excuse me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:44" />

<p>
Mm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
Thank you for meeting me here.

I can't be at my house.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
Just reminds me

of what an asshole I've been.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<p>
Makes sense. Your house reminds me

of what an asshole you've been, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:58" />

<p>
-[camera shutter clicking]

-Uh... what are you doing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<p>
I'm updating my asexual dating profile

with some fresh pics.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<p>
There's still no one else on the app,

but when they join, I wanna be ready.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<p>
Look at this busted photo.

It's from over a year ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:13" />

<p>
Yeah, you gotta stay current.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<p>
Oh, man, they always ask for your job.

Oh, I actually have a job!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
Hype man for babies.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
You've really taken to this

nanny thing, huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<p>
I love it. It's so amazing

to hold a baby and look at it sleep

and think, "This is a perfect thing."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<p>
-I can't imagine.

-It's weird to think that at one point,

someone held me in their hands

and thought,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<p>
"I'm going to love this kid forever,"

you know? What happened?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<p>
What happened to what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<p>
I don't know. Moms are weird, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<p>
Um... Yeah, moms are weird.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
So, what are you gonna do now?

Just keep getting lunch with your friends?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
There was a stewardess in the meeting.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:48" />

<p>
She was talking about how every day,

she wakes up in a different place.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:52" />

<p>
I thought, "That sounds perfect."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
Every city a clean slate?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<p>
Stewardess?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:57" />

<p>
I think the preferred term

is flight servant.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<p>
[soft music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<p>
To us! And depression!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:18" />

<p>
[chuckles] Yes, but before I drink to that

and then depart with you

on a cross-country tour

of speaking engagements

as the quote-unquote "Face of Depression,"

there is something I feel

I must get off my chest.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:29" />

<p>
As it says on the cover of my last single

"You Can Tell Me Anything,"

you can tell me anything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<p>
-I am not depressed.

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<p>
Wait. How can you know that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:38" />

<p>
Well, I feel very happy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<p>
Oh, I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:42" />

<p>
[sighs] Just as I suspected, half-full!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:44" />

<p>
Hmm. That is a troubling development.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<p>
And right before our tour!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:48" />

<p>
I would be quite upset by this

if I were at all prone to depression,

which, as we've just established,

I am not.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
But isn't it possible that

you are depressed and just don't know it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:56" />

<p>
Well, I do frequently not know things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
According to the literature for this tour

that I did not read

but had my mom peruse

and then paraphrase for me,

people who seem happy can actually

be the most depressed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:08" />

<p>
Oh, no! I seem very happy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<p>
-I know.

-But wait! You seem happy, too!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<p>
Oh, no, does that mean I'm also depressed?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:14" />

<p>
-Oh, good thing we're going on this tour.

-We gotta get the word out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<p>
-A cinnabunny and a coffee, please.

-3.25.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<p>
Four and five.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:25" />

<p>
As Gandhi says, "Make the change you wish

to see in the world."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<p>
Goodbye, change. Good luck out there.

I'll miss you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<p>
-Uh, what?

-It's for the best. Go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
Just go, please.

Don't make it harder than it has to be.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
[birds chirping]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<p>
[thunder rumbling]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:48" />

<p>
-What is depression?

-Depression.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:51" />

<p>
-Who is depression?

-You or someone you love.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<p>
-Where is depression?

-A grassy field, perhaps.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
If any of these words describe you

or your feelings, you may suffer from...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:04" />

<p>
{\an8}<i>-Depression.</i>

<i>-...depression.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<p>
[doorbell rings]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:10" />

<p>
-BoJack?

-Surprise!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>
-Uh, is this a bad time or...?

-No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<p>
It's just...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:19" />

<p>
Heat's broken. Let's go for a walk.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<p>
-Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

-I didn't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
I was in LA and I didn't want to be, so...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:30" />

<p>
-I'm glad you're here.

-You doing okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
I'm doing great.

I have this wonderful boyfriend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:35" />

<p>
I got an advance

on a book of personal essays.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<p>
Me, personal essays.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<p>
I mean, who am I? Sloane Crosley?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<p>
-Who's Sloane Crosley?

-Good point. Who's Sloane Crosley?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:44" />

<p>
Yeah, who is Sloane Crosley?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<p>
Exactly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:48" />

<p>
But the headline is you're doing great?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:50" />

<p>
So great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<p>
[slurps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
-Can I crash at your apartment?

-No!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<p>
-I think I'm depressed.

-Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
It started when I was having trouble

with my book,

and then it kind of snowballed

into my boyfriend saying

I should take antidepressants.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<p>
-Are you going to?

-What's the point?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<p>
Of antidepressants? I believe the point

is to be antidepressed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<p>
Sure. Or you just flip over the nothing

and underneath there's more nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:22" />

<p>
Then you flip over that nothing

and there's more nothing underneath that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<p>
So, you just keep flipping over nothings,

all your life,

because you keep thinking

under all that nothing,

there's gotta be something,

but all you find is nothing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:36" />

<p>
Sure, but you flip over this pizza box,

uh, and look, a couch!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:40" />

<p>
We're gonna break up soon anyway.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
There's only so long before he gets tired

of the real me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
The real you being...?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
Ta-da!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<p>
You know, someone got really mad

at me recently...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:50" />

<p>
Mad? At you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<p>
I know, shocking.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<p>
And he said, "BoJack, you ruin everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<p>
-That's what you are."

-Oof.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:57" />

<p>
And it actually took him saying it

out loud

for me to realize how stupid that is,

even though I believed it for so long.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<p>
I bought into this idea that I was a thing

that couldn't be changed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<p>
So, the reason I came to Chicago is...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
I wanted to thank you

for believing in me when I didn't,

and for encouraging me

to accept the help I needed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:20" />

<p>
Hmm.

</p>

<p>
-[groans] Mm?

</p>

<p>
So, I'm really glad you're here,

but a little notice next time?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:01" />

<p>
Oh, yeah, sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<p>
I already made plans with Tawnie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<p>
-Hey.

-[screams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<p>
Hi, Tawnie. Why are you in the backseat?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<p>
Hollyhock and I are in a fight right now.

It's both minute and massive.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<p>
How can it be minute and massive?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<p>
It's a paradox.

It's Sylvia Plath wearing Saint Laurent.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<p>
[groans] Wesleyan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<p>
Anyway, we're going to a show.

You're welcome to join us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
Great. A music show? I love music.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
[discordant sounds playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:30" />

<p>
Oh, God, is this what music sounds like

when you're sober?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<p>
-Do I hate music?

-No, this sucks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:34" />

<p>
I'm just here because

I wanted to cheer up Tawnie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
I thought you were in a fight.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<p>
Yeah, but I still don't want her

to feel bad.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<p>
She's my best friend.

They cancelled all the drama classes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:44" />

<p>
What? Why?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<p>
The acting professor quit.

He got cast in a regional commercial.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:49" />

<p>
And he quit? Wow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<p>
So, yeah, now Tawnie's gotta

change her major,

which I get why that sucks,

but don't take it out on me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:57" />

<p>
I'll bet a lot of actors would love

to teach at a place like this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<p>
They're not looking for a replacement?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:02" />

<p>
Maybe they are. I don't know.

What do I look like, the Wesleyan Argus?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:06" />

<p>
Okay, I don't wanna be fighting anymore,

so can we just drop it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<p>
-You always do this.

-I'm trying to move past it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<p>
You said we were gonna meet

at Pi Café for dinner.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<p>
-I forgot.

-Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:15" />

<p>
That hurt my feelings.

Now we're just supposed to move past it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:19" />

<p>
Ah, I see. A teachable moment.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<p>
Hollyhock, people will disappoint you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<p>
You're always mad at me.

There's nothing I can say.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:25" />

<p>
Yes, some wounds will never be healed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<p>
You could say sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:29" />

<p>
-Would it even matter?

-No, words are meaningless.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:31" />

<p>
Yes. You do this thing where

you don't think you can ever be forgiven,

so you don't apologize,

but I can't forgive you

if you don't say you're sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<p>
Okay, I'm... sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:42" />

<p>
Thank you. That's all I wanted.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:44" />

<p>
-I'm sorry.

-I love you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<p>
I love you, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:47" />

<p>
Come here. Mm!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<p>
That's it?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<p>
-Come on, let's dance. [chuckles]

-Yeah!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:52" />

<p>
-Uh... [groans]

-[Hollyhock] BoJack!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<p>
I'm really glad you came to visit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<p>
-Where are you going next?

-I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:58" />

<p>
-Where is not winter?

-California?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<p>
No, I can't go back there. Not yet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:02" />

<p>
-Florida?

-[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:04" />

<p>

-Some parts of Texas?

<p>
[groans]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<p>
I'm telling you, people come

to the airport just to eat these things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<p>
But if their houses were made

of cinnamon and dough,

they wouldn't have to go anywhere!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:18" />

<p>
They could eat and live happily

in their Cinnabungalow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<p>
Well, I think it's a great idea

and this customer thinks so, too.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:25" />

<p>
-Right, Lonely Horse Guy?

-Sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<p>
He loves it! You better get in on this

before there's a bidding war.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<p>
[sighs] No, I'm not dating anyone.

Stay on topic, Mom.

<p>
-[Princess Carolyn] Oh.

-Hey.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<p>
I'm out of rehab and I realized I never

got you a baby shower gift, so... here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<p>
I'm registered at Cubs 'R' Us

and Baby Hole, but thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<p>
If I'm gonna live in that house again,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<p>
I wanna get rid of the things

that remind me of my old life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<p>
Look what Uncle BoJack

brought you, Ruthie.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<p>
It's a 1970s pop art interpretation

of the Narcissus myth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<p>
How appropriate for a baby.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:09" />

<p>
Narcissus?

I thought the painting was about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<p>
But enough about your baby,

I also have a favor to ask.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<p>
Of course you do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<p>
There's this drama professor job

at Wesleyan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:17" />

<p>
They need a reference to tell them

that I know what I'm talking about,

that I'm dependable and passionate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:23" />

<p>
So, I thought that you could do

what you've been doing for 20 years

and lie about me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<p>
I'll be back at the office tomorrow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:29" />

<p>
But have them call my cell

because my assistant is terrible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<p>
[cooing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:33" />

<p>
-Oh, shit, it walks already?

-She started a few days ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<p>
[sniffles] Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:38" />

<p>
It's okay, she sucks at it now,

but she'll get better at it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:41" />

<p>
I'm gonna miss everything.

We have this connection now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<p>
What if that goes away

when I go back to work?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:46" />

<p>
So don't go back.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<p>
What? I'm dying here, BoJack.

I need my job. I love my job.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<p>
-Okay.

-It's just...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:53" />

<p>
There's always so much stupid bullshit

to take care of there.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<p>
Aren't you the boss?

Why are you doing the stupid bullshit?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<p>
I don't know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<p>
Hey, my only responsibility right now

is to not drink and I'm barely getting by.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />

<p>
You are producing a show,

running a company,

catering to your clients,

raising a child, a Todd.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:09" />

<p>
You need your own Princess Carolyn

to take care of you.

-Oh, no! That thing was priceless.

<p>
Ah, we'll tape it back together

and call it a Rauschenberg.

</p>

<p>

When am I gonna hear about this job?

</p>

<p>

and peck out my chances?

<p>
That is so... like her.

<p>
I still can't get comfortable in my house.

<p>
It's huge and perfect, but it feels

like the worst place on earth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:53" />

<p>
No offense, Benny, living in

your storage locker sounds pretty rough.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:56" />

<p>
Every day, it just keeps getting better.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:58" />

<p>
God, you're killing me, Benny.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<p>
My house reminds me

of the horse I was before.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:03" />

<p>
I don't wanna be him again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<p>
But it's the same house, the same city,

just nothing's changed,

so how am I supposed to?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:17" />

<p>
-Hey.

-Sharona, I--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<p>
Please, just let me say it.

</p>

<p>
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
-Is it like a Jesus thing?

-No, it's not that. I told you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<p>
I'm just confused, is all.

Because I thought you liked me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<p>
I do, but I was very clear

there are certain things

that I'm not interested in.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:30" />

<p>
[man] So, why did you go out with me

in the first place?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:32" />

<p>
-Because I like you! But it's complicated.

-And you're sure it's not a Jesus thing?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<p>
Fine, if it helps end this conversation,

yes, it's a Jesus thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<p>
Hey, I admire your devotion.
