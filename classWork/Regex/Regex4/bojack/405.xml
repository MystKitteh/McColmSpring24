Oh, no. No, no.

No, no, no, no, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<line>
Sorry to interrupt your lunch,

but there was another mass shooting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
Oh, God, where?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<line>
A town outside Tampa called--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:24" />

<line>
Not geographically, dipshit.

What's the location?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:27" />

<line>
What is it, a pharmacy? A haberdashery?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
-It was a shopping mall.

-No!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:34" />

<line>
-<i>Ms. Taken</i> is coming out next month.

-I know, sir.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:37" />

<line>
The whole third act

revolves around Courtney Portnoy

shooting people in a mall.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:40" />

<line>
What are we supposed to do now,

not release the movie?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<line>
I hope it doesn't come to that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:45" />

<line>
I am sick and tired

of real-life gun violence

getting in the way of us telling stories

that glamorize gun violence.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:50" />

<line>
Why does this keep happening?

Has the whole world gone crazy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<line>
No, we've just been conditioned

by a rugged individualist culture

woven into the savage architecture

of our country itself,

birthed as it was

through violent uprising,

but perhaps popularized

in the modern imagination by stories of--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<line>
Okay, Chomsky, when I want you to talk,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<line>
I'll staple a string to your back

and then yank it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
Why not make yourself useful

and schedule a sit-down

with Courtney Portnoy's team

to talk about how we distance ourselves

from this <i>fakakte mishegoss.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:15" />

<line>
Got it.

Except for the foccacia<i> </i>Michigan part.

{\an8}<i>Sure. But when you get there,</i>

<i>you're gonna be DOA.</i>

<line>
{\an8}<i>Uh-uh. You picked the wrong shopaholic</i>

<i>to mess with.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<line>
{\an8}<i>Because this shopaholic's</i>

<line>
-I have no idea who your mother is.

-What?

</line>

<line>
I don't want to have a relationship

<line>
Okay, so why did you lie to me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:54" />

<line>
I meant everything else I said.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<line>
I'll do everything I can

to help find your mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<line>
To be honest, moms aren't all that great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<line>
{\an8}In fact, in my experience,

they're soulless succubi

Oh, my grandmother

sounds like quite a character.

<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<line>
{\an8}-Can I meet her?

-Oh, my mom?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:07" />

<line>
{\an8}No, you cannot meet my mom

because she's... dead.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:11" />

<line>
-Oh.

-Dead mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<line>
{\an8}BoJack, what happened

to the fudgesicles I bought?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:18" />

<line>
-I lied again. My mom's not dead.

-Stop lying to me!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:21" />

<line>
That was, like, 15 minutes of lie.

Plus, you don't want to meet my mom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<line>
I do. Where does she live?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<line>
Oh, this spectacular elder care facility,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:28" />

<line>
{\an8}she has her own private room

with a nice view,

<line>
{\an8}under a passive-aggressive veil

of plausible deniability.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<line>
What's this place called?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:38" />

<line>
I want to say Whispering Pines.

Whistling Pines?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<line>
Unbelievable.

{\an8}-For real this time?

-Yes. I promise.

{\an8}I am not gonna lie to you ever again.

<line>
{\an8}-[groans] That is not good.

-Okay.

<timestamp data-time="00:04:12" />

<line>
{\an8}Everybody set a Google Alert

for "mass shooting."

<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<line>
Can't keep getting caught

off guard.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<line>
This is so sad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

You always hear about mass shootings

affecting other people's movie openings,

but you never think they're gonna

affect <i>your </i>movie opening. [sobs]

{\an8}Tragedy like this

really puts things in perspective.

<line>
{\an8}Like, what are we doing

sitting in a conference room?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
{\an8}Life is short. We should have

this meeting at a water park.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:37" />

<line>
Whoa! A water park

where people have meetings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<line>
-Maybe that's the movie.

-I'm sorry, who is this schmuck?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
I'm Courtney's asexual fake fianc√©.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<line>
He's a common person/supermodel,

being engaged to him makes me appear

more approachable/glamorous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:49" />

<line>
Okay-slash-whatever. We still have time

to cut the mall shootout from the film.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<line>
That still leaves

the movie theater shootout,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<line>
-the shootout at the county fair, the--

-[vibrations and buzzing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<line>
We should probably lose

the movie theater shootout.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:01" />

<line>
Right. Well, we still have

the county fair shootout.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<line>
-[vibrations and buzzing]

-Oh, dear.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
-This is a sad day.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:07" />

<line>
I gotta take this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<line>
-<i>BoJack?</i>

-Hi.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<line>
-Where have you been?

<i>-Listen.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:12" />

<line>
I'm sorry.

I was an awful boyfriend to you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
I was an awful client,

and I was an awful friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:17" />

<line>
This last year I spent some time away

and it made me realize

how special the people in my life are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:23" />

<line>
<i>And you might be</i>

<i>the most special of them all.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<line>
Wow, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<line>
[chuckles]

I-- I appreciate that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:28" />

<line>
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,

do you remember the name

of that super nice elder care facility

that we both agreed was the best place

for my mom to run out the clock?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:38" />

<line>
Oh, pluck a duck.

It's called Walnut Springs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<line>
Walnut Springs!

I knew there was a W in there. Bye!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<line>

-[ringing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<line>
What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
I feel like I didn't strike the right tone

in the last phone call.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:48" />

<line>
I really am sorry,

and the most important thing is,

you know how dedicated I am

to making things right again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
Okay. Thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<line>
Anyway, the real reason I'm calling is,

turns out there's a few Walnut Springses

in the SoCal area.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:58" />

<line>
It's the one in Santa Barbara, dummy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<line>
-Yeesh! Cranky much? Who died?

-A lotta people!

Courtney's beloved was outlining his plan

to curtail gun violence.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
I'm just saying,

if people have the right pumped-up kicks,

maybe they can outrun the bullets.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:16" />

<line>
All this talk of gun violence

is depressing.

<line>
<i>-Ms. Taken </i>is a movie about empowerment.

-That's what I've been saying!

<line>
It's <i>Bridget Jones</i>

with slightly more bloody murdering.

</line>

<line>
We just have to keep the story

on Courtney,

and not on the depressingly

unstoppable rise

of real-life gun violence in this country,

Oh... [gasps]

You're telling me

you didn't feel one twinge of guilt

when you left your mom in this place?

<timestamp data-time="00:07:37" />

<line>
Uh... twinge of guilt, twinge of guilt,

trying to remember, no.

-Definitely not.

as in every other endeavor you pursue.

-If you're looking to get knocked around

for an afternoon, why don't you just read

one of your father's manuscripts

<line>
Oh, uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<line>
-Hi, Mom.

-Do I know you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:13" />

<line>
Here we go.

Yes, Mom, I never visit. You got me.

<line>
-Henrietta?

-Okay, we're doing this?

</line>

<line>
I think she really doesn't know

who you are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:20" />

<line>
She knows.

This is just like when she pretended

not to recognize me

after my shaky choir solo in eighth grade.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<line>
I had to get a ride home with the pianist

who liked to tickle a lot more

than just the ivories.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:30" />

<line>
When I made it home unscathed, she said,

"Huh. I guess no one wants you."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:33" />

<line>
Henrietta, could I trouble you

for some orange juice, please?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<line>
Stop calling me Henrietta!

Nobody here's named Henrietta!

<line>
Henrietta, orange juice. Now!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:41" />

<line>

for polite conversation.

</line>

She learned to read on secondhand books.

I'd love a glass too.

<line>
Oh. Uh, okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:04" />

<line>
So you see

I'm really quite ordinary and relatable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:07" />

<line>
Yeah, you put your pants on

one leg at a time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:09" />

<line>
Well, I step into my pants

one leg at a time,

then my trouser-maidens lift the legs

simultaneously to avoid wrinklage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<line>
Well, right, of course,

why else have trouser-maidens?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<line>
-Hey.<i> Konichiwa, </i>Princess Mulan.

-Just leave us alone, okay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<line>
I was giving you a compliment.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:24" />

<line>
First, <i>konichiwa </i>is not a compliment,

it's Japanese for hello.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:27" />

<line>
Second, I'm not Japanese.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:28" />

<line>
Maybe I could put something

in that sweet mouth of yours

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:30" />

<line>
-so you don't have to talk so much.

-Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
One more step, asshole.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:34" />

<line>
-What...

-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:36" />

<line>
I was joking.

I don't want any trouble.

<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
-Tell your story walking.

-...the...

shit was that?

</line>

<line>
I don't know! My instincts just kicked in.

Well, using it in the movie

was so empowering,

and now I just carry it everywhere.

Do you want to hold it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:52" />

<line>
No, I am very anti-gun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<line>
In fact, I think the whole idea of guns

is inherently--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:57" />

<line>
Holy shit, I'm holding a gun.

How long has this been in my hand?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<line>
-Slides right in, doesn't it?

-It actually feels kind of nice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
Would you like to try shooting it?

We can go to my gun range.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<line>
You have your own gun range?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
I'm Courtney Portnoy.

I have all the things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:13" />

<line>
[clicking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<line>
[breathless gasp] Whoa...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<line>
[Bea] I can't believe you came back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<line>
-Who, me? Or BoJack?

-You look just like him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<line>
-People tell me that.

-[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
Your mother's dementia

is progressing rapidly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<line>
-You came out of nowhere.

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<line>
I snuck up on you on purpose as a symbol

for the alarming creep of dementia.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<line>
-It isn't there, until it is.

-Thank you, very colorful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:46" />

<line>
We tried to call you,

but the number you gave us

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
-connected to a sandwich shop in Temecula.

-Is that right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<line>
This is the most responsive

she's been in weeks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<line>
I think with regular visits

from you and your daughter--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
That's not happening.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<line>
Seeing my mom

is like a Terrence Malick movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:00" />

<line>
Every ten years or so is bearable,

but more than that

and it starts to get annoying.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<line>
She won't last another ten years.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<line>
-Well, I guess that's it, then. Bye, Mom!

-Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:08" />

<line>
Come on, Hollyhock,

let's blow this Jell-O stand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<line>
We're gonna come back though, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<line>
We can't just leave her like this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<line>
You can do anything

if you believe in yourself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<line>
-We have to come back.

-[Bea] Henrietta?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:17" />

<line>
-Every week.

-Why?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<line>
Because she's your mother

and dementia is hereditary.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:21" />

<line>
One day, you're gonna be

in a home like this, and so will I,

and wouldn't you want

someone visiting you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<line>
[groans] Fine.

We'll come back. Happy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>

Ahhh!

<line>
[humming]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
-Hey, are we out of milk?

-I can pick up some after work.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:47" />

<line>
Great. Also, real quick follow-up,

why are you holding a gun?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:51" />

<line>
Oh, my God!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:52" />

<line>
Did I drive all the way home

without realizing I was holding a gun?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:55" />

<line>
No wonder that guy at the gas station

didn't charge me for the Red Vines.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:59" />

<line>
[gasps] Did I rob a gas station?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<line>
Classic Diane shenanigans.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
Or as I call them, "Diane-igans."

All right, be safe.

Oh, here I am. There's Polio Larry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:58" />

Yup, she sure remembers

all the important people.

<line>
-[Hollyhock] And who's this?

-[Bea] That's my brother, Crackerjack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<line>
That's not Crackerjack, that's me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
Thirty seconds

after that picture was taken

you yelled at me

for getting ice cream on my shorts.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
No ice cream for me, Henrietta.

I'm watching my figure.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
Yeah, you want to look pretty

for when Death comes to visit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<line>
Beth? No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:15" />

<line>
We stopped talking

after she wouldn't eat my casserole

and then I told the whole supper club

that her son was a gay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<line>
-Ooh.

-Okay. You two enjoy each other.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<line>
I'm gonna go see

if I can seduce a lonely dowager

into giving me her night-night pills.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:27" />

<line>
Wow. Is this you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<line>
-[Bea] This is me at my debutante ball.

-You were so beautiful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<line>
You could be thin, too.

Just go easy on the sweets

and when you go somewhere,

don't walk, gallop.

Ice cold, Grammy-gram.

<line>
{\an8}And I'm A Billy Bush Type.

<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<line>
Here's something

I'm just now reading on a cue card.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:50" />

<line>
All the ladies

are getting concealed carry permits.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:53" />

<line>
It's the newest thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<line>
I wouldn't want to be around

one of those ladies

at a certain time of the month,

if you know what I mean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<line>
[laughs] I don't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:01" />

<line>
Joking aside, I think it's great

these gals have a hobby.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:04" />

<line>
Oh, and I'm being told by our producers

that we have a breaking news alert--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<line>
-there has been another mass shooting.

-[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:11" />

<line>
I am totally unqualified

to cover a news story this important.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:14" />

<line>
But as a straight white male,

I will plow forward with confidence

and assume I'm doing fine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<line>
[groans] Again with the crazy gunmen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:24" />

<line>
Princess Carolyn, if this keeps up,

we're gonna have to put this movie

on the shelf

next to that wacky vacation comedy we did

about the klutzy babysitter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<line>
-[Todd] <i>Ha! That sounds hilarious!</i>

-What the hell are you doing on this call?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<line>
Imagining that funny movie

you just described.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:37" />

<line>
Okay, what do all these shootings

have in common?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
Guns? Bullets? Who are you,

Art Linkletter? Just spit it out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:41" />

<line>
Men! What if we played up

the "Ms." in <i>Ms. Taken</i>?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:45" />

<line>
In a world of increasing terror,

our movie tells women

they don't have to be afraid anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:50" />

<line>
-Yeah, now you're talking.

-When you put it that way,

it almost sounds like these mass shootings

could be a good thing for the movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<line>
No, no, no, of course not.

They're a terrible tragedy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<line>
Thoughts and prayers

are with the victims.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:01" />

<line>
-Right, thoughts and prayers.

-But...

anything that makes women feel unsafe

might actually help our box office.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<line>
But you don't want women to feel unsafe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:10" />

<line>
Of course not!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
Nobody wants that,

nobody's saying that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<line>
But if they already <i>do</i> feel unsafe,

there's no reason not to capitalize.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<line>
Right, if they already feel unsafe anyway.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:19" />

<line>
Exactly, we're not making them

feel unsafe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<line>
We're just profiting, albeit indirectly,

from there being more mass shootings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:26" />

<line>
[cell phone vibrates]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:28" />

<line>
In that case,

I got good news and I got bad news.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<line>
Bad news is

you're gonna want to avoid the 405.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<line>
-Ta-da!

-Ugh! Keep it down.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:37" />

<line>
Why are you carrying that thin hard book?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:39" />

<line>
It's not a book, it's a DVD case.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:40" />

<line>
We did a special episode about elder care.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<line>
Now we're gonna watch it

and learn how to handle this bitch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:45" />

<line>
When you say "this bitch",

do you mean your mom's dementia

or your mom?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:49" />

<line>
I think you can pick that up

through context.

</line>

That's my son on the television.

-You know I hate guns, right?

-I know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:37" />

<line>
Although my official stated

political opinion

is I respect the Second Amendment

but I think some gun purchases

should require the barest amount 

of background checks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

you know I hate guns, too.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:48" />

<line>
Or I thought I did. Or I still do, mostly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<line>
But being a gun owner finally makes me

feel as safe walking down the street

as a man gets to feel all the time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:56" />

<line>
And that's an incredible feeling

I'm not ready to give up yet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<line>
If you can frack under our house,

I should get to have a gun.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<line>
All right, that's fair.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />

<line>
I'm really proud we've found a way

to keep our personal lives

and our political lives compartmentalized.

<line>
Which dumb show? New one or old one?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<line>
In the episode I saw, you walked in

on your daughter in the shower.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<line>
The old one. That episode got us

into the <i>TV Guide</i>

"Cheers and Jeers" column.

<line>
We did not get a "Cheers."

Out of the way, hag,

you're blocking the screen.

<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<line>
Uh-huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
I know this must be painful for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:50" />

<line>
Not painful, boring. This place sucks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:53" />

<line>
If I'm not getting credit

for coming, what's the point?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<line>
If only there was some way for her

to connect the BoJack from the show

with the BoJack who visits her every week.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<line>
-Yeah, too bad we can't. Or can we?

-Can we what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<line>
Put on a live episode

of <i>Horsin' Around </i>in the nursing home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:08" />

<line>
-Good thinking, Hollyhock.

-Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:10" />

<line>
We'll do a <i>Horsin' Around</i>

here at the home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<line>
She'll love it

because it's her son BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<line>
-Okay...

-Then after the show,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:15" />

<line>
I'll come out and say hello.

And she'll say, "BoJack? Is that you?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<line>
When her eyes spark with recognition,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:21" />

<line>
I'm gonna sit down next to her,

I'm gonna squeeze her hand

and get real close and say...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<line>
-"Fuck you, Mom."

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:28" />

<line>
I can finally tell her off!

I'm gonna say, "Look at you,

you old piece of shit,

rotting in a nursing home!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<line>
-Now I have the power!

-That's what you want to say to her?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<line>
Oh, it's gonna be great!

I can't wait to see the look on her face.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<line>
Okay, let's do this. Let's put on a show!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:46" />

<line>
[ringing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<line>
-Hey!

-Bad news.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
Hear about the mass shooting

outside Tulsa?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<line>
Terrible tragedy.

Thoughts and prayers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
We really have to do something

about these men who go...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<line>
No, P.C. This time it was a woman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:57" />

<line>
A woman mass shooter?

Oh, no, that really <i>is </i>bad news!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:01" />

<line>
{\an8}I just think this is what happens

when you give women guns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<line>
{\an8}They start shooting people with them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:06" />

<line>
{\an8}I mean, do they even know

what guns are for?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<line>
{\an8}I don't feel safe anymore

walking down my own street alone at night.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:11" />

<line>
{\an8}Me, a man!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<line>
{\an8}I am convening a series

of congressional hearings

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:15" />

<line>
{\an8}on the matter of women and guns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:17" />

<line>
{\an8}Because even one death

from the bullet of a female gun owner

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
{\an8}is too many.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
{\an8}What are my constituents supposed to do,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:24" />

<line>
{\an8}not compliment

random women on the street

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
{\an8}because they might be

carrying a gun?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:29" />

<line>
{\an8}We cannot allow our lives

to be dictated by that kind of fear.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<line>
{\an8}So you see, the trigger was specifically

designed for a man's grip

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<line>
{\an8}and a man's temperament.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<line>
{\an8}Look, all I'm saying is

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:41" />

<line>
{\an8}maybe you shouldn't blame women

for wanting guns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<line>
{\an8}Maybe you should blame

the constant societal messaging

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
{\an8}that tells us we are safe only as long

as the men around us allow us to be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<line>
{\an8}So if you have a problem

with women carrying firearms,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
{\an8}you can roll up your sleeves

and actually work to create a society

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<line>
{\an8}where women feel safe and equal,

or you can just ban all guns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<line>
-[gavel banging]

-The ayes have it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<line>
Possession of any firearm is now illegal

in the state of California.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:11" />

<line>
We did it, boys.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:12" />

-Yes!

-Fabulous!

I thought that was gonna go the other way.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
Wow, Diane.

You just passed sensible gun legislation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:22" />

<line>
I can't believe this country hates women

more than it loves guns.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:25" />

<line>
No?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:30" />

<line>
BoJack, I don't know about this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:32" />

<line>
You'll be fine.

Just remember to enunciate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<line>
It helps if you imagine

performing for the back row.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:36" />

Henrietta, what are you doing?

<timestamp data-time="00:22:02" />

<line>
BoJack, maybe we should stop.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<line>
We just started. Let's at least

get through the first act

before we judge ourselves

too harshly, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<line>
I wonder if there's a way

to make math fun.

-[Hollyhock] Math will never be fun.

<line>
I never get to watch what I want.

<line>
You think we should

still finish the episode, or...?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
Our insurance policy

is very strict and very clear.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<line>
Once a resident becomes violent,

we can no longer house them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<line>
Can you recommend another facility?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<line>
Frankly, at your mother's rate

of deterioration,

she probably doesn't have much time.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<line>
I recommend she spend it surrounded

by the people who care about her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<line>
Okay, who are they?

Do you have their number?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<line>
-I was referring to you and your daughter.

-Oh. Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<line>
We'll take her.

She can have the guest room,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<line>
-and I can sleep on the couch. Right?

-[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:15" />

<line>
Okay. If she really doesn't have

much time left.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<line>
But if we get to this time next year,

she's still hanging on,

you will be getting

a very strongly worded letter, mister.

Maybe it could work

as an H&amp;M commercial?

It's a shame. It was a great movie.

I could make Pop-Tarts.

[Bea] No, thank you.

You want to watch

another <i>Horsin' Around</i> episode?

</line>

<line>
I'm sorry you didn't get

to tell your mom off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<line>
I keep thinking

about all the things I never said

because I was so sure

there'd be other days to say them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:13" />

<line>
-Why don't you tell her now?

-It's not the same.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<line>
I should have done it

back when she knew who I was,

back when it would mean something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:19" />

<line>
But now, she's gonna die

and she's never gonna know

just how much I hate her.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:22" />

<line>
I'm sure she knew, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:25" />

<line>
-Yeah? You're not just saying that?

-She read your book, didn't she?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
[sighs] Yeah, but I really wanted

to say it to her face.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<line>
Well, hey, she's here now, right?

And she has good days and bad days.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:36" />

<line>
Maybe, eventually, she'll recognize you.

And then you can totally rip into her.

</line>
