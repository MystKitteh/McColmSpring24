<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<line>
So, at the end of the day,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:12" />

<line>
I'm just a regular guy trying

to live a regular life.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
Remember that time you peed

in Drew Barrymore's car?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:18" />

<line>
Uh, yes, I remember that.

Why do you remember that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:21" />

<line>
It was in your book.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<line>
-You should do that to someone here.

-What? No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<line>
Well, anyway, I can't believe

I'm on a date with BoJack Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
I feel like that anonymous girl

from Chapter 8 of your book

mixed with the pluck and determination

of that anonymous girl

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<line>
-from Chapter 12.

-We don't need to dwell on the past.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<line>
Wait, shut up.

Is this the restaurant you bought

when you were trying

to show up Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<line>
-Uh... No.

-Hey, this table's a little wobbly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<line>
Want to yell at the waiter

and make a scene?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
-No, I don't need--

-Come on, do that BoJack thing

where you make a big deal

and everyone laughs,

but at the same time we relate,

because you're saying

the things polite society won't.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<line>
That's not-- Ugh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:59" />

<line>
-Is everything all right over here?

-No, everything is not all right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<line>
This table's been wobbling all evening.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<line>
If I wanted to flop around and get seasick

for an hour, I'd call your mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:09" />

<line>
-Something in that area or...?

-Take me home now

and don't let me get out of bed

until I turn horse-colored.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<line>
-What are you doing?

-Did you want me to stay?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:19" />

<line>
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<line>
Some of us here are trying

to forget you exist.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<line>
"Forget you exist."

Classic BoJack. Love it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<line>
[BoJack sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:27" />

<line>
[Claire] Oh, my God, are you Todd?

[Todd] Uh, yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:30" />

<line>
[Claire] "Shut up, Todd!"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<line>
[Claire laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:33" />

<line>
[Todd] Aw, okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:36" />

<line>
{\an8}[♪♪]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<line>
Hey, Todd, can you drive me

to get my car?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:35" />

<line>
{\an8}I wanted to be responsible last night,

so I Ubered home

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:38" />

<line>
-and left my car in the fountain.

-Sorry, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<line>
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.

It's finally happening. My Disneyland.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:46" />

<line>
{\an8}I realize that by saying "what"

I might set off a chain of events

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:49" />

<line>
{\an8}whereby we continue this conversation,

but what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:52" />

<line>
{\an8}Well, remember when I first moved in

and I kept asking

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<line>
{\an8}-if we could go to Disneyland?

-I do not.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<line>
{\an8}And then you said

that there was no Disneyland.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:59" />

<line>
{\an8}-No.

-That Disneyland was a made-up lie,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:02" />

<line>
{\an8}like the tooth fairy, that parents use

to get their kids to behave.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:06" />

<line>
{\an8}-Oh, yeah, that shut you up.

-Sure did.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:08" />

<line>
{\an8}But then I thought,

why isn't there a Disneyland?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:12" />

<line>
{\an8}People would love it!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:13" />

<line>
{\an8}So, I took matters into my own hands,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:16" />

<line>
{\an8}and over the last five years,

I built my own Disneyland.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<line>
{\an8}You've been doing this for five years?

How have you never mentioned it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:23" />

<line>
{\an8}I bought that cheap plot of non-arable

dirt by the toxic waste dump

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:27" />

<line>
{\an8}-up the hill from the old fire station.

-Okay, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:30" />

<line>
{\an8}-I'm gonna build a Disneyland.

-Sounds great, champ.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<line>
{\an8}If it wasn't for that,

she never would've gotten sober.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:36" />

<line>
{\an8}Just finished drawing up blueprints

for that Disneyland I'm building.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<line>
{\an8}Kind of busy here, Todd.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<line>
{\an8}So, it turned out to be a good thing

I peed in her car.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<line>
{\an8}Sorry for all the noise.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:45" />

<line>
{\an8}Got this crew of worker bees

to help me build my Disneyland.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:49" />

<line>
{\an8}Okay, I get it. You are building

your own Disneyland.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:53" />

<line>
{\an8}-Literally the first I'm hearing of this.

-Anyway, tomorrow we open the gates.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:57" />

<line>
{\an8}Finally, people will have a place to go

after they win the Super Bowl.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:02" />

<line>
{\an8}But you do know

that there already is a Disneyland?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
{\an8}-Yeah, I built it.

-No, I mean the real Disneyland.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<line>
{\an8}You mean, the one in the hearts

and minds of children everywhere?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<line>
{\an8}-The one in Anaheim!

-I think we're saying the same thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
Are we?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<line>
Well, I think it's safe

to take the cone off.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:20" />

<line>
I can do it for a small co-pay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:23" />

<line>
Can't say I'll miss it,

but we did have some crazy adventures

together these last few weeks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:30" />

<line>
Honey, would you rub my chin for me

so I can remember things?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:34" />

<line>
Oh, um, okay. Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:36" />

<line>
Yeah, memories.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<line>
Hey, where should we go for my first meal

after the operation?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:42" />

<line>
It's not an operation,

but we could go to Storky's again.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<line>
Oh, yeah! We're finally due

for our free sub.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
"Storky's,

where your 81st sandwich is free."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:51" />

<line>
We've been there 80 times?

It just opened last month.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<line>
Yeah, but you love it, so whenever

you suggest it, I always say yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:58" />

<line>
Yeah, but 80 times?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:02" />

<line>
Well, that'll be $6000.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:05" />

<line>
Good thing you're getting

a free sandwich, huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
What the...?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
Huh?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
Okay, you guys. [yells]

You vultures are killing me!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:20" />

<line>
I'm sure he's talking about

other vultures.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<line>
Ah, the Valley.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<line>
Because sometimes you wanna go

where no one knows your name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<line>
-[Pinky] BoJack Horseman!

-Pinky? Hey, how are you?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
[stammers]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<line>
Oh, great!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
-How's the book biz?

-Who knows?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:39" />

<line>
I jumped off that burning ship.

Print media? What a joke.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<line>
Now I got a job

in broadcast network television,

a booming industry

with nowhere to go but up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
Oh, God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:52" />

<line>
-What are you doing here?

-Oh, my boss loves this place.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<line>
Do you know Wanda Pierce?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<line>
Wanda just got named head

of programming at MBN.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:00" />

<line>
We're here to celebrate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
Well, that and she just woke up

from a 30-year coma.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:04" />

<line>
Wait, she just got out

of a 30-year coma

and she's the head of programming

at a major broadcast network?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:10" />

<line>
She's been with the company 30 years.

Everyone above her kept getting fired.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:14" />

<line>
Besides, she's got

some really fresh ideas.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<line>
I am really feeling

<i>The Kirk Cameron Show.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:20" />

<line>
I don't even need a pilot.

Let's just order 22 episodes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:24" />

<line>
How about a new show

where celebrities try to guess

whether or not people have talent?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<line>
We'll air it three nights a week.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:31" />

<line>
[all gasp]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
Okay, what if we got relevant superstar

David Copperfield

to make

the World Trade Center disappear?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:40" />

<line>
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

but David Copperfield really isn't

a big draw anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<line>
Actually, everything feels fresh

if you just forget

the last 30 years ever happened.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:51" />

<line>
Huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:52" />

<line>
[woman over PA]

<i>And here's a special request.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:54" />

<line>
<i>I've never even heard of this song,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<line>
<i>but let's give it a spin:</i>

<i>"Special Feeling."</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:59" />

<line>
Wanda, meet

the one and only BoJack Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<line>
-Who?

-BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<line>
-Who?

-BoJack Horseman.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
Is that name supposed

to mean something to me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:08" />

<line>
[light rock ballad playing over speakers]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
-Do you want to go skate?

-Nah. You know what they say,

you can lead a horse to roller,

but you can't make him rink.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<line>
[laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:21" />

<line>
-What?

-That's really funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<line>
-You're funny.

-Really?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:25" />

<line>
Oh, my God. You should be on TV,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:27" />

<line>
[gasps]

which, holy shit, they're flat now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<line>
Actually, I was on. You know what,

I'm sick of talking about me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:33" />

<line>
Let's talk about you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:41" />

<line>
[Wanda] Next thing I know,

I'm waking up from a 30-year coma.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:44" />

<line>
So, now I'm sleeping on my sister's couch,

but it's not ideal.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<line>
She's molting.

You know how sisters are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<line>
Oh, jeez, got a couple curly guys in here

with the regulars.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:53" />

<line>
How hard is it to look

before they bring it out?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:56" />

<line>
-Excuse me, miss?

-I know, isn't it cool?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<line>
-Like we're getting away with something.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<line>
Don't you love it when appetizers have

a little crossover episode?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<line>
It's like when you're watching

<i>Happy Days </i>and Mork shows up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:07" />

<line>
Oh, yeah, I guess.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<line>
Or like when Kramer was

on <i>Murphy Brown</i>.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<line>
-Who?

-Hey, you want to get out of here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:17" />

<line>
I don't want MBN to just be another boring

old network, you know what I mean?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:22" />

<line>
-Yes, totally.

-I want to take risks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:24" />

<line>
I want to swing for the fences, you know?

Otherwise, what are we doing?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:28" />

<line>
Oh, my God, is it morning?

We stayed up all night talking,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:31" />

<line>
-and we didn't even have sex.

-Well, it's not too late.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<line>
Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:40" />

<line>
-That was fantastic.

-Oh, yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:43" />

<line>
Of course, I haven't had sex in 30 years.

I hope.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:46" />

<line>
-Something's wrong.

-What is it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<line>
I don't know, I feel weird, like I want

to spend more time with you

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<line>
-even though I know we just had sex.

-Oh, okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:54" />

<line>
No, you don't understand.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:55" />

<line>
We already had sex,

but I still want to spend time with you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<line>
Is that normal? Am I normal?

What is happening to me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<line>
We can spend more time together.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:05" />

<line>
I want to do things with you.

Fully clothed, sober, in daylight hours.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<line>
-Okay.

-I don't understand these feelings.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<line>
Let's get food? Or walk in park? Or--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:16" />

<line>
Oh, God, it's coming. I can't stop it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:19" />

<line>
-Do you want to go to Disneyland?

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<line>
[carnival music playing over speakers]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:31" />

<line>
[child crying]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:33" />

<line>
Disneyland has a lot more sparking wires

and loose nails than I remember.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:37" />

<line>
Please hold your questions

until the end of the tour.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:40" />

<line>
Here we have

Mr. Todd's Wild Death-Coaster.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:45" />

<line>
The name is a work in progress,

but we wanted to work "death"

into the title for liability reasons.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:50" />

<line>
And this is Gabe Jr.,

the Grease Fire of the Caribbean.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:55" />

<line>
-This is boring. I want to go home.

-Vincent, be nice!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:00" />

<line>
He's a little cranky

because he just got adult braces.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
-You mean, braces.

-Princess Carolyn, stop embarrassing me!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<line>
Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:08" />

<line>
And here we have Cinderella's

magical pile of used mattresses.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<line>
[child] Help!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<line>
Is it a good idea

to keep all those mattresses

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:17" />

<line>
-so close to an active grease fire?

-Where's your sense of wonder, Diane?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<line>
-Your friend is really negative.

-Yeah, don't be so negative, Diane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:25" />

<line>
-What?

-You know I hate negativity.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:27" />

<line>
I mean, I don't hate it because

that's also negative, but you know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<line>
[quacks, then yells]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<line>
[children laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<line>
-Hey, Mr. Peanutbutter.

-Hey, buddy. This place is amazing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:39" />

<line>
It's like some sort of Disney version

of Knott's Berry Farm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:42" />

<line>
Oh, that's exactly

what I was going for!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<line>
I can't wait to get involved

and really spray the old

Mr. Peanutbutter scent on everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:49" />

<line>
Uh, I was sort of thinking of this

as kind of just my thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:55" />

<line>
Well, technically, you did build this

while working for P.B. Livin,

so I have the blah-blah-blah

of first refusal or whatever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:03" />

<line>
Oh, uh, okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<line>
I mean, that's just good business.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:06" />

<line>
We're in this together now, Todd,

and nothing will distract me from--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:10" />

<line>
Erica! You can't be here.

This place is filled with children.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<line>
Coach said he saw you headed

to the visitor's locker room

with a steel pipe.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<line>
You really think I'm the guy

who busted that pinto's leg?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:23" />

<line>
'Cause if I am, you should be

a lot more goddamn scared of me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:27" />

<line>
Hey! My girlfriend's here.

Look, everyone! I have a girlfriend!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
Sure. We'll cut there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
The middle of your line

is as good a place as any.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
-What are you doing here?

-Just wanted to stop by.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<line>
We're filming <i>Hey, I Think</i>

<i>You Can Dance! </i>next door.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
Look at you, all professional.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:43" />

<line>
Like Natalie Portman in that movie

where she was a professional.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:46" />

<line>
Who? [giggles]

People are watching.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:48" />

<line>
Ugh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:49" />

<line>
The first time BoJack dates a woman

his own age,

she's basically just

a stunted 20-year-old.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:54" />

<line>
Well, BoJack's stunted, too.

He got famous in his twenties,

so he'll be

in his twenties forever.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<line>
After you get famous, you stop growing,

you don't have to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<line>
Every celebrity has

an age of stagnation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:04" />

<line>
I'm glad I never got famous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:05" />

<line>
I mean, I did write a best-selling book,

but I'm not famous-famous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:08" />

<line>
It doesn't just happen

when you get famous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:10" />

<line>
Your age of stagnation

is when you stop growing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
For most, it's when they get married,

settle into a routine.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:16" />

<line>
You meet someone

who loves you unconditionally

and never challenges you

or wants you to change,

and then you never change.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:23" />

<line>
But mostly it's just the famous people,

right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:29" />

<line>
Stella! Stella!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:32" />

<line>
Corona Light.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<line>
This place is incredible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:36" />

<line>
I wanted to make you feel at home,

and nothing was bigger in the '80s

than '50s nostalgia.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:42" />

<line>
It really feels like I'm back in the '80s,

feeling like I'm back in the '50s.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:46" />

<line>
It's like if <i>Back to the Future</i>

and <i>Peggy Sue Got Married </i>got married.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:49" />

<line>
[man over radio]

<i>Okay, teenyboppers,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:51" />

<line>
<i>let's take things back</i>

<i>to the '50s, '50s style,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
<i>with this classic '50s hit</i>

</line>

<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<line>
Wanda, these last few days

have been so amazing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:12" />

<line>
You've given me a fresh start.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<line>
In fact, it almost feels like

I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:17" />

<line>
I'm sorry, did you say you just woke up

from a 30-year coma?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<line>
-Oh, no, not me. Her.

-That's insane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<line>
I just woke up from a 30-year coma.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<line>
[record stops]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:26" />

<line>
<i>Whoa!</i>

<i>Sorry about that needle skip, folks.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<line>
<i>Let's start that song again</i>

<i>from the beginning.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:32" />

<line>
[do-wop ballad plays over speakers]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:39" />

<line>
I'm Alex.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<line>
-Wanda.

-And I'm BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<line>
It's been really tough for me

these last few weeks.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:45" />

<line>
I've never seen <i>Home Alone </i>and everyone

makes me feel like a freak because of it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:48" />

<line>
-You've never seen <i>Home Alone?</i>

-I've never seen it!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<line>
-Also, I don't really know what a DVR is.

-Neither do I!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<line>
-No one does. It's just a magic box.

-Wanda, we have so much in common.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:59" />

<line>
Really it's just one thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<line>
You can't count each individual thing

as a different thing.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:03" />

<line>
That's like saying I have a lot

in common with Kanye West

because we both breathe air.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:08" />

<line>
[both]

Who? Jinx. Buy me a Coke Zero.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<line>
What's a Coke Zero?

I have no idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:12" />

<line>
[both laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<line>
We gotta hang out more. I didn't know

there was anyone else like me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<line>
Give me your fax and pager number

so I can add them to my Rolodex.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:20" />

<line>
Tubular.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:21" />

<line>
[BoJack sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:23" />

<line>
I don't trust that guy.

I bet he's seen <i>Home Alone.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:27" />

<line>
BoJack, I'm starting to lose

the thread of your character.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:30" />

<line>
You think you can drop the jealous

boyfriend routine? It feels a little done.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:34" />

<line>
You're right, I'm sorry.

Call me Snoop Dogg

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<line>
-because I will drop it like it's hot.

-BoJack, I don't--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:39" />

<line>
I got that one! Snoopy the dog.

From "Peanuts." Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:49" />

<line>
I got here as fast as I could.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<line>
Where's this next Haley Joel Osment?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:54" />

<line>
-That was a lie to get you here.

-Aw, fish.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<line>
-There's never a next Haley Joel Osment.

-And there never will be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:59" />

<line>
Sorry I tricked you, but with Todd

running his own Disneyland

and actress Margo Martindale

in prison

for some reason I don't remember,

you're the best friend I've got.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<line>
Now grab the binoculars. I need dirt

on Wanda's new gentleman friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
No, BoJack. What's the play here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<line>
You'll find one little imperfection

and harp on it

like you do with my boyfriend?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<line>
You do understand what my "thing" is

with your boyfriend?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:20" />

<line>
You'll just push her

into this other guy's arms.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:22" />

<line>
Wanda likes you. Why ruin that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
<i>This is Comrade Alexander</i>

<i>calling KGB High Command.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:30" />

<line>
It's been two weeks since I woke up,

and I still have not been contacted

by my handlers.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:35" />

<line>
I am awaiting orders to take down

the American dogs and pigs

and other various animals and humans.

Come in, KGB High Command.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:42" />

<line>
Slap my salami, the guy's a commie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:50" />

<line>
Hey, what's going on here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:52" />

<line>
You've been served

with a cease-and-desist from my clients,

the Walt Disney Company.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:57" />

<line>
I wanted to make sure what we were

doing here was 100 percent legal,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:01" />

<line>
-so I called a lawyer.

-Wait, what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:03" />

<line>
As it turns out, it's not legal at all.

Who knew?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:06" />

<line>
-Mr. Peanutbutter.

-We'll see you in court.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:10" />

<line>
-The food court?

-No. Regular court.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<line>
Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I might

just stop by the food court first.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:20" />

<line>
{\an8}Let the record show, this is the single

dumbest case I've ever adjudicated.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<line>
-Mr. Chavez?

-Okay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:28" />

<line>
I'm just gonna throw this out there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:29" />

<line>
Is it possible maybe when the other guys

tried to copyright the name Disneyland,

they wrote down something else

by mistake,

so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<line>
Okay, well, let's have a look

at the Articles of Incorporation to see

if Walt Disney accidentally trademarked

the wrong name. I'm sure these--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<line>
[stammers]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:50" />

<line>
-What?

-There's a typo. Di-isneyland.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<line>
With two "i"s. That son of a gun

trademarked the wrong name.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:59" />

<line>
May I, counselor?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<line>
D-I-I-S.

This is unambiguous.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:04" />

<line>
-I find in favor of the defendant.

-Aw, shit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<line>
-You're the defendant.

-Aw, sweet!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:11" />

<line>
Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriage

of justice.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:15" />

<line>
Hooray! Gross miscarriage!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<line>
And that's how I turned my dream into

what I call "The Happiest Place On Urf."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:27" />

<line>
Urf is a made-up magical kingdom

I added to the Disney canon.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

<line>
-Americans, they like this theme park?

-Oh, they love it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<line>
It represents everything

America stands for.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<line>
<i>Da.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<line>
-I mean, yeah.

-We did it, buddy!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<line>
Actually, I did it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:42" />

<line>
I had the idea to build a park,

I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:49" />

<line>
-Well, there's no "i" in "team," right?

-But there is an "i" in "Disneyland."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<line>
And unlike that other Disneyland,

this Disneyland only has one "i".

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<line>
What are you saying?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:01" />

<line>
You're not welcome

at my theme park anymore.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<line>
There's only room for one goofy dog there

and his name is Pluto.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<line>
Todd, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:11" />

<line>
I've told the bees

if they see you to sting you on sight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<line>
You understand. It's nothing personal.

It's just good business.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
And that's how we do business on Urf.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<line>
-I don't like you like this.

-I learned it from you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:26" />

<line>
If I could get everyone's attention.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<line>
You're probably wondering

why I invited you all here tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:31" />

<line>
You said it was to celebrate

Todd's legal victory.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<line>
Right, but obviously,

I don't care about that,

so you're probably wondering

the real reason.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:38" />

<line>
[Princess Carolyn]

No, we just took you at face value.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:41" />

<line>
We have a special guest here tonight.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:43" />

<line>
Alex. Or should I say "comrade"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<line>
[BoJack gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:48" />

<line>
-Why would you say "comrade"?

-Oh, I forgot to explain that part.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:52" />

<line>
Alex is a KGB agent

bent on destroying America.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<line>
[all gasp]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:57" />

<line>
-It truly is a small world after all!

-Alex, is that true?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:00" />

<line>
Okay, yes. It's true.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<line>
I was a deep-cover KGB operative

before I went into my coma.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<line>
I've been trying to contact

my handler in Russia,

but I can't reach him

and I don't know if I ever will.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:12" />

<line>
[all] Aww!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
No! He's-- It's not adorable!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:16" />

<line>
He's a soviet sleeper-agent

who doesn't realize the Cold War is over.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:20" />

<line>
I felt totally alone in this world

before I met Wanda.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:23" />

<line>
And then I met all of you, my friends.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:25" />

<line>
But if you're gonna kick me to the curb

just because I think

you're all capitalist swine

and want to see your way

of life destroyed, well, so be it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<line>
-Or should I say, So-vi-et.

-Oh! Cute. Wordplay.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:38" />

<line>
-That's not even good wordplay.

-Wait, how did you know all this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:41" />

<line>
-BoJack, were you spying on him?

-He is literally a spy

trying to destroy America,

the country we all live in.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:48" />

<line>
How am I the bad guy here?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<line>
BoJack, I am really bumping on

the whole you-not-liking-Alex of it all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:54" />

<line>
-You told me you were going to drop it.

-Yeah, but--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<line>
I don't care about Alex.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<line>
I want to know what happened

to the amazing guy

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<line>
I spent the last few days with,

because if this is who you are,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<line>
I don't think I like it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<line>
Alex, would you take me back

to my sister's place?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<line>
Sure thing, Wanda.

And I can get you there fast

because I'm always Russian.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<line>
[all] Aww!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<line>
Seriously?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:18" />

<line>
[BoJack sighs]

[Princess Carolyn gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
I got here as fast as I could.

Where's the next Dakota Fa--?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<line>
Oh, I get what happened.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<line>
Could you get me a beer from the fridge?

I didn't want to stand up.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<line>
Wait, no. I don't deserve beer.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:30" />

<line>
You called me all the way over here

to not get you a beer?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:33" />

<line>
Why do I always do this?

I push away everyone I care about.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:36" />

<line>
Oh, do you? I never noticed that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:38" />

<line>
Look, you obviously really care

about this girl

and that scares you,

so you sabotage yourself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:44" />

<line>
That's my problem.

I'm too good at sabotage.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:47" />

<line>
-Why am I so good at everything I do?

-Hey, I got a crazy idea.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<line>
How about you just stop sulking

and go win her back, dummy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:54" />

<line>
You're right. I gotta win her back,

put it all on the line. You know what?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:58" />

<line>
I think I will have that beer,

can you get it for me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:01" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
-Why do I bother?

-Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:05" />

<line>
Actually, I want both beers!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<line>
-Wanda.

-What do you want, BoJack?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:16" />

<line>
There's something I gotta say.

When I was--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<line>
-Todd! There's something I gotta say!

-Hey, I'm kind of already doing--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<line>
I never should have tried

to make your thing my thing!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<line>
I just got excited and wanted to smear

Mr. Peanutbutter all over everything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<line>
I should have been supporting you,

like this support beam.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<line>
-Or a different support beam.

-It's my fault.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

The point of Disneyland isn't

to make money and win lawsuits.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<line>
But I forgot that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<line>
So, these two were so consumed

by greed that it destroyed them.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:47" />

<line>
You know, I came here today

to blow up Disneyland.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<line>
-You what?

-But now I realize,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<line>
I don't need to take down capitalism.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:53" />

<line>
Capitalism sows the seeds

for its own destruction.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
It's a snake that eats itself.

It's only a matter of time.

</line>

[whistling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:01" />

Hey, buddy, let's just say we-- Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<line>
Oh, no, no, no. No!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<line>
Gabe Jr.!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<line>
Quick, Todd! The mattress pile!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<line>
Jump to safety! No!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<line>
Bees, help!

Your queen commands you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:20" />

<line>
No! Bees! Come on!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:25" />

<line>
[groaning]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:26" />

<line>
-You gotta-- Over the--

-What is it, boy? What's wrong?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
-Hey, there's trouble.

-Did some kid fall down a well?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:34" />

<line>
No, no, no! Listen.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<line>
He's trying to tell us

a kid fell down a well.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
-Let's go, go, go! Come on!

-Bad, bad, bad. You gotta--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<line>
No, no, no, listen!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
Wait, Wanda, we need to talk.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:46" />

<line>
-But the fire.

-I don't care about that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:48" />

<line>
Look, the great guy you've been

getting to know, that's me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:51" />

<line>
That other guy,

the guy from the party,

that's me too and you need

to know that. I'm not perfect.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<line>
I'm cynical and I'm possessive

and I can sometimes fly off the handle.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:01" />

<line>
I'm not always the best

at being not terrible.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:05" />

<line>
I gotta say,

I'm not loving this pitch so far.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:07" />

<line>
But I want to be better,

I'm trying to be better.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<line>
And when I'm around you,

for the first time in 30 years,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:12" />

<line>
I feel like I can be.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<line>
Wanda, you make me want

to be a better man.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:16" />

<line>
Wow. That's a great line.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:18" />

<line>
-Did you just come up with that?

-Yes.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:21" />

<line>
Hey, boys and girls,

this is your park DJ speaking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:25" />

<line>
And as the <i>Titanic's </i>band played on

as the ship sank,

so too will I spin one last record

as my DJ booth is engulfed in flames.

<timestamp data-time="00:23:56" />

<line>
Hooray!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:04" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<line>
-You saved me!

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:07" />

<line>
I saved us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<line>
Woo-hoo!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:13" />

<line>
-I want to give this a real shot.

-I don't know, BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:16" />

<line>
I just got out of my coma,

and I don't have time to waste

if you're still figuring your shit out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<line>
Plus, it's hard to think straight

with this fire everywhere.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:24" />

<line>
-Move in with me.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<line>
I know it feels fast.

We barely know each other.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
It's crazy, but I like you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<line>
And sometimes you gotta swing

for the fences, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:34" />

<line>
-Okay.

-Yeah?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:36" />

<line>
Yeah. Let's move in together.

Let's do it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:39" />

<line>
It's crazy, but let's do it!
