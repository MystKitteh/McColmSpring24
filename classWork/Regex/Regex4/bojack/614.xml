-[men laughing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:08" />

<p>
And that's the end of a sexist,

fatphobic anecdote

in which I was so desperate

to get out of the rain,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:14" />

<p>
-I slept with a plus-sized woman.

-[laughter continues]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:17" />

<p>
[woman] Hold the door.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<p>
-Oh! Did I miss a meeting?

-No, Angela.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:22" />

<p>
We took Davey here out

for a big '90s-style birthday party,

it being the '90s and all...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<p>
I would have come!

I love the '90s, and it being them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:30" />

<p>
Come on, the president of the network

shouldn't fraternize with the board.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:33" />

<p>
Let your number two handle that stuff.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:36" />

<p>
-[elevator dings]

-[laughter continues]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:38" />

<p>
I don't like you going to birthday parties

behind my back, Teddy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:41" />

<p>
I was doing reconnaissance for you!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<p>
You didn't hear it from me,

but there's some concern

that as a single career gal, you're,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<p>
-well, a single career gal.

-And?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<p>
ABC's supposed to be

a family network.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:52" />

<p>
I understand families.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<p>
Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:55" />

<p>
Does he?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<p>
Oh, Herb. [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:02" />

<p>
[Herb] I'm sorry, okay?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:03" />

<p>
It's called discretion, Herb.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:05" />

<p>
We're trying to sell

the network to Disney.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<p>
Disney? You think Michael Eisner

gives a hoot who I go to bed with?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<p>
We don't need to bring Eisner into this.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:12" />

<p>
Obviously,

Michael Eisner is a compassionate

and progressive individual.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<p>
This isn't about him.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<p>
-So, it's you. Just say it's you.

-No. You're the one--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:20" />

<p>
If you're going to fire me,

at least have the balls to fire me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:23" />

<p>
-You're fired.

-Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<p>
You think you can do

"Horsin' Around" without me?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:26" />

<p>
We could do it without anybody.

All we need is the horse.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:29" />

<p>
And that horse is just gonna go along

with you canning his best friend?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<p>
You want BoJack to betray me,

you're gonna need one hell of a pitch.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:37" />

<p>
Okay.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:38" />

<p>
[theme music playing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:36" />

<p>
-[inhales, sighs]

-[knocking on door]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:39" />

<p>
{\an8}-Mr. Horseman, you're invited to set?

-Thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:42" />

<p>
{\an8}-The set of "Horny Unicorn"?

-Yes, I'm aware.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:44" />

<p>
To shoot a scene

in which the titular horny unicorn

gets his penis stuck in a saxophone,

because he was hoping to "get blown"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:50" />

<p>
{\an8}I know the scene, thank you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:55" />

<p>
{\an8}[slurps, gulps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:56" />

<p>
{\an8}Ah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:57" />

<p>
[phone rings, beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:00" />

<p>
Hello?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:01" />

<p>
<i>-BoJack, this is Angela Diaz.</i>

-Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:04" />

<p>
<i>We met once before.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:09" />

<p>
I remember.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:10" />

<p>
{\an8}I saw your interview several months back.

It made me nostalgic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:15" />

<p>
Me too. Nostalgic for the day

before I did the interview.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:17" />

<p>
Oh, yes, humor. [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:19" />

<p>
{\an8}If you're free tonight, you could come by

the house, watch the fire, reminisce.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:24" />

<p>
{\an8}There's something

I've been meaning to ask you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:26" />

<p>
-What?

-<i>Wouldn't you love to find out?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:29" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:33" />

<p>
{\an8}So, the Stephen King musical opened

right next door to the Sondheim revival.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:37" />

<p>
{\an8}We have clients in both.

 I was worried there'd be tension,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:39" />

<p>
{\an8}but it turns out <i>Misery</i> loves <i>Company.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:41" />

<p>
{\an8}Judah, are you in a band?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:43" />

<p>
{\an8}Why do you ask that?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:44" />

<p>
{\an8}I've always wondered if you were in a band

ever since this afternoon

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:47" />

<p>
{\an8}when I overheard Juniper tell Stuart

that you were in a band.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:50" />

<p>
You're playing a gig tonight,

and the whole office is going.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<p>
{\an8}I was planning to invite you,

but didn't want you to feel obligated.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:54" />

<p>
{\an8}-We're not good.

-[phone ringing]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<p>
{\an8}Lenny! How the shell are you?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:58" />

<p>
I got trouble, PC!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:59" />

<p>
You know Teddy Buttons,

my head of production?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:01" />

<p>
I'm familiar with Teddy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:03" />

<p>
I somehow missed that Teddy has spent

the last 20 years showing women his...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:07" />

<p>
I'm familiar.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<p>
See, that's why I love you.

You're discreet.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:10" />

<p>
-You're tough. You're Teflon.

-That's me, an old frying pan.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:14" />

<p>
I could use someone who can

handle the heat over here.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:16" />

<p>
Someone who can be more

professional and less... Moonves.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:19" />

<p>
What are you saying?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:21" />

<p>
I want you to run Turteltaub's

new female-focused studio division,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:25" />

<p>
-Girtletaub!

-I didn't sneeze.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<p>
No, Girtletaub is the studio.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<p>
I wanna announce a slate

before the Teddy story hits the trades.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<p>
You think you can throw one together?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:33" />

<p>
You want me to pitch

my dream movie studio?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<p>
<i>I need it tomorrow morning. We gotta hit</i>

<i>the ground running with this thing.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<p>
[stammers] You don't wanna

go slow and steady?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<p>
-What am I, a tortoise?

-[phone beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<p>
Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:44" />

<p>
Get me box office numbers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<p>
We need firm financial figures to frame

how fans flock

to flicks that flex chicks,

woman films,

like <i>Pretty, Wonder, Little.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:53" />

<p>
<i>Diary of a Mad Black.</i>

I'll get my laptop.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:55" />

<p>
Oh, wait! Your gig.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:56" />

<p>
I have time. This is important.

<i>When a Man Loves a...</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<p>
-What?

-That's another film title,

as we were discussing previously.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:03" />

<p>
Oh, of course.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:08" />

<p>
Mm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:10" />

<p>
[phone rings, beeps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<p>
-Hey, Guy, I'm about to...

<i>-Diane.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:15" />

<p>
Am I wearing a T-shirt right now that says

"Treat me like I'm some kind of asshole"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:18" />

<p>
I can't see you right now,

but I'm guessing by your tone, no?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<p>
Then why is my ex-wife treating me

like I'm some kind of asshole?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:24" />

<p>
Did you tell her

you weren't wearing the shirt?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:26" />

<p>
Lady got a job in Houston.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:27" />

<p>
She's taking Sonny out of school

and moving to Texas.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:30" />

<p>
She can't do that!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:31" />

<p>
Well, she can,

because she has full custody.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:33" />

<p>
And this is her dream job, and I'm really

happy for her. But this sucks!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:36" />

<p>
Well, they must need cameramen

in Houston, and I can write anywhere...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:42" />

<p>
I... couldn't ask you to do that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:44" />

<p>
I wouldn't ask you to ask.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<p>
If Sonny's going to Houston,

then we're going.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:49" />

<p>
Okay. Okay. All right. Houston.

Uh, g-go, Astros!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:53" />

<p>
Go... rodeos!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:54" />

<p>
Hope you like barbecue!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:55" />

<p>
I hope I don't need another abortion

because they are hard to get there!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:59" />

<p>
-Wait, what?

-Just trying to think of Texas things.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<p>
Sorry. Houston!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<p>
All day at the airport,

I watch people pull suitcases.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<p>
Why do we suffer

that extra weight dragging us down?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:11" />

<p>
Because we need clean clothes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:13" />

<p>
The point is: helium luggage.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<p>
Why pack light

when you can pack lighter than air?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<p>
All right, so Mom's too sick

to come out of her room

but not too sick

to make her famous Frito pie?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:23" />

<p>
Well, she wanted to see you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:25" />

<p>
She was fine all day

and then suddenly ill with a stomach bug.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<p>
I wanna see her.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:29" />

<p>
No, no, no, no, she's not there!

She's at the Zumba.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<p>
Is she at Zumba or is she sick?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:34" />

<p>
She is sick but was hoping

the Afro-Latin fusion beats

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:37" />

<p>
-would make her feel better.

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:39" />

<p>
This was a mistake.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:42" />

<p>
-[car alarm chirps]

-[Todd] Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:46" />

<p>
Todd, I must confess to you,

your mother is not at Zumba.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:49" />

<p>
I can see her in the window.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<p>
Oh! That's a mannequin

so I can test out my outfits.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<p>
-You're lying again!

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:56" />

<p>
Okay. She didn't come to dinner

because she's ashamed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<p>
She can't say hello?

The woman has my kidney!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:02" />

<p>
And that's why she's ashamed.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:04" />

<p>
A mother shouldn't owe her child her life.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:07" />

<p>
If she could turn it around somehow,

save your life...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<p>
-But, alas, she cannot.

-Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<p>
But maybe if she could...

but no, you’re obviously healthy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:17" />

<p>
-But if you weren't...

-[gasps]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:19" />

<p>
-But you are.

-Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:20" />

<p>
-Clearly there is nothing to be done.

-Hmm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:29" />

<p>
[coughs] Ugh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:35" />

<p>
[inhales, sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:38" />

<p>
[clears throat]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:39" />

<p>
-[Angela] <i>Hey.</i>

-Wha--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:40" />

<p>
<i>Aren't you the horse</i>

<i>from "Horsin' Around"?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:43" />

<p>
[chuckles] Mm.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:47" />

<p>
[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:50" />

<p>
Look at this thing.

I fell down one time and I'm an invalid.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:54" />

<p>
-Word to the wise, BoJack, don't get old.

-I'll see what I can do about that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:58" />

<p>
My 40-year-old companion

treats me like a fragile antique.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:01" />

<p>
I've got a Lamborghini Miura

and she won't even let me drive it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:04" />

<p>
I'm sorry to hear that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:06" />

<p>
Anyway, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:09" />

<p>
Uh...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:10" />

<p>
Yeah?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:11" />

<p>
I'm sorry that at the '94 upfronts

we made you do that stupid BoJack dance.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:16" />

<p>
Oh. Is that why you wanted

to see me tonight?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:19" />

<p>
No. You're tall.

I need you to reach a box.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:25" />

<p>
"Melanie, good luck with your braces.

I think they look cool."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:32" />

<p>
Huh?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:34" />

<p>
Mr. Peanutbutter?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:37" />

<p>
{\an8}Oh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:39" />

{\an8}Uh...

<p>
-Diane!

-You wrote a memoir?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:47" />

<p>
Oh, yeah! I had the idea a few months ago,

then one weekend it just fell out of me.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:51" />

<p>
-What?

<i>-From the way people talk about writing,</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:53" />

<p>
I always assumed it was very difficult,

but it turns out it's not at all,

literally anyone can do it!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:08:59" />

<p>
Yes, that's always been my experience.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:01" />

<p>
I loved your new book, by the way.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:03" />

<p>
-Thanks.

<i>-I'm happy for you, Diane.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:06" />

<p>
Even though it's really easy

to write a book,

it's still an accomplishment

to be proud of.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:10" />

<p>
-I am.

<i>-And how's Chicago?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:12" />

<p>
Are you a Chicagoan yet?

You know, I went to school in Chicago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:15" />

<p>
You went to Northwestern.

That's not in Chicago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:18" />

<p>
Ah! You <i>are</i> a Chicagoan!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:20" />

<p>
I'm actually about to move to Houston.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:23" />

<p>
In New York? Oh, I think there

they pronounce it "Hose-town."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:26" />

<p>
No, Texas. My boyfriend and I are going.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:29" />

<p>
Oh, wow! Boyfriend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:32" />

<p>
-Yeah.

-That's fantastic.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:35" />

<p>
I wanna hear all about him.

I assume he's a good guy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:38" />

<p>
He's actually the best Guy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:43" />

<p>
His girlfriend looks nice.

He seems healthy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<p>
What-- What's his job?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:47" />

<p>
I think he runs a daycare,

but he talks about the babies

as if they're his co-workers,

so it's impossible to know for sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:54" />

<p>
-I should have been there.

-We'll try again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<p>
-[phone rings]

-Oh!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:59" />

<p>
-Hello?

-[woman] <i>Listen up, Helen.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:01" />

<p>
<i>I've kidnapped your son</i>

<i>and I demand a ransom or I will--</i>

</p>

<p>
-[whispers] Next card?

-[grunts]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<p>
"Murder him!"

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:07" />

<p>
Oh, no! Todd's gonna get murdered

by a fearsome stranger

whose sage, buttery voice simultaneously

comforts me and fills me with dread.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:14" />

<p>
Sounds like a lot of range

for a kidnapper.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:16" />

<p>
Who are you and what do you want?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<p>
"I'm your worst nightmare and I want

one hundred of your famous Frito pies."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:24" />

<p>
Yes. Anything!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<p>
"Under the Hyperion Street Bridge

in one hour."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:29" />

<p>
That was perfect! Thank you, Margo!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:32" />

<p>
It's the least I can do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:33" />

<p>
Getting you to buy

that addictive video game

was the act that set me down

this ruinous path so many years ago.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:40" />

<p>
If I can make things right by you,

maybe there's hope yet

for this wretched soul.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<p>
Okay!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:51" />

<p>
[groaning]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<p>
Open it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<p>
-Whoa.

-The studio went all-out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:59" />

<p>
They even found your original screen test.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:01" />

<p>
That's incredible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<p>
Too bad no one will ever see it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:04" />

<p>
After your interview,

we couldn't give these things away.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:07" />

<p>
Oh, right. Sure.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<p>
It was a great show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:11" />

<p>
It would be a shame

for it to be forgotten now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:13" />

<p>
Maybe it's for the best.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:15" />

<p>
I just feel so bad for Sarah Lynn.

She was so good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:18" />

<p>
It's tragic

she won't be remembered for it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:20" />

<p>
Well, nothing we can do

about it now, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:25" />

<p>

</p>

<p>
I've completed a projection

for female-led films over five years.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:32" />

<p>
It's encouraging but vague until I get

the specifics of your dream slate.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<p>
I don't know what that is!

I don't remember my dreams.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:38" />

<p>
Did I ever even have dreams? [sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<p>
If you leave now,

you can still make your show.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<p>
My job is to be here when you are.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<p>
No. Don't give your whole life

to this job,

because if you do, someday someone

will finally ask you what you want

and you'll realize

you don't even know anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:56" />

<p>
-Okay.

-I'm sorry to miss it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<p>
You missing it

will make eye contact easier tomorrow.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:01" />

<p>
[chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<p>
Gronkle has been re-cutting

old episodes of <i>The Cosby Show</i>

to take out all the Cosby scenes.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:12" />

<p>
-They call it "The Show."

-Huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:14" />

<p>
They wanna try something similar

with "Horsin' Around."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<p>
So, it'll just be "Around"?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<p>
It'll just be around eight minutes

an episode,

which is perfect

for today's ADD-addled youth.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:26" />

<p>
It's about three precocious orphans

living without any adult supervision,

who learn that wisdom and guidance

can be found everywhere.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<p>
It's all "around."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:37" />

<p>
Well, sounds like

you got it all figured out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:39" />

<p>
-What do you need me for?

-Your backend.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:41" />

<p>
Nobody's going to watch the show

if they think

you're still profiting off it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:44" />

<p>
-I need that money now more than ever.

-We want to buy you out.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<p>
A one-time payment and then

you're divorced from the show forever.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<p>
[inhales] Oof.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:56" />

<p>
Do it for Sarah Lynn.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<p>
Doesn't she deserve more

than to be remembered

as the girl you killed?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:03" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:05" />

<p>
Have you seen the episodes

without me in them?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:07" />

<p>
-Mm-hmm.

-And they're good?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:08" />

<p>
If you sign that document, you won't need

to worry about that ever again.

</p>

<timestamp data-time="00:13:21" />

<p>
I'm fine with my water, thanks.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<p>
You're not fooling anyone

with that water bottle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:25" />

<p>
Let me fix you a real drink.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:28" />

<p>
One.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<p>
Wow, this is a huge crowd for us.

Is everyone from your office here?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<p>
[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:37" />

<p>
Not everyone.

</p>

Judah, obviously

I was speaking figuratively.

It's funny. I remember a time

when I was scared you'd leave the show.

you were going to call my bluff.

there was nothing I could have done...

<p>
It's funny, isn't it?

The things that matter?

</p>

<p>
The truth is none of it matters

and the truth is it all matters

tremendously.

</p>

<p>
It's a wonder any of us

ever get out of bed at all.

</p>

And yet, we get out of bed.

<p>
-What?

-You're not using it.

<p>
-Why?

-<i>Offensive to Susans.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:30" />

There was a protest

organized by Susan Sarandon.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:33" />

<p>
Oh, no!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:34" />

<p>
Not that many Susans showed up.

You know what they say about Susans.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:37" />

<p>
They're lazy?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:39" />

<p>
Suddenly you're desperately seeking them.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:41" />

<p>
Anyway, I don't know

how we got talking about me for so long.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<p>
You were gonna tell me

about your boyfriend. It's good?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:46" />

<p>
It's really good. When I'm with him,

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:48" />

<p>
I feel like I'm part of an "us," you know?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<p>
Like, every other relationship, I always

felt like a "me" in a relationship.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:54" />

<p>
Does that make sense?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:55" />

<p>
Uh, yeah. That makes sense.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<p>
Sorry. I-I didn't realize

I was doing that.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:00" />

<p>
I've always tried to be

an "us" with people

even when I could see

it wasn't a good idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:04" />

<p>
Now that I'm single, I feel like

I'm finally learning how to be a "me."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:07" />

<p>
That's great.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:08" />

<p>
<i>I know there were times you would</i>

<i>try to tell me something</i>

and instead of listening,

I just tried to fix it

or convince you there wasn't a problem.

<timestamp data-time="00:18:15" />

<p>
<i>I shouldn't have done that.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:16" />

<p>

-Know what?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:20" />

<p>
Tell me what it's like to be Diane.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:23" />

<p>
Okay. When you're Diane,

you can live your whole life

like it's a puzzle,

put together

from the pieces of different sets.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:34" />

<p>
Like a crossover puzzle?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<p>
Exactly.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:37" />

<p>
Your whole life is full

of these pieces that don't quite fit.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:40" />

<p>
Sounds like a hard puzzle.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<p>
But at some point,

you start to think it's you.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:46" />

<p>
<i>You're the piece that doesn't quite fit.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<p>
<i>And you spend so long with that feeling</i>

<i>that the feeling becomes your home.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:55" />

<p>
And it can be jarring

when you discover one day

that you suddenly

don't feel that way anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:01" />

<p>
At first, you don't trust it.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:03" />

<p>
But then, gradually, you do.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:06" />

<p>
I'm sorry. That was a weird thing

to be telling my ex-husband.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:09" />

<p>
No.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:11" />

<p>
-I'm really happy for you, Diane.

<i>-It's funny.</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:14" />

<p>
I feel like if we met each other

as the people we are now,

things would be totally different with us.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:19" />

<p>
Yeah, but if we hadn't met

each other until now,

we wouldn't be the people we are now.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:26" />

<p>
Yeah.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<p>
Two equally accomplished book writers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:31" />

<p>
Uh-huh.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:33" />

<p>
-[roars, laughs]

-[screams]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:35" />

<p>
You suffered an anxiety attack.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:37" />

<p>
I'd encourage you to avoid

stressful situations like, uh,

fake kidnappings under abandoned bridges.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:44" />

<p>
Okay, paperwork time.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:45" />

<p>
You seem like a fellow who enjoys

unnecessary bureaucracy.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:49" />

<p>
I do, Doctor.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:51" />

<p>
Mm, was that the bridge

where they shot <i>Grease?</i>

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:55" />

<p>
-Yeah!

-That's neat.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<p>
Todd, I'm so sorry!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:00" />

<p>
Oh, no, I know you didn't mean to--

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:02" />

<p>
I thought kicking you out

was the right thing.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:05" />

<p>
You were 18.

You had dropped out of high school.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<p>
You were always high.

You only wore flip-flops.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:10" />

<p>
-You never showered.

-You don't have to list everything.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:13" />

<p>
I wanted you to grow up,

not leave forever.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:16" />

<p>
Then more and more time passed

and I didn't know how to make it right.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<p>
Truth is, I did grow up. Your plan worked.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:23" />

<p>
I haven't had a mom for so long, I...

I don't really need one anymore.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:28" />

<p>
Oh. So, what do we do now?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<p>
Well, I do have one idea.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<p>
-What?

-A big robot suit like in <i>Aliens,</i>

but for babies

so they can do grown-up things!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:40" />

<p>
-That sounds dangerous.

-Yeah, I guess it is.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:45" />

<p>
But maybe the robots could be powered

by energy generated

from sucking on pacifiers.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:51" />

<p>
That is so smart! Babies love sucking

and right now it's just wasted energy!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:57" />

<p>
[Margo's voice] And so you see,

the circle had become complete.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:00" />

<p>
All the twists and turns had all been

part of a beautiful tapestry,

a grander mission to bring this boy

and his mother together again.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:10" />

<p>
That's quite a story.

But you've killed a lot of people.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<p>
-Margo Martindale, you're going to pris--

-[woman] Wait!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:18" />

<p>
You can't send her to jail before

she gets to act in one of my movies!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:21" />

<p>
Indie filmmaker Nicole Holofcener?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:24" />

<p>
I find it hard to believe Margo Martindale

has never appeared in your work.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:28" />

<p>
It's true! And I need her to play

the mother of the poetry student

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:31" />

<p>
Catherine Keener has an affair with

in my new film, "Classroom Warfare."

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<p>
Ooh! Can I, Mr. Judge? Please?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:38" />

<p>
Damn, that does sound good.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:41" />

<p>
Okay, you're free to go.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:43" />

<p>
Yee-haw!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<p>
[brakes squeak]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<p>
Come on. Open. Open! Open up! [grunts]

</p>

<p>
God. Where's my stupid...

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<p>
[groans] Why is everything so difficult?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:04" />

<p>
Have it your way, door.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:07" />

<p>
Todd! How come we never go swimming?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<p>
This is terrible.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:15" />

<p>
Well, hello.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:18" />

<p>
Who put pills in my house?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<p>
Judah, you were supposed to have

the night off! Your hair is so long!

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:31" />

<p>
-I'd rather be here.

-[sighs]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:33" />

<p>
I know.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<p>
Would you think I was an idiot

if I didn't go work for Turteltaub?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:38" />

<p>
I would never think you were an idiot.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:40" />

<p>
This slate we're putting together...

[stammers]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:43" />

<p>
We could get some financiers

and do it ourselves, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:47" />

<p>
If there's one thing I know

about this business,

it's never underestimate

what Princess Carolyn can do by herself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<p>
Well, not all by myself.

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:55" />

<p>
Well... [chuckles]

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:56" />

<p>
I've got the babysitter 'til 11:00.

We might as well keep working, right?

</p>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:00" />

<p>
-How can I help?

-Why don't you play me one of your songs?
