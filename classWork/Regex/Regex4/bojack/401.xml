<line>
[man] So you said let's do the show

about the horse,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:08" />

<line>
-but this time without the horse.

-[woman] I know, I'm sorry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:11" />

<line>
[man] And I said,

"That's a terrible idea."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:13" />

<line>
And you said, "I got someone

even better." I got...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:15" />

<line>
-What's this asshole's name again?

-Vincent D'Onofrio.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:19" />

<line>
-And here we are.

-[director] Okay. Action!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:23" />

<line>
Hey, Zoe. Hey, Zelda.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:26" />

<line>
-I forgot my boombox.

-And your deodorant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:29" />

<line>
-Pee-yew, mister.

-[audience laughs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:31" />

<line>
-Zoe, that's no way to get adopted.

-Adopted, by me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:35" />

<line>
Children, I'm a single

breakdancing instructor

who can barely take care of himself.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:39" />

<line>
Plus, I'm too rad to be a dad.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:43" />

<line>
[rhythmic grunting] Ooh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:44" />

<line>
And shake it up. Hah!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:47" />

<line>
-[man coughs]

-Cut!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:48" />

<line>
[klaxon blares]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:49" />

<line>
It's fine, Katrina. If I didn't randomly

wander into doors all the time,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:54" />

<line>
I never would have ended up

co-piloting the very plane

that brought me to Los Angeles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:00:58" />

<line>
Excuse me, didn't you see

the flashing red light outside the door?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:01" />

<line>
Of course. That's why I stopped...

what I was doing to come inside.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:06" />

<line>
[laughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:07" />

<line>
Ooh, are you filming a sitcom?

I love sitcoms!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:10" />

<line>
You should have a character say,

"Talk to the hand."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<line>
[laughter]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:13" />

<line>
The hand! Not the face,

where the ears are.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:16" />

<line>
-Newsflash: hands can't hear.

-[laughter and applause]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:18" />

<line>
What do you mean the character

needs to be more likable?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:21" />

<line>
They don't teach likability

at the American Stanislavski Theatre.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:24" />

<line>
Look, this is not about your acting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:25" />

<line>
You don't want an actor,

you want a blank canvas

upon which to project your own

mawkish notions of goodness.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:32" />

<line>
Some man for all seasons

up for a bit of anything--

cheerful, optimistic, indomitable.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:37" />

<line>
I assure you no such man exists.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:40" />

<line>
But you're welcome to keep looking.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:43" />

<line>
This D'Onofrio has had enoughfrio.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:45" />

<line>
-Hah hah!

-Hmm.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:46" />

<line>
But my favorite scenes

are when a character

is completely oblivious to something

really important going on behind him.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:53" />

<line>
That, dear friends, is where the sit

truly hits the com.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:56" />

<line>
-Excuse me.

-Kind of in the middle of something.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:01:58" />

<line>
-He's yakking away, tension's building...

-Hey, you, sir.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:00" />

<line>
...the audience is like,

"Hey, turn around."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:02" />

<line>
Maybe the person behind him

even interrupts him--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:04" />

<line>
-Can we talk to you for a second?

-Just like that.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:06" />

<line>
And then, when it would be ridiculous

to go on even one second longer...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:10" />

<line>
-My name is David Chase.

-Do you mind?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:12" />

<line>
Only then does he say,

exasperated,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:15" />

<line>
"What? What do you want?"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:17" />

<line>
I want your face on billboards,

you beautiful nonsensical clown prince.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:20" />

<line>
-Doggie-doggie what now?

-[laughter and applause]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:24" />

<line>
Kid, how'd you like to be the star of

"Untitled <i>Horsin' Around</i> Knockoff"?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:29" />

<line>
Me, a star? But I have

no experience, no formal training.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:33" />

<line>
Hey, you, you don't need

any of those things.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:36" />

<line>
You got "it."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:39" />

<line>
Ohh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:02:41" />

<timestamp data-time="00:03:51" />

<line>
<i>Well...</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:52" />

<line>
Monocle? No, I think

you're thinking of Mr. Peanut.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:03:56" />

<line>
[Diane] <i>I don't know if you heard</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:00" />

<line>
I want a comprehensive crisscross

of cold calls to Contra Costa County.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:04" />

<line>
I mean, Christ, people, get me signatures.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:06" />

<line>
<i>First, they need to get Woodchuck</i>

<i>Coodchuck-Berkowitz recalled,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:09" />

<line>
<i>which is basically impossible.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:11" />

<line>
<i>So that actually makes it really easy</i>

<i>for me to be supportive.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:13" />

<line>
-[smooching]

-[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:15" />

<line>
-How's the recall effort?

-Stupendous!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:17" />

<line>
Uh, no. We're about 4,000 signatures shy

of stupendous,

and the deadline's in a week.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:22" />

<line>
Even if you don't get all the signatures,

I'll still be proud of you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
Maybe even more so.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:26" />

<line>
But when we do get

the signatures we need--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:29" />

<line>
-please note I said "when," not "if"...

-Noted.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:31" />

<line>
...then the campaign will begin in...

oh, where did you say again, Katrina?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:35" />

<line>
Earnest. When we get the signatures,

the campaign will begin in earnest.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:38" />

<line>
Right. Earnest, California.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:40" />

<line>
{\an8}Earnest is not a city in Cal--

Why do I try?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:43" />

<line>
{\an8}Looks like you two

have everything worked out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:45" />

<line>
{\an8}Just please note

that I am being supportive.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:04:48" />

<line>
{\an8}Noted!

<line>
{\an8}Anyway, call me back.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:00" />

<line>
{\an8}This is Diane, by the way.

Nguyen, obviously.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:06" />

<line>
You sure you wouldn't rather

just play a governor

in a movie or TV show?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:09" />

<line>
I could attach Tommy Schlamme

to direct.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:11" />

<line>
Tommy Schlamme, shmommy Schlamme.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:14" />

<line>
This is bigger than all that.

Don't you recall?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:16" />

<line>
{\an8}-Recall what?

-The governor. We need signatures.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:19" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, sure.

Where do you stand on the issues?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:21" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, he doesn't stand anywhere on issues

because he's not running for governor yet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:25" />

<line>
I'm mainly for people right now

and also for the future.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:29" />

<line>
{\an8}[groans]

Listen, I'm not feeling so hot.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:32" />

<line>
Why don't you go get

signatures downstairs.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:34" />

<line>
Jennifer Garner's in the lobby.

She'll sign on to anything.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:37" />

<line>
Judah! Can I get your John Wilkes Hancock?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:40" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh, I never developed a signature.

I find them unnecessarily ostentatious.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:43" />

<line>
But I can print my name legibly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:45" />

<line>
Thank you, Rain Man-bun.

That'll do nicely.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:47" />

<line>
-Okay.

-[groaning]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:50" />

<line>
Ralph dropped this off for you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:51" />

<line>
"I always make a beeline

to see my feline." Aww!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:05:57" />

<line>
{\an8}Also, you wanted me to remind you about

FX's <i>American Dead Girl</i> miniseries.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:01" />

<line>
Oh, that's right! What train wreck

are we rubbernecking at this year?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:05" />

<line>
They're doing the Sarah Lynn story

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:06" />

<line>
{\an8}and they're looking

for someone to play BoJack.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:09" />

<line>
{\an8}Oh! [retching, coughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:12" />

<line>
Well, as I was saying, FX is looking

for a BoJack Horseman--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:15" />

<line>
[retching, clearing throat] Ugh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:17" />

<line>
-Horseman-- Ho--

-[retching]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:19" />

<line>
-[moaning]

-So, as we discussed earlier,

is this one of the moments

where you would want privacy?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:27" />

<line>
You know what I'd do

if I had eight million dollars?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:30" />

<line>
-Yeah, you'd give it to the waitress.

-Oh, no, no, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:32" />

<line>
I mean, if I had

eight million dollars now,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:35" />

<line>
I'd start a company that makes

remote-controlled drones.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:38" />

<line>
But these drones have a seat

hanging from the bottom

so you can fly around in it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:43" />

<line>
A drone with a throne.

A drone throne.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:47" />

<line>
But if you're in it, isn't it not a drone?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:50" />

<line>
I feel like you're getting

really hung up on labels.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:53" />

<line>
Well, anyways,

with my eight million dollars

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:06:55" />

<line>
I'm starting a new dating app

just for firemen

and redheaded women named Emily.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:00" />

<line>
Aww, you don't need an app,

just hang out with me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:03" />

<line>
Todd, you're great.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:05" />

<line>
What a way to end a sentence.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:06" />

<line>
But I want a boyfriend who isn't asexual.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:10" />

<line>
Whoa. Why did you call me that?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:12" />

<line>
No, no, it's not bad.

I didn't mean it negatively.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:14" />

<line>
-I was just, like, stating it.

-I'm not-- that word doesn't describe--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:18" />

<line>
Okay, okay, I'm sorry,

whatever you call yourself,

you're my friend and I support you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:23" />

<line>
But sometimes labels can be helpful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:26" />

<line>
Wow. Well, I would label

this conversation "rough".

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:07:30" />

<line>
Here's the check.

</line>

during a thunderstorm

on the Fourth of July,

<line>
I had to take a bath,

and there was a stranger in our yard.

There's no need to be nervous,

or calm for that matter

because you've already lost.

and the clock runs out at 9:00 AM.

<i>Plans, Trans, A Man, A Canal, Panama?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:41" />

<line>
Because someone just became available.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:42" />

<line>
Whoa! Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:44" />

<line>
I don't understand what happened.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:46" />

<line>
Let me put it in terms

your dumb dog brain can comprehend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:49" />

<line>
All your life people have been

throwing you bones

because they like you,

but everyone has a ceiling

to their likability.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:09:56" />

<line>
This is a bone you can't have,

because people just don't like you enough.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:03" />

<line>
-I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.

-You know, it's funny.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:06" />

<line>
Personally I like Woodchuck

and he's a fine governor,

but for some reason, even though

I have zero qualifications,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:12" />

<line>
I honestly thought I would have made

an even better governor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:15" />

<line>
-Well, what matters is you tried.

-But I would have been good, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:18" />

<line>
Now that there's no chance

you will ever be governor,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:21" />

<line>
I can tell you honestly...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:23" />

<line>
-Yes. You would have been great.

-[chuckles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:26" />

<line>
Stop. But seriously, though, elaborate.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:28" />

<line>
You care about people,

you follow your heart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:31" />

<line>
Those are important qualities

you should never give up on.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:34" />

<line>
So what you're saying is

I shouldn't give up?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:36" />

<line>
-On those qualities.

-Yeah. Never concede.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:38" />

<line>
-Stick it out, stay in the race.

-Uh-- no--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:41" />

<line>
Uh, maybe we should get

Katrina's two cents on this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:43" />

<line>
-Katrina?

-Race. That's it, Diane!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:45" />

<line>
You diabolical Thin Mint.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:47" />

<line>
You, and only you, are responsible

for the great thing I am about to do.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:52" />

<line>
Katrina?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:54" />

<line>
-[applause]

-[deep breath]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:57" />

<line>
Thank you, thank you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:10:58" />

<line>
Moments ago I found myself

in what seemed to be a no-win situation.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:02" />

<line>
But it turns out

it was a "Nguyen situation."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:05" />

<line>
I'm referring of course

to my supportive wife Diane Nguyen,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:09" />

<line>
-who told me to never give up!

-[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:12" />

<line>
And that's why I am challenging

Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:16" />

<line>
-to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.

-What?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:19" />

<line>
No more petitions

or fancy ballot initiatives,

just a mano a mano,

no-holds-barred slippery slalom

down an ice-covered peak.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:26" />

<line>
Winner gets to be governor,

loser goes home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:29" />

<line>
Your move, Governor.

Mic drop!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:31" />

<line>
-[feedback squeal]

-[cheers and applause]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:33" />

<line>
-Aaah!

-[cheering]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:35" />

<line>
[Woodchuck]

What the hell is he talking about?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:37" />

<line>
It sounds like he's challenging you

to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:41" />

<line>
What an absurd conceit.

Do I even need to respond to this?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:44" />

<line>
No, sir.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:45" />

<line>
Because I'd rather focus

on my drought relief optimization

using geohydration technology,

or DROUGHT plan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:53" />

<line>
If I know anything, this story

will go away in a couple of days.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:11:58" />

<line>
Now Mr. Peanutbutter, you challenged

Woodchuck to a ski race a month ago.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:03" />

<line>
{\an8}Not just any ski race, a high-stakes dash

down Devil's Mountain

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:06" />

<line>
{\an8}-for the governorship itself.

-But still no comment from the governor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:09" />

<line>
Why won't he race you?

That's what I want to know.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:11" />

<line>
You and me both, friendo.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:13" />

<line>
But this isn't an us-ocracy,

it's a dem-ocracy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:17" />

<line>
-[audience] Ooh!

-So let's ask "dem" what "dey" think.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:19" />

<line>
-[cheers and applause]

-Any questions for the governor, folks?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:22" />

<line>
[audience chants]

Why won't Woodchuck race?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:25" />

<line>
So, to be clear, my DROUGHT plan

is actually a drought relief plan.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:30" />

<line>
I see now how that's confusing.

Any other questions?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:33" />

<line>
Are you going to race Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:34" />

<line>
Any questions about the DROUGHT plan?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:38" />

<line>
{\an8}To ski or not to ski?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:40" />

<line>
{\an8}That was the question

posed by William Shakespeare

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:43" />

<line>
{\an8}and it's perhaps even more relevant today.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:45" />

<line>
{\an8}Of course, there <i>are </i>reasons

why a gubernatorial election

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:48" />

<line>
{\an8}should not be decided by a ski race,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:50" />

<line>
{\an8}but are there also reasons

why it should?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:53" />

<line>
{\an8}For the sake of "fairness"

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:54" />

<line>
{\an8}we've brought in two experts

with opposite opinions

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:57" />

<line>
{\an8}who will now have equal time

to just say those opinions

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:12:59" />

<line>
{\an8}because that's what news is.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:02" />

<line>
You think they'll really race

down Devil's Mountain?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:04" />

<line>
What do I care? As long as I've got

my giant bag of kettle corn,

that's the only thing that concerns me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:10" />

<line>
-[Todd grunts]

-[gasps]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:11" />

<line>
-What the?

-Drone Throne strikes again! Ha ha!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:14" />

<line>
Get back here with my kettle corn!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:16" />

<line>
You can't call it a drone

if you're riding on it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:18" />

<line>
Suckers! Hooray!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:20" />

<line>
Ha ha! Oh-- oh, no!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:23" />

<line>
Aw, man.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:24" />

<line>
I was hoisted by my own petard,

the one petard I thought

would never hoist me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:31" />

<line>
[Woodchuck] Unprecedented poppycock.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:33" />

<line>
This poppycock has no precedent.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:35" />

<line>
Maybe it's time to make a statement.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:38" />

<line>
Madeline, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:40" />

<line>
This outlandish buffoonery

is beneath the office of the governor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:42" />

<line>
I can't defile the legacy

of my predecessors

who built the Golden Gate Bridge,

irrigated the Central Valley,

and played Mr. Freeze in a Batman movie.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:51" />

<line>
Can't you see this thing

is eating you alive?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:54" />

<line>
Do it for us, Woodcharles.

Do it for us.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:13:58" />

<line>
[groans]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:00" />

<line>
And so this ski race would be both

undemocratic and unconstitutional,

which is why I will not be racing

Mr. Peanutbutter down Devil's Mountain.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:10" />

<line>
What if the state constitution

were changed to allow it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:13" />

<line>
-Then would you race Mr. Peanutbutter?

-I... [sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:17" />

<line>
Fine. If a state senator

wanted to waste everybody's time

by sponsoring an amendment

to the constitution,

and the motion got two-thirds majority

in both houses

so as to allow

a democratically-elected governor

to accept a ski race challenge

for his office,

then yes, I would race Mr. Peanutbutter.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:36" />

<line>
Well, I guess that puts

that idea to bed, right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:38" />

<line>
-Hmm.

-Right?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:40" />

<line>
-Hmm... [chuckles]

-Right?!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:46" />

<line>
You want me to sponsor a ski race

amendment to the constitution?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:51" />

<line>
Or you could sponsor the amendment

that has a hidden rider

doubling farm subsidies in your district.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:14:56" />

<line>
-Inglewood could use some farms.

-That's right.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:00" />

<line>
I do have these campaign donors--

uh, I mean, constituents

who really care about babies' access

to vaping devices.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:05" />

<line>
-[coughing]

-Uh-huh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:07" />

<line>
I've always wanted to drive across

a bridge to Hawaii.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:11" />

<line>
-Can we do that?

-You got it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:13" />

<line>
Aloha! [giggles]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:14" />

<line>
Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Whoo!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:17" />

<line>
[chuckles] It tickles.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:21" />

<line>
[sighs]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:23" />

<line>
I'm astounded that it has come to this.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:27" />

<line>
But since the exorbitantly expensive

and astonishingly titled I Love California

amendment is now law,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:34" />

<line>
I formally accept Mr. Peanutbutter's

challenge to a ski race.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:38" />

<line>
It happens that I'm an excellent skier

who won numerous medals in the sport

when I raced for Dartmouth

but, again, I am shocked

that fact is relevant

in the matter of selecting

our state's governor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:48" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, I will see you

on Devil's Mountain.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:54" />

<line>
-Whoa!

-This is insane.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:56" />

<line>
You could actually become governor

by winning a race.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:15:58" />

<line>
Yeah. Wow.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:00" />

<line>
You know, it's days like this

I wish I knew how to ski.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:04" />

<line>
-You don't ski?

-Never really got into it, no.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:07" />

<line>
Then why did you challenge the governor

to a ski race?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:11" />

<line>
[chuckles] I didn't think

it would get this far.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:13" />

<line>
You gotta admit, this is pretty out there.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:15" />

<line>
Well, I guess that's it. Oh, well.

Tough break. Bye forever, Katrina.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:18" />

<line>
No, this is not over.

This is just beginning.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:21" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter,

you're going to ski school.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:25" />

<line>
Doggie-doggie what now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:27" />

<line>
[Diane] <i>Hey, BoJack, it's me again.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:29" />

<line>
<i>Where are you, I'm worried,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:31" />

<line>
<i>hope you're not dead,</i>

<i>etc... you get it.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:32" />

<line>
<i>Anyway, things are even crazier</i>

<i>around here lately.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:36" />

<line>
<i>Don't know if you've seen the news,</i>

<i>but I really wish you were here for this.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:39" />

<line>
Well, I'm off to ski school

so I can learn how to ski,

so I can become the governor.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:44" />

<line>
[Diane] Y<i>ou'd say something like,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:45" />

<line>
<i>"That's the dumbest thing</i>

<i>I've ever heard."</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:47" />

<line>
Sounds great, sweetheart.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:49" />

<line>
But as the old saying goes,

that's politics.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:52" />

<line>
[Diane] <i>Then you'd probably say,</i>

<i>"A, that's not an old saying</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:54" />

<line>
<i>and, B, that's not politics!</i>

<i>Nothing about that is politics."</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:16:58" />

<line>
This is so great!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:00" />

<line>
<i>Then you would be so overwhelmed</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:01" />

<line>
<i>by the unbearable ludicrousness</i>

<i>of the situation</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:03" />

<line>
<i>that you would get in your car</i>

<i>and drive to Hawaii,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:06" />

<line>
<i>which is also a thing you could do now</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:08" />

<line>
<i>because of a new bill</i>

<i>that cost our state billions of dollars.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:10" />

<line>
<i>It's all so great!</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:14" />

<line>
[sighs] <i>You know, it's funny,</i>

<i>because the last time I saw you</i>

you <i>told </i>me <i>that you needed me</i>

<i>in your life,</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:21" />

<line>
<i>and then you just disappeared.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:23" />

<line>
<i>So how do you think</i>

<i>that makes me feel?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:25" />

<line>
<i>Well, wherever you are,</i>

<i>I hope you're happy.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:29" />

<line>
<i>I really do, BoJack.</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:31" />

<line>
<i>Also, I haven't seen Todd in a while.</i>

<i>He's not with you, is he?</i>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:36" />

<line>
[munching]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:38" />

<line>
Oh, simple kettle corn.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:40" />

<line>
Between the worlds of the sweet

and the savory.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:44" />

<line>
Not quite popcorn, not quite candy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:47" />

<line>
-What are we?

-[cawing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:50" />

<line>
Hey, get away! Get, get!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:52" />

<line>
[gasping, choking]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:57" />

<line>
Wow, my first day at ski academy.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:17:59" />

<line>
What collegiate shenanigans

will befall me?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:02" />

<line>
There will be no shenanigans

on my watch.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:05" />

<line>
Professor Thistlethorpe,

the famously humorless yet somehow

also lovable ski instructor?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:09" />

<line>
Peanutbutter, is it?

Everything about you disgusts me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:13" />

<line>
Uh...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:14" />

<line>
And yet, there might be

something in you after all.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:18" />

<line>
You really mean it?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:19" />

<line>
This shall be my greatest challenge.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:22" />

<line>
Meet me on the summit

tomorrow at daybreak.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:25" />

<line>
Well, it is daybreak

and here we are at the summit.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:28" />

<line>
First lesson, break your skis in half.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:30" />

<line>
Oh, I don't have skis.

Was I supposed to bring skis?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:33" />

<line>
-You didn't say that.

-No bother. They shan't be required.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:36" />

<line>
Instead, read this book of poetry.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:39" />

<line>
I'll see you in the classroom.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:42" />

<line>
Ah, there you are.

Did you read the book of poetry?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:45" />

<line>
No! I forgot to.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:47" />

<line>
-Excellent.

-I'm sor-- Excellent?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:49" />

<line>
My assignment was a test.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:51" />

<line>
Skiing isn't about reading old books.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:54" />

<line>
-It's about speaking truth to power...

-Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:56" />

<line>
...and you have spoken it eloquently.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:18:59" />

<line>
You are my finest student.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:02" />

<line>
I love you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:04" />

<line>
[coughing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:05" />

<line>
-Are you okay, professor?

-Just a cough.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:07" />

<line>
I'm sure it's nothing. You can come by

tomorrow for your diploma.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:13" />

<line>
I can't believe ski school

is already over.

Professor Thistlethorpe?

Professor Thistlethorpe!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:18" />

<line>
[weakly] Remember everything

I taught you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:22" />

<line>
I will.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:24" />

<line>
Also, if you have any tips for skiing,

that would be really helpful.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:27" />

<line>
The most important part of skiing

is to keep your legs ben...

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:36" />

<line>
[sobbing]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:39" />

<line>
Who's Ben?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:53" />

<line>
{\an8}Devil's Mountain is the place,

skiing is the sport.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:56" />

<line>
I'm uncomfortable.

It's cold out.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:19:58" />

<line>
Tell me, who do you think

will win today's bout

and what does it mean

for the future of California?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:03" />

<line>
I hate winter sports.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:04" />

<line>
I want to go inside and drink a cider.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:07" />

<line>
-[starter's pistol firing]

-And they're off!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:08" />

<line>
[grunts, yelling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:12" />

<line>
[Tom] Woodchuck, off to a great start.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:14" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter seems to be employing

some sort of awkwardly

falling down technique.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:20" />

<line>
-Any sign of them?

-Nothing yet.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:22" />

<line>
-Oh! I made you a card.

-You did?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:25" />

<line>
[chuckles] Oh, wow, it's sparkly.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:27" />

<line>
Sorry, I went a little overboard

with the glitter

and a little underboard with the glue.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:31" />

<line>
[Ralph] "Let's move in together.

I think I'm ready now."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:34" />

<line>
This is great.

Are you sure, though,

because last time you seemed

a little hesitant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:39" />

<line>
-No, I was just a little pregnant.

-Oh!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:42" />

<line>
I was gonna tell you, really,

but then before I could tell you

there was nothing to tell you.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:46" />

<line>
Oh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:48" />

<line>
I'm so sorry. I still wish

you would've told me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:52" />

<line>
I have a card for that. On the front

it says, "Life isn't fairage."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:55" />

<line>
I'm sorry. I just felt dumb

because all my life I've wanted a family.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:20:59" />

<line>
But I didn't want it to happen

just because I got pregnant by accident

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:02" />

<line>
-and then you got stuck with me.

-Okay, first of all,

if I get stuck to something,

you're the prettiest glue trap I ever saw.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:07" />

<line>
-You know what I mean.

-Second, if that's how you feel,

maybe you shouldn't get pregnant

by accident.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:13" />

<line>
-Well, I didn't try to!

-No.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:14" />

<line>
I'm saying maybe we should

get you pregnant on purpose.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:17" />

<line>
-Really?

-Yeah.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:19" />

<line>
We love each other,

and we enjoy having sex with each other--

and we're good

at having sex with each other.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:23" />

<line>
And also, I think you'd be

an amazing mother.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:26" />

<line>
-[sighs]

-Even Blake Lively thinks so.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:29" />

<line>
Ah, still got it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:34" />

<line>
Yes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:35" />

<line>
[grunting, yelling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:37" />

<line>
Whoa! Whoa-ho-ho!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:40" />

<line>
Ohh! Get control.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:42" />

<line>
Woodchuck in the lead,

still in the lead.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:44" />

<line>
Woodchuck remains

very much in the lead.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:48" />

<line>
Goodbye, dear friend.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:49" />

<line>
You served me well.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:51" />

<line>
[gasps] Okay, all right, here we go.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:55" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:56" />

<line>
Ohh! [yelling]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:21:59" />

<line>
[grunting, gasping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:03" />

<line>

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:08" />

<line>
I see Woodchuck!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:10" />

<line>
Yes!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:11" />

<line>
Go, Woodcharles!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:14" />

<line>
Oh... whoa... [grunts] Whoa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:16" />

<line>
Oh, my God.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:19" />

<line>
Todd forever!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:22" />

<line>
Whaa!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:23" />

<line>
-[crowd gasping]

-Ow, ow, ow, ow! [grunts]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:27" />

<line>
-[crowd cheering]

-Invictus!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:30" />

<line>
-[groaning, grunts]

-Ooh! Ooh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:32" />

<line>
-[moaning]

-Oh... ohh.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:35" />

<line>
-Did I win?

-Come on, honey.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:37" />

<line>
Let's go home.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:39" />

<line>
-[applause]

-Well, I hope that settles it.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:41" />

<line>
We can finally put an end

to this nonsense.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:44" />

<line>
Sir, the rules are clear: the first person

to cross the finish line becomes governor,

and, well, a strange boy

fell out of the sky

and crossed the line first.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:52" />

<line>
They're swearing him in now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:54" />

<line>
-So help me Todd.

-Congratulations, Governor Chavez.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:57" />

<line>
[cheers and applause]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:22:59" />

<line>
You know, ever since

I first became governor

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:02" />

<line>
I've thought,

"I don't want to be governor"

and that's where I am now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:06" />

<line>
So, can I not be governor?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:08" />

<line>
[groaning and gasping]

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:10" />

<line>
You'd like to resign?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:11" />

<line>
Yeah. I'm just really not

into labels right now.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:14" />

<line>
Maybe after some soul searching

I'll be ready to really know what I am.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:17" />

<line>
But for right now,

I think I speak for all Californians

when I say, "I ate too much kettle corn

while drifting through the sky

on an out of control drone throne."

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:29" />

<line>
Okay, is this charade over?

Can I be governor again?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:32" />

<line>
Sir, we live in a society of laws.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:35" />

<line>
When a governor resigns,

that triggers a special election.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:38" />

<line>
Until which, the governor's seat

shall remain vacant.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:41" />

<line>
-[all gasping]

-Election, you say?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:43" />

<line>
Mr. Peanutbutter, will you run?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:46" />

<line>
-You bet I will, and you know why?

-No, tell me.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:49" />

<line>
Because this whole ski race was a joke.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:52" />

<line>
Of course Woodchuck was gonna beat me.

He went to Dartmouth.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:55" />

<line>
So where's the candidate

for regular schmoes like me,

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:23:57" />

<line>
-who went to Northwestern?

-Is he serious right now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:00" />

<line>
You know, Governor Woodchuck

Coodchuck-Berkowitz

thinks he's better than us,

but is he better than us?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:05" />

<line>
-[crowd] No!

-Uh, if I could say a few words--

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:08" />

<line>
He thinks the race is over.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:09" />

<line>
Well, I say it's just starting.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:12" />

<line>
And he wants me to sit and stay

and roll over?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:15" />

<line>
-No!

-I say California's tired of rolling over.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:19" />

<line>
What do you say?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:21" />

<line>
-[crowd] Yeah!

-[woman] I'm tired.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:23" />

<line>
I say it's time for me

to stand up and speak.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:26" />

<line>
-[cheering]

-Diane-Diane what now?

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:28" />

<line>
So loud as you can,

let me hear what you want.

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:31" />

<line>
[chanting] Peanutbutter!

Peanutbutter!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:34" />

<line>
-Uh, citizens--

-I can't hear you!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:36" />

<line>
Peanutbutter!

Peanutbutter!

</line>
<timestamp data-time="00:24:39" />
