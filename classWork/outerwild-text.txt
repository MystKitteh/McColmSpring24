Unknown Nomai
How can the Eye be older than the universe itself?
Suppose it is a relic from a previous universe.
The early universe was unimaginably hot and dense. If anything existed before, it would have been destroyed.
Suppose the universe is older than previously assumed.
The Ash Twin Project requires a powerful, highly advanced warp core. How should we obtain it?
Solution 2: We could craft a new advanced warp core inspired by the Vessel’s warp core.
Oeno
OENO: The greatest challenge here, I think, is we don’t have the design for such a powerful core, or any of the original crafters of the Vessel’s core.
Clary
CLARY: No, but Poke was apprenticed to Annona, who created the original design, and our Black Hole Forge is adept at crafting simpler cores.
Poke
POKE: I believe I can be of use here! The Vessel’s warp core was created before my time, but Annona explained many of his designs to me.
Idaea
IDAEA: This is the safest path for our clan.
Avens
AVENS: Is the safest path the best one? Our goal is worth the risk.
Cassava
CASSAVA: Is it, though? We’ve tried for so long to find something that I (and others) now believe might be impossible to find. If the search for the Eye is a futile one, we should choose the option with the least potential for harm.
Spire
SPIRE: Abandoning the Vessel’s warp core and its casing means losing valuable knowledge.
Mitis
MITIS: This is true; however, it’s knowledge we have little hope of recovering. It would be best to relearn, I think.
Poke
POKE: I would very much like to craft such a powerful core! More relevantly, I believe the Black Hole Forge crew and I could recreate the basic design.
Cassava
CASSAVA: I imagine I’ve been hard on Poke, again. This in turn means I’ve made things difficult for her sister (Clary).
CASSAVA: If Poke and I are oil and water, Clary is our emulsifier. She certainly makes us a better team than would mixing through shaking (although sometimes I would like to shake Poke!).
CASSAVA: Jokes aside, suppose my own fear of never finding the Eye prompted my argument with Poke. That would be immature of me.
CASSAVA: I should apologize... At least to Clary, who could then tell Poke.
Poke
POKE: I feel strange, trying to recreate Annona’s warp core without him. At times, it still feels strange to no longer be his (very young) apprentice, and for the Black Hole Forge to be in my care and not his.
POKE: Hypothesis: This will always feel strange. Even though my time with him was short, I miss my old mentor, and deeply.
POKE: To have the chance to try is thrilling, but... I don’t want to disappoint everyone. I think I can do this (probably), but what if excitement has clouded my assessment of my own abilities?
POKE: Was I wrong in volunteering to build it...? I was born in this star system, and never saw Annona’s warp core with my own three eyes. I only know what he taught me. What if I’ve bitten off a larger portion than I can consume?
POKE: Still, all I can give is my best. And as Annona would say, should my best prove insufficient, then we will find another way to achieve what’s needed. I have Clary and Root in the forge, and I have my clan. I am not alone!
Solanum
SOLANUM: Formation Of This Universe
SOLANUM: No one knows how this universe was made, but one thing we do know is everything used to be very hot and very dense (tightly packed togehter).
SOLANUM: As this early universe expanded, it also cooled down. Once it had cooled down enough, particles were able to group together to form things like galaxies, stars, and planets!
SOLANUM: Since then, space has continued to expand at a faster and faster rate, which is hard to think about for too long without your brain hurting.
SOLANUM: This universe will keep getting colder and larger, until one day, the stars and the life they support will all die.
SOLANUM: That’s scary to think about, even though Conoy tells me it won’t happen in our lifetimes. But it’ll happen in someone else’s, someday!
Lami
LAMI: Explanation of Festivals
LAMI: All the Nomai clans from all over the universe meet in one place to share what they’ve learned in science and art. It’s called the festival!
Filix
FILIX: Don’t forget, festivals happen every ten years!
Lami
LAMI: We can’t go because we’re stuck here. But Filix says we used to go, too.
LAMI: At some festivals, one clan’s big discovery can mean all the Nomai get to advance, too. Like Annona’s warp core, which made it so everyone can warp long distances and explore more.
LAMI: Each clan has a festival envoy to show their most interesting work. (Our envoy was Thatch!)
LAMI: A single festival could last a long, long time!
Plume
PLUME: Use caution! A black hole sleeps below. You must not slip.

Emergency escape hatch
Nomai computer
BEGIN FLIGHTLOG: Escape Pod 1. Vessel has been mortally injured. Emergency sequence activated. Awaiting departure from Vessel.
Launching Escape Pod 3... Launching Escape Pod 2... Now launching Escape Pod 1.
ALERT. Collision imminent. Preparing for impact.
Scanning external environment... Scan complete. Minor structural instabilities detected. Pockets of breathable air detected. Adequate solar energy detected.
Verdict: HOSPITABLE.
Conoy
CONOY: Cassava’s Construction Yard has been using the cyclones on Giant’s Deep to lift Orbital Probe Cannon parts into orbit, but one component was pushed down past the current that usually prevents anything from sinking.
CONOY: Spire and I are crafting a model to determine why this happened.
Spire
SPIRE: An update: It’s now clear there are two different types of cyclone.
SPIRE: Most cyclones on Giant’s Deep rotate clockwise. These are the cyclones Cassava typically uses to send components into orbit.
SPIRE: There also exists a rarer type of cyclone that spins the opposite direction and pushes objects beneath the waters and below the current.
Cassava
CASSAVA: My gratitude, Spire. Conoy is showing me your handiwork, and I’m intrigued by this secondary type of cyclone. But was it really necessary to build a model to tell me that?
Spire
SPIRE: The model will be useful as we continue monitoring Giant’s Deep.
SPIRE: Also I very much wanted to make a model.
Ilex
ILEX: Look out, look out below!
ILEX: Look out for the gravity hole!
ILEX: For should you slip
ILEX: And lose your grip,
ILEX: Then into space you’ll go!
Plume
PLUME: Of note: Be sure not to wander far from here. Though this area is somewhat unstable, it’s safer than any we’ve found so far.
PLUME: The temporary settlement is finished, but remember to be cautious of falling rocks and dust created by meteor impacts.
Thatch
THATCH: I can’t understand. Why did the Vessel crash in that place?
Plume
PLUME: Was the Vessel unwell in some way?
Filix
FILIX: No, Annona and I checked before the warp, and the warp core and navigation systems were both well.
FILIX: We warped to follow that curious signal from the Eye of the universe. Where we arrived was wrong; it wasn’t where we tried to go.
Thatch
THATCH: Suppose it wasn’t a problem with the Vessel, but with our destination.
Filix
FILIX: I’m afraid for our friends in Escape Pod 3....
Bells
BELLS: If you’re here to make your first pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon, you are almost prepared to set out on this deeply significant journey. Before you do, pause, and remember your history.
BELLS: We make this journey not only for ourselves, but also to honor the members of our clan who came before us: those who, after the crash that brought them to this star system, became stranded on Brittle Hollow and on Ember Twin, with no communication between these two groups of survivors.
BELLS: These Nomai looked upward from two different planets and saw the same wandering moon visiting their skies. It was this moon (the Quantum Moon) that kept their curiosity alive during this long period of hardship.
BELLS: After the two divided groups were able to reunite, it became our clan’s united goal to find and visit the Quantum Moon. This took time, and many Nomai who dreamed of seeing the Quantum Moon died before we discovered how to make the journey.
BELLS: When you reach the Quantum Moon, recall these Nomai, and carry their curiosity onward with you.
Plume
PLUME: The trees are moving! The trees in this grove wander about freely (the entire plant, roots and all)! This is not normal, even for this alien planet. And I never see them move! Is that even possible?!
PLUME: If anyone else witnesses this disturbing behavior, I implore you, record your observations here. Either these trees are aberrant, or my brain must be!
Thatch
THATCH: Plume is right; the trees do move! I confess I didn’t notice until I read his notes.
THATCH: Alarmingly, it isn’t only the trees: There is other matter in this area (such as that unusual shard of rock) moving in this same eerie way.
Filix
FILIX: That rock is unusual for another reason, too, Thatch: It possesses color and texture I’ve never seen elsewhere on this planet!
FILIX: Hypothesis: This rock shard’s presence is significant. We should study it! (Could it be what is causing other nearby objects to also move about this area?)
Thatch
THATCH: Plume, Filix, and I have determined this atypical shard of rock is the reason objects in this grove are behaving in a quantum manner.
THATCH: The only other object we’ve observed displaying this quantum behavior is the wandering moon. I imagine the moon’s behavior and this grove’s are related.
Plume
PLUME: In her note from earlier, Filix mentions this strange type of rock isn’t found elsewhere on Brittle Hollow. What if it isn’t originally from this planet?
PLUME: Hypothesis: This “quantum shard” is from the wandering (quantum) moon. Perhaps it is even a small piece of the moon itself.
Filix
FILIX: Of note: A unique signal is coming from this shard! Curiously, our friend the wandering moon sounds the same.
FILIX: I’ve also heard the same signal this shard produces calling out from Giant’s Deep,Timber Hearth, and the Hourglass Twins. Suppose there are other shards like this one!
Bells
BELLS: Welcome, Solanum! Your arrival here means you’ve completed your preparations on Giant’s Deep and are ready to depart for the Quantum Moon.
BELLS: On your pilgrimage, the Quantum Moon will carry you, just as it carried me and many in our clan before me, to the moon’s sixth and most secret location.
BELLS: You’ll be aided in your pilgrimage by the shrine our clan built on the Quantum Moon. But remember this final rule: To explore the sixth location, the shrine must be on the moon’s north pole.
BELLS: Be curious on your journey!
BELLS: Be welcomed in this place! Above you stands the Tower of Quantum Knowledge.
BELLS: If you are making your first pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon, ascend these stairs, and obtain the last of the knowledge you need for your journey.
BELLS: Beneath your feet lies the Tower of Quantum Knowledge.
BELLS: If you are preparing to make your first pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon, descend the steps to the entrance below. The knowledge held within will help you on your journey.

Laevi
LAEVI: We’re meeting in the Fossil Fish Cave to play the game! If you’re too big to climb through the Anglerfish Overlook hole:
LAEVI: You’ll have to go the long way, but it isn’t far. Go to Stepping Stone Cave, and then up and into the Fossil Fish Cave.
Taget
TAGET: I tried to get to the fossil fish through Stepping Stone Cave, but I couldn’t find the entrance. Where is it?
Ilex
ILEX: Remember to feed the fossil fish first! If you go to the Anglerfish Overlook and throw a light into his mouth, he’ll show you the way.
Lami
LAMI: Taget can’t fit through the Anglerfish Overlook hole anymore because he grew bigger! He’s taller than Laevi now.
Laevi
LAEVI: Who cares? Ilex is still tallest.
Taget
TAGET: Are we playing the fossil fish game tonight?
Solanum
SOLANUM: I fed the fossil fish a new lantern. If you go to Stepping Stone Cave, the entrance to the Fossil Fish Cave is easy to see now.
Laevi
LAEVI: Gratitude, Solanum! It’s good you’re small enough to climb in through the hole at the Anglerfish Overlook.
Lami
LAMI: I’m still small enough!
Laevi
LAEVI: You won’t be for long. Mom and Dad are tall, so you and I will be tall, too.
Melorae
MELORAE: The heat from this star system’s sun is more bearable below the surface.
MELORAE: When our escape pod punctured this planet’s surface, it broke into what scans show is a cave system with much cooler air. I would recommend we seek a site down there to build a long-term shelter, Annona, but these passages are a maze!
Annona
ANNONA: Even with this danger, they are still our best chance for survival. We’ll form teams and descend into the caves to look for a shelter site. We can mark our findings on the walls to avoid becoming irreversibly lost.
ANNONA: Be cautious, everyone.
Rhus
RHUS: And be aware of the sand as you search. It appears to be rising gradually.
Coleus
COLEUS: The path to the shelter site is somewhat convoluted, so follow the instructions ahead closely!
COLEUS: To reach the shelter site, walk forward until you meet the sandfall at the pit, then turn left. Continue to the room filled with rock column formations and climb upward through the opening above them.
COLEUS: The sand here is rising, so you must be cautious but swift.
COLEUS: Be cautious crossing the chasm ahead. The bridge Melorae and I crafted will do its job, but it isn’t strong.
COLEUS: Once on the far side, look for the tunnel hidden behind the falling sand. Follow it, and you’ll reach the shelter site.
COLEUS: You’re doing well! There’s only a little farther left to go now until you reach the shelter site. You can rest there. Hurry, before the sand comes!
Melorae
MELORAE: Do not follow this tunnel to its end! (Coleus and I will examine the horror that lies at its terminus later, provided we live through this.)
Annona
ANNONA: Of note: This passage leads to breathable air. Refill your supply tank there (we cannot tell how far or deep these tunnels may wind), but do not linger, as the area is exposed to the heat of this alien sun.
ANNONA: Refill your air supply tank and return quickly.
Rhus
RHUS: Keep moving, friends: There is nothing of interest at the end of this passage but rocks.
RHUS: And while these rocks are interesting, they can wait until a less urgent time.
Solanum
SOLANUM: The sands go to and fro,
SOLANUM: Reversing their swift flow.

Pye
PYE: I’m receiving much stronger energy readings now that we’re beneath the crust. Whatever it is must lie somewhere below, closer to the comet’s center. And I’m starting to think it’s more dangerous than we realized.
PYE: Clary, can you hear us?
Clary
CLARY: Yes, but your voices are faint. I fear we will lose communication entirely if you continue any deeper.
Poke
POKE: Keep the shuttle warm for us, Clary. We’ll return the moment we identify the source of the energy readings!
Clary
CLARY: I understand, but... Be cautious, both of you.
Poke
POKE: The spherical stone casing here seems to be the source of the energy readings... No, rather, the source is what’s within the stone. I’m detecting some form of exotic matter.
Pye
PYE: The stone is muting our energy readings; they should be ten times what we’re seeing, at least.
Poke
POKE: Pye, I don’t think we want this matter interacting with us. As far as I can tell, direct contact with it would almost certainly be fatal.
Pye
PYE: I’ve never encountered anything like this casing, but it’s all that’s protecting us from what’s inside. Worse still, this matter is disturbingly volatile.
Poke
POKE: ...Pye. Whatever the matter inside this stone casing is, it’s more than just profoundly unstable; it’s under tonnes of pressure. Look at this density scan. I’ve never seen anything this tightly compacted before! What is this?
Pye
PYE: This is orders of magnitude worse than I’d imagined. If this stone were to rupture, the lethal matter within would rapidly expand, completely blanketing this star system almost instantaneously. And the pressure is still building as the comet approaches this star system...
PYE: Return to the shuttle, right now! The rest of our friends need to know they’re in terrible danger. Leave your equipment and run!
Poke
POKE: What are you doing, Pye?!
Pye
PYE: The more we know about this alien matter, the better our chances of survival. I will learn what I can here. Go, warn the others; maybe they can construct shelter somehow. ...Now, Poke!
Clary
CLARY: I fear our situation may be dire:
CLARY: Pye, Poke, and I landed here on this comet not long after its arrival in this star system. Our shuttle’s equipment heard strange energy readings coming from somewhere beneath the surface.
CLARY: Pye and Poke were able to locate a fissure in the ice on the comet’s sunward side, and they descended inside to investigate the source of the readings.
CLARY: But... Pye and my sister have been gone for a long time now. They haven’t contacted me since descending below the surface, either.
CLARY: Should I leave the shuttle to look for them? I want to follow protocol, but I don’t know what I’ll do if they aren’t well...
CLARY: Poke... Pye... Come back to me safely, my friends.
CLARY: This is troublesome: It seems the comet wishes to submerge our shuttle in ice. If we stay on the surface too long, the shuttle may freeze entirely.
Poke
POKE: Even if it did, couldn’t someone call it back home to the gravity cannon on Ember Twin?
Pye
PYE: Yes, but the exploration of the comet would be more difficult if we were without the shuttle until someone recalled it. Perhaps we shouldn’t have landed on the dark side of the comet...
Clary
CLARY: Suppose one of us remained in the shuttle to keep it warm and continue monitoring the surface.
Pye
PYE: This would be wise, I think, Clary. If you don’t mind waiting here with it, Poke and I can continue to investigate the surface.

Self
...Whoa.
Me
What the heck happened?
This is the greatest day of my life!
Are you me from the last loop?
This got weird in a hurry.
AAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
Self
If you're me, then I'm as confused as you are.
Me
Do you think we have the same memories?
Do you think it's okay there's two of us?
Self
Good question. Let's see...
I remember all the time loops, including last loop when I jumped into the black hole in here. What about you?
Me
Me, too. Sounds like our memories diverge at the start of this loop.
Same, except I woke up at the campfire, like always.
Self
It makes sense one of the two versions of us would start at the campfire as usual.
Makes sense to me, seeing how jumping into the black hole is definitely what created two of us.
Sure, two of us is great and all, but is it the greatest? What about the day we, you know... what about that one?
Me
Are you talking about the day I...?
Oh, right. That one's probably still the greatest.
Self
What? No! No, I'm talking about the other one.
Me
OH. Yep, that makes way more sense.
Self
Haha, I know, right? But today is probably the next greatest day of our life after that one.
Me
Wait, can you read my mind?
What other memories do you have?
Think it's okay there's two of us?
Self
Definitely no. I just have the same memories as you. ...Except for this loop, I mean.
I started this loop by popping out of a white hole inside the Ash Twin Project, since in the loop before this one I jumped into the black hole.
Yeah, now you've got it. That was an incredible day.
But today is probably the next greatest day of our life after that one.
Me
Wait, can you read my mind?
What other memories do you have?
Think it's okay there's two of us?
Self
Let's see... We should have all the same memories before the whole "going into space and becoming aware of the alien time loop" thing.
I think so. I started this current loop by popping out of a white hole inside the Ash Twin Project.
Me
I started at the campfire like usual.
What do you remember from before this loop?
Self
Yeah, duplicating living beings probably wasn't what the Nomai had in mind when they built the Ash Twin Project.
Me
I wonder if we have the same memories.
I wonder if there being two of us screws anything up.
Self
Well, we're talking to each other and nothing's exploded yet.
Me
Yeah, it's a pretty novel experience.
Gossan always says that means the date's going well.
Maybe the universe doesn't mind two of us.
Self
Well, we're talking to each other and nothing's exploded yet.
Me
That seems positive.
Yeah, it's a pretty novel experience.
Gossan always says that means the date's going well.
Self
Yeah, but it's Slate's definition of a boring date. Makes sense Gossan and Slate never dated.
Me
That and the whole mishap with Gossan's eye.
Self
Right? It's kind of nice!
Hopefully not. Besides, an extra version of us is definitely better than if we'd created an extra anglerfish or something.
Me
GEH.
That's setting the bar pretty low.
Agreed. We're charming and have fewer teeth.
Self
Oof. Yes. The eye thing.
Yeah, that's... yeah.
Me
Yep.
Sure is.
I very much do not want to discuss that.
Self
My thoughts exactly.
That's not just setting the bar low, that's setting it at tripping height.
That probably counts for something.
Uh huh.
Nor do I. Hasty segue?
Me
Hasty segue.
Self
Quickly changing the subject, you know how I - er, we - jumped into the black hole that opened up at the end of the last time loop?
What do you think would happen if you don't jump in this time?
Me
Huh. That's a good question.
If I don't, then where did you come from?
Guess we'll find out!
Self
So hey, what do you think happens if you don't jump into the black hole again at the end of this loop?
Me
Huh. That's a good question.
If I don't, then where did you come from?
Guess we'll find out!
Self
I think so, at least. Although here's a question for you — what do you think happens if you don't jump into the black hole again at the end of this loop?
Me
Huh. That's a good question.
If I don't, then where did you come from?
Guess we'll find out!
Self
Hey, what do you think happens if you don't jump into the black hole again at the end of this loop?
Me
Huh. That's a good question.
If I don't, then where did you come from?
Guess we'll find out!
Self
It's something I've been wondering about. We're in thoroughly uncharted territory at this point.
Me
Unlike all the other time manipulation we've experienced.
Truly, we are the Feldspar of weird time stuff.
Self
That's a good point.
I mean, I feel as real as ever, so I don't think I'm a figment of your imagination or anything like that.
Me
That's just what a figment of my imagination would say!
I'm no expert, but you seem pretty real to me.
Self
I guess so!
Oh geez, Feldspar would just use the time loop to try increasingly outlandish stunts, wouldn't they. Might be a good thing they aren't aware of it.
Thanks. You seem real to me, too, so... I guess there's just two of us now!
Are you being sassy? You can't sass me! You are me!
Does kind of prove we're the same person, though.
At any rate, it's been good talking to you, me. ...Incredibly strange, but good.
See you around!
What have we done?! Jumping into that black hole was a terrible idea!
Me
Yes. Yes, it was.
I needed to know what would happen.
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Self
...Okay. Okay, I'm calm.
AAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Me
Just needed to get that out of my system.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Self
AAAAAAAAHHHhhhokay, I'm done screaming, too.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Me
AAAAAaaaAAAAAaAAaaaaaHHH!
WAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUGH!
Self
AAAAAaaaAAAAAaAAaaaaaAAAHHH!
Me
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHH!
AAAAAAaaah... hhh... ha.
Self
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUGH!
Me
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAURGLHHH!
AAAAAAaaah... hhh... ha.
Self
AAAAAAAHHHhhh... (pant, pant)...
Me
You good?
...AAAAAAH! AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!
Self
...I'm good.
Me
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!
Self
Hey, me.
Me
Remember leaving on our first solo trip?
Remember landing our ship on the Sun Station?
Self
Yeah! That feels like ages ago.

We'd have died that first time out if the time loop didn't exist, though. Isn't that weird to think about?
Me
Weirder than there being two of us now?
We were disasterously unprepared for space.
Self
Tuff was right - I AM the worst.
Wow, I guess I AM pretty sarcastic.
It's unsettling to think about. Especially when you remember even Riebeck survived their first launch.
YES. I can’t believe no one was around to see that.

We’re probably the best pilot in the space program by now.
Me
Yeah, but we’ve also died more than anyone else.
Not that anyone else knows it.
I needed to brag about that to someone a little.
Did that technically happen, with how the time loop works?
Self
Still, it’s kind of nice to get to say it out loud. Even if it’s just to ourself.
That’s fine. It’s kind of nice to hear it said out loud.
What? ...Oh, come on, don’t take that away from us!
Me
Just kidding, I don't care how time works.
But given it only happened in a previous loop...
Self
The worst part is we’re the same person, and you know I’m going to agree with you. (Sigh...)
Clary
CLARY: Regarding the warp towers on Ash Twin: Does each tower have to be perfectly aligned with the center of the astral body to which it’s tuned?
CLARY: I enjoy precision as much as the next Nomai, but if, for example, a tower’s base were to shift even slightly, that tower might no longer align with its astral body.
Poke
POKE: We don’t need the alignment angle to be exact; it only needs to be within five degrees of the astral body’s center.
POKE: Of note: This gives us a slightly longer warp window. I imagine this window will last roughly several seconds.
POKE: As such, any Nomai stepping onto the warp platform during the active window will be immediately warped. We will need to be careful around the platform for the duration of the time it’s active to avoid accidental transportation.
Clary
CLARY: More accurately, I enjoy precision as much as the next Nomai, provided the next Nomai is not Poke.
Root
ROOT: Where am I taking this first black hole core? (And where am I taking the remaining cores once they’re ready?)
Clary
CLARY: All of the warp towers are being constructed on Ash Twin, so the black hole cores will go there.
Poke
POKE: The white hole cores are for the warp receivers. Each of the six receivers are being constructed at different locations, so those deliveries will be a greater pain in your cervical spine.
Root
ROOT: My gratitude! In that case: Poke, Clary, I’m leaving for delivery! I’ll send Yarrow your regards.
Clary
CLARY: Poke, I’ll return to the forge shortly; I’m going to catch up to Root and help him deliver the first core to Ash Twin, just to make sure Yarrow receives it.
Poke
POKE: Of course you are.
POKE: The tower designs in the High Energy Lab on Ember Twin reveal each receiver's location. Ask Yarrow; he is familiar with them.
Nomai sign
WARNING: Be cautious near the boarding area while the Black Hole Forge is in operation.
Poke
POKE: Of note: Yarrow believes he spotted a flaw in the warp tower designs: namely, that one of the warp towers on Ash Twin will never activate, because its warp receiver will never align overhead.
POKE: Does your romantic interest think a warp tower’s alignment point is its receiver? Does he not know that a warp tower always aligns with the center of its corresponding astral body?
Clary
CLARY: That isn’t an unreasonable belief, given the receiver does have to be located on (or in close orbit around) the relevant astral body.
CLARY: I seem to recall that was your understanding of warp technology, at first.
CLARY: No, Yarrow understands the distinction. He likely doesn’t realize the Hourglass Twins are so close together they function as a single astral body, with a shared alignment point in between them.

Pye
PYE: The Ash Twin Project will be one of our biggest undertakings (metaphorically and physically). To build it, we need a way to travel quickly between Ash Twin and each location that holds crucial project materials.
Root
ROOT: What if we used warp towers (like the one we have on the White Hole Station) to connect Ash Twin directly to each critical location?
Clary
CLARY: Poke, Root, and I can begin work on this immediately in the Black Hole Forge (this will keep us busy!).
Yarrow
YARROW: Of note: Each tower on Ash Twin will warp to a different planet.
Phlox
PHLOX: We can design each tower to visually reflect its warp destination!
PHLOX: The Giant’s Deep tower, for instance, could resemble a cyclone. And we could model the Timber Hearth tower after a geyser mountain!

YARROW: I’m intrigued, love! Everyone here working on the Ash Twin Project is excited to see it (Pye is beside herself with joy!).
Poke
POKE: No, it isn’t!
Yarrow
YARROW: Is everything well at the forge?
Clary
CLARY: Don’t worry, love; Poke is only nervous. The core is extraordinary, and her design work is beautifully clever.
Poke
POKE: The core’s durability could still be improved! I need more time!
Clary
CLARY: Ignore her, Yarrow. The core is finished. And if my sister tells you otherwise, then she will be finished, as well.
Yarrow
YARROW: My gratitude for the latest shipment, Oeno! This ore should be the last we’ll need for the Ash Twin Project.
YARROW: Once we’ve finished the shell that seals off the central chamber, we’ll check to ensure there are no longer any physical entrances. Ramie and I will be checking the interior and then the exterior for cracks (our final safety check).
Oeno
OENO: This is exciting news! Can I offer an extra set of eyes for this final check (specifically, mine)? If my work here is complete, I’d be delighted to help.
Yarrow
YARROW: We’d be grateful if you would! The more eyes, the better, as the smallest flaw or opening in the shell that protects the Ash Twin Project could lead to disaster.
Oeno
OENO: I’m still amazed by how much ore the Ash Twin Project requires!
Cycad
CYCAD: Isn’t this the ore for the remaining towers being built on Ash Twin? The completed towers I’ve seen are quite large!
Oeno
OENO: No, the material for those towers is all being taken from Ash Twin. The ore we’re mining here will be used to craft an immensely thick protective shell that will physically seal off the chamber inside Ash Twin’s core.
Coleus
COLEUS: I’m relieved by our clan’s decision to use Timber Hearth’s ore only for constructing the shell. If, eventually, life on this planet were to evolve to the point of advanced metallurgy, I’m confident we won’t have destroyed their ability to create!
Cycad
CYCAD: If they're sealing off all entrances, I hope they've planned a-core-dingly!
Oeno
OENO: I thought you had forbidden your apprentice from making puns, Coleus.
Coleus
COLEUS: How else would he improve?

Poke
POKE: Welcome to the White Hole Station! If you fell through the black hole by accident (don't worry, you aren’t the first), this warp tower can return you to Brittle Hollow.
POKE: Every warp tower is tuned to a specific astral body. A tower's warp can only be used during the brief window when the tower is aligned with its corresponding astral body (in this case, Brittle Hollow).
You must be standing on the warp platform on the floor during this alignment to be warped.
POKE: If you look up while the station is rotating, you can see the alignment happens when the astral body is directly overhead.

Gabbro
Gabbro
Nice, it’s you. Good to see you made it here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy, isn’t it?
So hey, don’t freak out or anything, but lately I keep, like, dying repeatedly. I dunno, it’s pretty weird.
What about you? Have you died lately, or is it just me?
Me
No, it’s me, too. We’re in a time loop.
Gabbro
Time has been behaving unusually lately. Yeah, a time loop makes sense. Cool.
Me
You’re taking this pretty well.
What did you think it was?
Gabbro
Heh, right back at you.
Personally, I like new experiences, and I’ve never been in a time loop before. I mean, I don’t think I’ve been in a time loop before this one.
I figured it’d be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn’t really thinking about what’s happening to the shape of time, you know? But a loop makes sense here. Let’s go with “loop” for now.
It looks like you and I are the only ones who can tell that time’s gone all weird. I tried radioing Hornfels and asking if they’d died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical.
Even if I tell Hornfels about the time loop, they never remember by the next one. They don’t realize anything’s different.
And here’s another weird one for you - every time I die, all of my memories from that loop replay back to me. I’m pretty sure that’s related to this big stone Nomai statue I found on one of the other islands.
I was looking at it, and the statue opened its eyes and started glowing. It replayed my memories like it’d seen them through my own eyes, just like what happens each time I die.
Me
That happened to me with the statue at the museum.
Gabbro
You too, huh? Then the Nomai statues must have something to do with why we’re the only ones aware of the time loop. So... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?
I think that’s going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I’ll be here.
Anyway, that’s what’s new with me. But hey, this is your first solo voyage! ...Kind of! Let’s talk about you, you know?
Have you ever watched a cyclone for so long, it started to hypnotize you? I’m telling you, they’ll put you in a trance if you stare at ’em long enough.
How’s space treating you?
Me
I found something!
What are you doing out here?
Where should I explore on Giant’s Deep?
What’s up with this planet?
Where’s your ship?
I found your ship!
I saw your ship again.
See you later.
Gabbro
Well, what are any of us doing here, really?
...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you.
But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.
I mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful.
Here’s something you might like — at the start of every time loop, I keep seeing a bright flash in the sky. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet.
What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the island where I found the glowing Nomai statue. ...Get it?
I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It’s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale.
If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it’s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You’ll see.
Haha, I know, right?
...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there.
There’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked.
As for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach.
You’ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they’re hard to miss. They’ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip — if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you.
That’s a good question.
It’s definitely on this planet somewhere. I mean, unless a cyclone came by and tossed it into space, I guess. Heh, that would be pretty nuts.
I hope it’s not lonely.
An excellent question. I haven’t seen it around lately.
I hope it’s not lonely.
Oh, cool. So it’s floating in the ocean, huh?
Did it look like it was having a good time?
I hope it’s having fun! Did you say hi for me?
Cool, cool. Take it easy out there.
Nice, nice. Whatcha got for me?
Me
I reached the inside of Statue Island.
I found the source of the time loop.
I found Nomai masks inside the Ash Twin Project.
I found what happened to the Orbital Probe Cannon.
I found your quantum poem.
I found a photo of you inside the old radio tower.
Actually, nevermind.
Gabbro
So the Nomai created those head statues to record memories, huh? ...Yeah, I could see the Nomai doing that. Not sure what for, but it seems like their sort of thing.
Do you think the statues are recording our memories, then? ’Cause I remember that one on the beach looked at me funny. That must be my memory-friend!
Right, right, the cavern inside Statue Island is where the memory-recording statues were made, I remember.
So your memory statue is the one in the museum back in the crater, and mine’s the one I found on the beach. I kinda dig having my own personal memory-friend.
If you come up with any hunches about what the Nomai wanted to record memories for, feel free to run them by me! You know where I’ll be.
Wait, whoa, really? The Nomai carved out the Ash Twin and built a time loop device inside? ...That is wild.
Now we know what’s causing the loop, then. And... if it’s caused by a device, that must mean it had to be switched on, right? Huh...
Hey, what do you think would happen if you turned off the time loop? Like, there’s a part of me thinks maybe you shouldn’t, what with the sun blowing up and all.
Then again, who wants to spend eternity being blown up by the sun?
...I dunno, I’m no time loop expert. I’m just gonna sit here and ponder the intricacies of time and space. Maybe take a nap, too, if I feel like it.
My head’s still all full of scenarios for what would happen if you turned off the time loop. I’ll probably notice if you decide to mess with it, though, right? Seems like something I’d notice.
This is all pretty wild.
You’re saying the statues were made so memories could be sent back in time? I guess that makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through.
Wait, then it’s just our memories being sent back in time to us, right? Then... are we really experiencing multiple time loops, or not?
That’s pretty deep... Like, maybe our consciousnesses have been through all these loops, but maybe our bodies haven’t, because technically the loops never happened.
Meaning we’re receiving memories of things that will never happen to us. Cool, huh?
Right, you told me earlier that the point of the statues is to send memories back in time. Which I guess makes sense, considering we both have our memories of every loop we’ve gone through.
I thought about it some more, and I think that means our minds have gone through all these loops, but we haven’t actually gone through them ourselves.
Meaning we’re receiving memories of things that technically will never happen to us. Cool, huh?
Whoa, that’s the cannon breaking apart at the start of each time loop? For real?
Did you figure out why?
Me
Too much power.
Overenthusiasm.
Gabbro
...It’s kind of scary how much that sounds like something Slate or Feldspar would do. I’m pretty surprised the Nomai built something that actually broke!
Come to think of it, though, “broke” might be the wrong word. Because it looks like the Orbital Probe Cannon is still firing successfully at the beginning of each time loop.
So the cannon breaks apart right after it launches, huh. Explains what I’m seeing fall from the sky every loop.
I’m still surprised the Nomai built something that isn’t holding together, you know? Them being genius crafters and all.
On the other hand, maybe we should be impressed they made something that could last until modern day in the first place. And it looks like the cannon is still firing successfully at the start of each time loop.
Yeah, the one in the woods, I remember writing that. Pretty fun, right? It works out to a good 24 poems.
When I’m done exploring, I want to make some more quantum art. Maybe some kind of creature sculpture that just, like, shows up and scares the daylights out of you.
Yeah, you mentioned that before. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy.
Nice. Did I look busy in it? I hope I looked busy.
Must have been from the time Hornfels sent me to check on the deep space satellite. They thought Ol’ Spacey might be malfunctioning, but I couldn’t find a single thing wrong with it.
Which is probably how it got a shot of my beautiful be-helmeted face, come to think of it.
I always thought it was kinda sweet that the best way to find Ol’ Spacey is to use a map that’s generated by the satellite itself, isn’t it? Like it’s inviting us to visit. Good ol’ deep space satellite, always making sure we know where we’re going.
Me
Why’d Hornfels think it was broken?
Um. “Ol’ Spacey”?
I have a map?!
Gabbro
Dunno. Hornfels probably told me why, but Hornfels tells me lots of things, and sometimes I tune out. Or pretend there’s signal interference and I can’t hear them.
Best guess says the deep space satellite must have sent Timber Hearth some weird pictures, but like… what’s considered “weird” for a satellite, you know?
Anyway, if you ever want to visit Ol’ Spacey, fastest way is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to the satellite, same as you would any astral body.
I mean, the satellite’s not super old, but it’s hardly brand-new. “Ol’” is more a term of affection. ...You’re being very literal-minded about this.
Ol’ Spacey likes visitors, you know! Fastest way to find it is to jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to our faithful satellite friend, same as you would any astral body.
Yeah, um, the one that’s standard with all our spacesuits? The one you have with you at all times that opens with the press of a button? …That map?
You didn’t get conked on the head by a rock or a meteorite or something on your way here, did you? No shame in that. Happens to me all the time!
In case you were hit especially hard, don’t forget that you can jump into your ship and use your solar system map to lock on to any astral body. It’s the easiest way to visit Ol’ Spacey, too.
No worries. Feel free to let me know when you do find something cool, though. You know where to find me.
I was hoping you’d be back - something really weird is going on.
Me
Do you think we’re in a time loop?
We’re definitely in a time loop.
Gabbro
Yeah, a time loop makes the most sense, right? Or at least, it’s some kind of fidgety time business. Hard to say what’s happening to the shape of time, exactly, but let’s go with “loop” for now.
Oh. Yeah, that makes sense. Cool.
Me
You’re taking this pretty well.
What did you think it was?
Gabbro
Heh, right back at you. Personally, I like new experiences, and I’ve never been in a time loop before.
Well. I don’t think I’ve been in a time loop before this one, but then, it’s not like I can know that for sure.
I figured it’d be some kind of fidgety time business, but I wasn’t really thinking about what’s happening to the shape of time, you know? But a loop makes sense here. Let’s go with “loop” for now.
So it looks like you and I are the only ones who know we’re in a time loop. And even if you tell them about it, no one remembers by the next loop. What’s with that?
Maybe it’s because we both made some seriously intense eye contact with a Nomai statue?
I’m seeing my memories replay each time I die, just like I did when the Nomai statue on the beach opened its eyes and looked at me. So maybe... no glowing statue, no time loop awareness?
I think that’s going to be my leading theory, but if you find out anything new about the statues or the time loop, let me know, okay? I’ll be here.
Hey, my time buddy’s back!
So what’s new?
Well, what are any of us doing here, really?
...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you.
But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.

If it isn’t my time buddy! How’s space treating you this loop?
Heyo, time buddy. It’s a good thing I never get bored of rain, huh?
You know, I kind of wish I’d built a hammock here before we ended up in this time loop.
A few loops ago, a cyclone came by and tossed my little island into space. Dying like that was kind of unpleasant.
Hello again. ...Again.
What’s up?
Me
How do you stay so calm in the face of repeated impending death?
Gabbro
Deep breaths... no, seriously, I meditate.
Want me to teach you? It'll be the next loop before you know it.
Me
Sure, why not.
Nah, I'm good.
Gabbro
Ok, close your eyes...
Ok, let me know if you change your mind. Time flies when you're in a deep, meditative trance.
Well, what are any of us doing here, really?
...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you.

Gabbro here, checking in on the deep space satellite per ground control's request to check out a possible equipment problem. See, Hornfels? I do too work!
You know, I wouldn’t mind being a satellite. It's peaceful out here, among the distant stars and the soft, velvety darkness… Bet it's (yawn) awfully nice for naps, too...
...
Oh, right. The lens.
Alright, little satellite, let's see what the trouble is.
...Huh. Everything looks a-okay, ground control. No dust or scratches on the lens, and no evidence of sparking or violent explosions. Guess that rules out an equipment malfunction, after all.
Hear that, pal? You’re in great shape. Keep up the good work out here!

CLOSED DUE TO FIRE DAMAGE
The old radio tower, while an important landmark, is unfortunately closed thanks to the unsanctioned flight testing of an extremely powerful model rocket.
While we hope to repair the radio tower in the future, all construction efforts are currently focused on the planned museum expansion at the Observatory.
Sincerest apologies, except to Slate and Mica,

Hornfels (museum curator)
The radio tower here on Timber Hearth was built to receive transmissions from our deep space satellite, and to this day still houses the first-ever photos taken of the entire solar system.
These photos were made possible by the deep space satellite’s unusual vertical orbit that carries it high above (and below) the plane of the solar system.
Thanks to a recent upgrade, the deep space satellite is now responsible for generating the real-time solar system map used by our newest astronauts.
Our new expansion was made possible by the generous contributions of esteemed museum visitors like you. Thank you very much for your support!
FUTURE SITE OF OUR NEXT EXHIBIT!
If you’ve enjoyed your time with Outer Wilds, please consider supporting our planned museum expansion.
Our quest to explore the furthest reaches of our solar system wouldn’t be possible without generous visitors like you! We thank you profusely for your support, and we hope to see you again soon.

Slate
Slate
There’s our pilot! Back from your pre-launch campout under the stars, I see.
So it’s Launch Day, eh? Seems like only yesterday you joined the space program, and suddenly here you are, leaving on your first solo voyage.
What do you say - ready to get this beauty off the ground? It’s all fueled up and ready to go!
Me
All systems go!
I’m ready if you are.
You’re sure you fixed the retro rockets?
Slate
Hey, you ready to get this thing off the ground? Ship’s all fueled and ready to go.
Me
Did... did I just... die?
All systems go!
I’m ready if you are.
You’re sure you fixed the retro rockets?
Slate
Whoa, bad dream or something? You still look half asleep, but that’s a negative on being deceased.
I know it’s tradition to sleep out under the stars the night before a launch, but if you ask me it makes you all a bit jumpy.
Glad you’re excited, but remember, if you wreck the ship I’m not building you a new one. I’m not made of lightweight reentry grade aluminum alloys, you know.
Are you kidding? Of course I’m ready - it’s finally time to test the new landing hydraulics with a pilot instead of the autoflight system!
...Speaking of pilots, make sure you don’t crash the ship the first time you put it down, you hear?
That was only a problem one time. And then maybe a few times after that, but hey, no reason to dwell on the past, right?
Anyway, you’ll need to get the launch codes from Hornfels at the observatory before you can lift off. Just bring those here once you’ve said your goodbyes or whatever.
Not having second thoughts, are you?
Me
Where are the launch codes again?
How’s the ship looking?
How safe would you say this thing is?
What’s my mission once I’m in space?
What else should I do before liftoff?
Slate
Hey, you’re the pilot - you tell me. Aren’t you pilot-types all eager to get up there and explore for yourselves?
Doesn’t matter if you go to the moon or Brittle Hollow or just the other side of Timber Hearth. It’s all the same to me. Get out there and have fun!
Just don’t hurt the ship, that’s all I ask.
If you have any goodbyes to say, better say ’em now. I think your friend Hal is in the observatory waiting to see you off.
Oh, and Gossan says they have the zero-g chamber set up if you want a refresher on making ship repairs in space. Not saying you have to, but uh, it’d help get Gossan off my back if you did.
Hornfels has the launch codes. Should be up at the observatory, like usual. I’m starting to think they live there.
Great! Hey, you might get a kick out of this - I’ve repurposed the spare oxygen tank to be used as an extra combustion chamber!
Me
What does that do?
Is that... safe?
Slate
Well, it’s all very conceptual, but basically, it’s like taking a regular second-stage booster and strapping a bigger rocket onto it.
Isn’t that great?
Probably!
Oh, it’s a perfect ten. Unless you’re factoring in pilot error, in which case it’s about a four.
No offense.
Oh, hold up, you’re going to want to get the launch codes from the observatory first.
Me
I already got them from the observatory, remember?
How did I get back here? Didn’t I already lift off?
Wait, did I just die, or...?
Slate
Huh. Must be inhaling more fumes than I realized. That stuff is potent.
Well, if you’ve got the codes, I’m not gonna stop you. Good luck, and take care of that ship!
Trust me -- with the modifications I’ve made to those rockets? There’s no way I would have missed that.
I won’t ask how you got the launch codes, but since you have ’em, get a move on! I want to see whether the new cockpit stays attached during liftoff.
Uh, no...? You have a bad dream or something?
I won’t ask how you got the codes, so hurry up and launch before Hornfels decides to ground you for medical reasons. I want to see whether the new cockpit stays attached during liftoff.
Looks like you’re ready for takeoff! The excitement of a launch is fun and all, but I can’t wait to get back to working on the new ship.
We’re working on fixing the autopilot’s avoidance system for this one!
...Uh, sorry.
There’s our pilot! Ready to get this beauty off the ground?
Hey, what can I do you for?
Me
You know the ship is a death-trap, right?
You’re lucky I’m in a time loop, because otherwise I’d be super dead.
The autopilot flew my ship directly into the sun!
I keep getting killed by ghost matter.
The sun is going to go supernova, by the way.
Did you know it’s just an endless void outside our solar system?
Slate
Well yeah, it’s a death-trap, but a really powerful death trap. What, you suddenly care about safety now?
And you’re lucky I don’t have you grounded for medical reasons, because I have no idea what you’re talking about.
Had an exciting dream, did you?
It’s not exactly impossible for the autopilot to get you too close to the sun, but it’s not like it’ll try to take you there on purpose.
Make sure the sun isn’t between you and your destination when you engage autopilot, and you’ll be fine.
Not if you use your scout to detect it, you won’t, you dumb idiot! Did you think I made that just so you could take pretty little pictures of trees? It has multiple uses!
You do know you can use it as a light source, right? Stars above, please tell me you knew that.
Oh yeah, the observatory has an exhibit about that.
Between you and me, I glossed over some of the finer details. Astrophysics is really more Hornfels’s domain.
Me, I’m here for the rocket science and the marshmallows.
Yeah, I’d stick to exploring our solar system, if I were you. As much as I hate to admit it, our ships aren’t deep-space-worthy.
Hey, hold up a sec!
Me
Yeah yeah yeah, I already know about the launch codes.
Slate
What? No, I was going to tell you about using the ship log to set destination markers for locations you’ve visited before.
It’s a brilliant feature, if I say so myself. Dead useful. And the risk it poses of shorting out the fuel regulator and causing the ship to explode is so minimal that only Gossan would worry about it.
Me
Wait, so how do I use it?
Use the ship log to mark a location I want to revisit. Got it.
How minimal are we talking?
What about locations I haven’t visited before?
Slate
When you’re on your ship, open up its log to the location you want to mark. Anywhere’s fine, as long as you’ve been there at least once.
Hop in the pilot seat, and the ship will throw up a destination marker on your display. It’s that easy.
Minimal! Stars above, you worry too much. If anything’s going to kill you, it’s the autopilot.
Oh, sure, I’ll just magically have the system know all the possible locations you plan to discover throughout the entire solar system, shall I?
“Wow, Slate! How do you come up with these incredible ideas?” Oh, I do the best I can with what I’ve got. Really, you’re too kind.
Me
Slate, you are a technological marvel.
This was extraordinarily convenient timing. Thanks!
That’s not what my voice sounds like.
Slate
...Whoa, say that again! Please? That sounds so good when it’s not sarcastic.
Sure thing, hatchling!
Everyone’s a critic.
Anyway, I’ve got a fire to enjoy, and you’ve got launch codes to grab. Go wild with the marking feature while you're out there. Just, uh, try not to follow it so directly you fly into the sun, okay?

Feldspar
Feldspar
Whoa!
Where’d you come from? No one’s come here in... well, ever, actually. That makes you the second Hearthian to ever reach Dark Bramble — after me, of course. Well done!
...Say, it’s you! They made you an astronaut? And you haven’t blown yourself up yet, good for you!
Me
Let me guess: anglerfish?
Feldspar! You’re alive!
We all thought you were dead for sure.
Have you been here in Dark Bramble all this time?
Feldspar
...You never were the brightest hatchling, were you.
Yeah, that’s right, I’m alive. Been camping out here since my ship, uh, y’know. Crashed. Violently.
Me
Wait, what?
You crashed? But you’re the greatest pilot in Hearthian history!
Feldspar
I haven’t lived in polite society for a while, so I’m just going to go ahead and assume that wasn’t sarcasm.
What! Me, killed off by thorny, extradimensional plants that entirely violate the laws of space and time, and a couple of giant predatory fish with gaping maws and enormously sharp fangs? Not in this lifetime, little buddy.
I set up camp here when my ship got stuck here in Dark Bramble. Been living off the land ever since.
Me
So what exactly happened to your ship?
"Got stuck"? But aren’t you the greatest pilot in Hearthian history?
Feldspar
Depends on how long "all this time" is. I’ve been here a while, I guess. Ever since I crashed my ship into — that is, ever since my daring escape from the jaws of an anglerfish!
Me
Tell me more about your flying prowess!
You crashed your ship, didn’t you.
Feldspar
Haha, you flatter me! ...I like it!
Obviously, yes. No need to be rude.
...well, like I said, I crash. Blammo! On impact, my ship starts making noises like it’s coming apart from the inside, and I think, well, that ain’t great. Sure enough, I barely get out of there before the electrical systems start sparking like crazy.
It’s either move fast or die unpleasantly, so I had to put a little distance between me and my poor, fried ship.
I camped out near where I crashed at first. I found this skeleton later — great find, would’ve been stupid not to use it.
So I moved my setup over here and planted my emergency tree seeds. Been here ever since!
Me
...Wow.
I can’t believe you didn’t die.
I can’t believe you destroyed your ship.
No wonder there are so many stories about you back home!
Feldspar
My story goes like this. I’d just finished exploring the core of Giant’s Deep, and I wanted to try my hand at Dark Bramble, seeing as no one had ever been before.
Getting around in Dark Bramble was easy, mind you. Once you’ve dodged one massive, interdimensional vine bristling with thorns, you’ve dodged ’em all.
But after a while, I run into this huge anglerfish — you’ve seen ’em? Big gnarly things, and this was the biggest one I’ve ever seen. I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off — nothing too fancy. I’m going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and...
Oh, this is a good story. I’d just finished exploring the core of Giant’s Deep and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever been inside Dark Bramble, so I think, hey, let’s give that a try.

I came to Dark Bramble for the excitement. I’d just finished exploring the core of Giant’s Deep and needed a new challenge, and none of us had ever gone farther than Dark Bramble’s ice fields, so I thought, hey, let’s give it a try.

I pull a few stunts, try to shake the thing off — nothing too fancy. I’m going full-speed when the fish clips me, knocks me into a vine, and...
Yeah, pretty much.
You know, in the old days, I used to think the same thing every time I came back from a flight in one piece.
These days, I’m used to it.
Easy for you to say. Your ship probably has all kinds of fancy modifications and upgrades, like "working retro boosters" and "non-flammable construction materials."
Heh. You’re not half-bad yourself, making it here in one piece.
Anyway, that’s how it all went down, hatchling!
Story’s over, but feel free to stay and enjoy the fire a while.
Or don’t. Fire’s not going anywhere.
Heh, you got it in one. Kind of hard not to, once you’ve seen one of those fish up close and personal-like.
Well, take a load off and refill your oxygen tank, hatchling! There’s plenty of fire to go around.
Anything else you wanted?
Me
I found something!
Where should I explore here?
You reached the core of Giant’s Deep? How’d you do it?
Where’s your ship?
What happened to this anglerfish?
Shouldn’t I tell ground control to come get you?
Nah, I’m good.
Feldspar
Hey, hatchling, pull up a marshmallow stick!
Come to hear tales of my heroic exploits, have you?
Me
I found something!
Where should I explore here?
You reached the core of Giant’s Deep? How’d you do it?
Where’s your ship?
What happened to this anglerfish?
Shouldn’t I tell ground control to come get you?
Nah, I’m good.
Feldspar
Oh, the skeleton? It was like this when I got here.
As near as I can tell, this anglerfish must have been chewing on the vine and eaten a seed, and then the seed grew and grew in the poor fish’s stomach until... this happened.
Gross, huh?
This skeleton was a good find. Keeps the fish away. See, they’re territorial, so they mostly avoid each other. That’s why I set up camp here.
Giant’s Deep’s core, huh? Ahhh, that was a wild one.
But since you’re asking, I gotta assume you haven’t made it down there yourself yet, right? If I tell you how, it kinda feels like cheating.
Hm...
...On a completely unrelated note, that sure was a big, hollow vine my ship crashed into. Yep.
If I were you, I’d go take a walk and see where it ends.
You’ll want to go to the tail end of this anglerfish skeleton here and look for a flickering light in the fog — that’ll be my old ship. Path starts there.
If you change your mind, you know where to find me!
Well... yeah, sure, whenever you have the time.
Frankly, I kinda like it out here. Quiet, peaceful...ish.
You’re a little young to understand, but it’s a lot of pressure, being the best that ever was. Been nice to have a break.
That’s the spirit!
Anywhere’s good, but you should know that space is weird here. Intensely.
Ever tried throwing your scout into one of these weird seeds? See there, with the little opening? It’s just big enough to launch one through.
Your scout tracker will tell you the scout is in two places at once, but I don’t think that’s... wrong, exactly, because space doesn’t work right in here. That seed looks small, see? But inside, it’s bigger.
Much bigger.
I’ve had a lot of time to think about this, and my theory is space in Dark Bramble kind of expands as you go through each sphere. That’s why it’s bigger inside those seeds.
Well, that’s my theory. Keep that in mind while you’re exploring Dark Bramble and maybe you won’t get lost inside forever.
Good luck!
Not far from here, as a matter of fact! If you go straight past the tail of this anglerfish skeleton here, you’ll see a flickering light in the fog.
Follow that, and you’ll find my old ship. What’s left of it, anyway.
Lay it on me, hatchling!
Me
I went to the core of Giant’s Deep.
I found the frozen jellyfish near your ship.
I found the Anglerfish nest.
I found a Dark Bramble seed on Timber Hearth.
I found Nomai writing saying anglerfish are blind.
I found a Nomai shuttle and flew it!
Actually, nevermind.
Feldspar
So you figured out the ol’ tornado trick, did you? Good work!
I found that bit out by accident, but let’s keep that between you and me, hey? Hornfels would have my very handsome head if they knew I’d been riding the cyclones again.
"The ship is fragile! It can break! You can’t subject it to extreme conditions!" Not like I was flying the thing into the sun, now, was I?
And the jellyfish, you figured those out, too? Hatchling, I tell you what, you’ve done real well for yourself! You’re a fine astronaut, sure, but you might just become a pilot yet!
Ha! So the old thing still there, is it? That’s where I first camped out after the crash, you know. It was pretty cozy inside!
It does lack the structural integrity and indomitable spirit of a camp made in the shelter of the very bones of the species that tried to eat you, I suppose.
Still. Very cozy.
So that’s where the blasted things come from, is it? Stars above, if I still had a working ship, I’d be sorely tempted to go show ’em what’s what!
Sigh...
Probably best to leave ’em alone, though, really. More trouble than it’s worth to mess with anglerfish.
...That’s bad business, hatchling.
As Chert will tell you if you so much as glance in Dark Bramble’s direction, there used to be a fifth planet where the Bramble is now.
This infernal plant appeared at the center and kept growing, and growing, and growing, until it shattered the planet and scattered its pieces across space.
If we don’t get that seed you found sorted real quicklike, I suspect Timber Hearth will be heading toward the same fate. And I tell you what, we Hearthians have overcome far too much to be done in by some worthless seed.
A-ha! So the blasted things do have a weakness!
Meaning my fly-as-fast-as-I-can approach to dealing with them could have used a bit more thought behind it.
Ah, well, at least they didn’t eat me. All’s well that ends well, eh, hatchling?
You flew a Nomaian shuttle? You don’t say! How was it? How did it handle?
Can’t say I’d mind having a go at that myself, hatchling. Once I return to Timber Hearth, maybe that’ll have to be my next stop.
A brand-new astronaut, and you’re already a pro adventurer! Outer Wilds Ventures is in good hands with you, I can tell. The flight program is going places!
Nothing you want to share with me? Sounds like you’d better get out there and start exploring!
Journal
Despite my checking on them at least a thousand times over, the images are STILL not ready to print over in the radio tower. Well, it’s like they say — a watched satellite never transmits data! (Haha, that’s a little joke for you, journal. No one says that.)
Someday, I’ll have to study the mechanics of how time manages to slow to a syrupy crawl whenever I’m anticipating something. In the meantime, I’ve turned to Gabbro, our resident expert in leisurely whiling away the hours, who recommends the following:
GABBRO’S 3 FOOLPROOF STEPS FOR DOZING OFF
1. Light a nice, cozy campfire and get comfortable.
2. Gaze deeply into the serene warmth.
3. Let time begin to slip away as you allow the flames to lull you into a peaceful slumber.
(If Gabbro knew I’d taken notes, they’d probably think I’d finally cracked, but I refuse to accept sass from an astronaut who deliberately burns their marshmallows.)
Charting stars again out by the radio tower — they’re so bright out here! I only wish I were able to record them faster. Admittedly, I could use more patience. I get so engrossed in my work that sunrise becomes an unwelcome deadline, and daylight a grating slog.
Recording
...Aaand we’re recording! Ahem. It’s been two days since the launch of the deep space satellite, and I’m about to view the first batch of photos. Let the record show that on this historic day, Outer Wilds Ventures has—
Aaaah! They’re printing, they’re printing! Here they come!
…Stars above, will you look at that. There’s Brittle Hollow. And look, look there, that’s Hollow’s Lantern! And there’s Giant’s Deep, and — and the Quantum Moon! I’m speechless, completely speechless.
Every single astral body in our magnificent solar system, looking stunning from every angle in each of these three images. And in color, no less! Now this is art. I could stare at these photos forever. Doesn’t Timber Hearth look tiny from —
Hold on. What is that?
That can’t be right. That’s… I mean, that’s not even possible. Am I interpreting this photo correctly? What’s even stranger is it doesn’t show up in either of the other photos. Just this one…
Well, there must have been an equipment malfunction, I suppose. Only sensible explanation for it. I’ll radio Gabbro and ask them to go examine the satellite’s lens for defects.

the Prisoner
Prisoner
This fire… what a warm and beautiful light it makes.
Go, find the others. What comes next cannot be done alone.
I hadn’t dared to hope that anyone would hear the signal, for how briefly I set it free… Yet, here we are. Are you ready for the final step?
Me
Yes.
Not yet.
Prisoner
Then it’s time! Time to send our spark out into the darkness.
I have awaited this moment for a long time. For so long. It is no trouble to wait a little longer.
...How beautiful. It’s different than I’d envisioned.
Whatever happens next, I do not think it is to be feared.
When my kind found the Eye and realized what it was capable of, they were terrified. It was too difficult a truth. Like a light too bright to look upon directly, it burned them.
What they could not unlearn was hidden away in darkness — obfuscated, then lost. They did not want to see their story end.
My kind weren’t always like this. We weren’t always so afraid. I did what I could to set things right, yet I am still of my kind, and you know now what they did. I cannot promise our fear won’t stain your mind.
And so, a choice: Are you certain you want to remember me?
Me
Join us. Let’s see what happens.
Your journey is over now. You did well.
I’m not ready to decide.
Prisoner
I don’t want to repeat my kind’s mistakes. But if you’re willing to take the risk, then so am I.
My role in this ended long ago, and now I’ve learned my efforts weren’t in vain. Thank you for facing what was hidden in the dark.
Every decision is made in darkness. Only by making a choice can we learn whether it was right or not.
I will wait until you are ready.
...
Me
Who are you?
Where are we?
Prisoner

Exhibit
The radio tower on Timber Hearth was built to receive transmissions from our deep space satellite, and housed some of the last-ever photos taken of the entire solar system.
Hornfels noticed a curious anomaly in one of the photos, but it ultimately went unexplained.
The radio tower on Timber Hearth was built to receive transmissions from our deep space satellite, and housed some of the last-ever photos taken of the entire solar system.
One of these photos revealed the existence of an invisible ring world inhabited by a species whose presence in our solar system predated even the Nomai.
This species traveled from a nearby star system in search of the Eye of the universe, but, horrified by what they discovered, decided to block the Eye’s signal so that no one else would ever find it.
One individual, however, rebelled against the decision, and was able to briefly release the Eye’s signal back into space before being caught and imprisoned in solitude for this betrayal.
Cassava
CASSAVA: Conoy, Daz and I were lifting Orbital Probe Cannon components into orbit for assembly, and one somehow sank down down beneath the current.
Daz
DAZ: Cassava convinced me not to try to recreate the phenomenon myself using other cannon parts, but we’re very curious to know what happened! How could something pass through the current?
Conoy
CONOY: My gratitude for your interesting question! This is exciting: Spire constructed a model of Giant's Deep here at Brittle Hollow's Southern Observatory, and it reveals how an object might sink below the current.
Cassava
CASSAVA: Conoy, I’m unable to grasp the answer by looking through the projection pool. If I visit the observatory, would you kindly explain?
Conoy
CONOY: If you don’t mind the trek beneath the surface to the south pole, I’d be delighted to see you! (There are two trailheads, one at Brittle Hollow's gravity cannon and one at the Tower of Quantum Knowledge.)
Daz
DAZ: Conoy, you should’ve seen it! We’d thought it was impossible for any cannon components to sink even partially below the current, but ours sank straight to the core!
Coleus
COLEUS: I was upstairs testing the Eye signal locator, and it can hear and follow the signals from the sun, Giant’s Deep, and Brittle Hollow.
COLEUS: However, something strange is happening when I ask the Eye signal locator to follow the Eye’s signal: The device’s indicator rotates wildly and never points to just one direction.
Thatch
THATCH: This is a curious result. It’s possible the Eye has stopped calling out its signal.
Filix
FILIX: I see! I most likely calibrated the locator incorrectly. Privet (my apprentice) and I will make adjustments and try again.
FILIX: An update: Disappointingly, everything is correctly calibrated after all.
Cassava
CASSAVA: It saddens me to posit this, my friends, but I believe this locator cannot detect the Eye’s signal. We would need to build a more sensitive device if we want to locate the Eye of the universe.
Thatch
THATCH: Then we will build it. Don’t lose hope, Cassava; our search for the Eye is what brought our clan to this place. We won’t give up so easily!

Hal
Hey, hey, it’s my favorite astronaut! Launch day at last, huh, buddy? It’s the translator tool’s inaugural flight, too! I’m so excited it’s making me nauseous.
Just think - you’ll be able to translate any Nomai text you want, anywhere you are. The two of us put a lot of hours into inventing that tool, so don’t break it, okay? Haha! ...Oh, geez. Do not break it.
...Ugh, ignore me, okay? I’m just nervous. And I’m not even the one going into space! How are you feeling?
Me
I’m excited!
I’m terrified!
Hal
Good! You’ve only been waiting for this day since we were hatchlings. I can’t wait to see all your training pay off!
Aw, don’t let me make you nervous. You’ve been training for this day since we were hatchlings, remember? You’ll do great, I promise!
So what’s the dirt? You here to see the new Nomai statue?
Me
New statue?
Of course!
Just here for the launch codes.
Hal
Heh, I knew you’d want to see it before you headed off! Hornfels just finished prepping it for display today. Amazing, isn’t it?
You haven’t heard? Gabbro brought it back with them from Giant’s Deep, and Hornfels just finished prepping it for display. This is it right here. Neat, huh?
Yeah, I get that you’re dying to head out into space, but seriously, you’ve got to see this statue before you go. It’s an amazing find!
Makes me wish we could see what a real live Nomai looks like, but I guess this is as close as we’ll ever get. Check it out - looks like they had fur! Fur is weird.
This is the first fully intact statue ever found, you know. And for how old it is, it’s in great shape!
...Ah geez, I got a little carried away there. Go on, you have a ship to launch! Take care of yourself out there, you hear?
Hey, I was just about to come find you! Look look look, you’ve gotta see this — the Nomai statue’s eyes are open!
They, uh, used to be closed. Probably should’ve started with that. And now they’ve opened!
We’re not sure why they opened, since no one actually saw it happen, but this is huge news!
Should someone tell Gabbro? Or maybe Riebeck? Oh, stars, this is so exciting, it’s making my stomach hurt!
Me
Hal! Can you help me translate this new alien language I found?
Hal
A new language?! YES! Absolutely! Stars above, you BET I can!
Just give me… let’s call it a hundred samples, some form of epigraphical codex, and six months, and I should have the vague gist of the sort of graphemes this new language is working with!
Gosh, I can’t wait to get started!
Hey again! What’s up?
Me
Where on Giant’s Deep would I find Gabbro?
Where did this statue come from?
Why did the Nomai make this statue?
Think I’ll discover anything cool in space?
Sorry, nevermind.
Hal
Was there something else?
Me
Where’d you say this statue came from?
Where can I find Gabbro?
Why did the Nomai make this statue?
Think I’ll discover anything cool in space?
Nope, that was it.
Hal
Good question! So Gabbro found this fully intact statue on Giant’s Deep, right? Well, Hornfels told me it’s made from the same type of special stone as the partial statue Chert brought back from the Hourglass Twins.
That’s why when Gabbro, you know, chipped the Giant’s Deep statue, that stone fragment was repurposed for your ship’s computer.
Maybe the statues were made for storing information?
From Giant’s Deep! Gabbro fished it out of the oceans and brought it back here for study.
Hornfels doesn’t know much about it yet, just that it’s crazy old and super tough. I wonder why the Nomai carved it?
Apparently, Gabbro went back to Giant’s Deep to try to learn more about the statue. Maybe they’ll find some answers there.
Hey, you never know — maybe you’ll be the one to solve the mysteries of the Nomai!
Or maybe you’ll discover a new kind of rock or something.
But honestly, as long as they don’t end up naming new safety equipment after you, I’m sure you’ll have done a great job.
No problem. Take it easy!
Alright then! Be careful out there, okay?
Gabbro said they were going back to Giant’s Deep to wherever they found that Nomai statue. One of the islands, I think.
You remember Gabbro plays a flute, right? Like, all the time? I bet your signalscope could find them easily.
If you do see Gabbro, say hi for me!
Annona
ANNONA: The Quantum Moon locator is functioning. We have markers for each of the places the moon goes.
Melorae
MELORAE: Annona, Bur, I just observed the Quantum Moon in orbit around Dark Bramble.
Annona
ANNONA: You have keen eyes, my friend. So this moon travels to a total of five locations, not four.
Bur
BUR: I added a marker for Dark Bramble.
BUR: I thought the locator now accounted for all of the phantom moon’s locations, but sometimes the locator can’t tell where the moon is. Perhaps there’s a problem with the device?
Melorae
MELORAE: It’s also possible there exists a sixth place in this star system to which the phantom moon travels.
Melorae: If you’ve come here to look for Coleus, this is where we were when he vanished. He’s been missing for two days now!
Annona
Annona: Your strange, wandering rock friend is here, though Coleus isn’t.
Melorae
Melorae: Coleus and I observed this unusual-looking rock shard (and several smaller rocks) in at least two other caverns. I’m unsure if this is relevant.
Bur
BUR: What happened before Coleus disappeared?
Melorae
Melorae: We were examining the different rocks. I recall Coleus standing on the largest one (the wandering rock). I was taking notes, and then my lantern died.
Melorae: When I lit it again, Coleus and the rock were both gone.
Unknown Nomai
Should we build the Sun Station to power the Ash Twin Project?
Idaea
IDAEA: I almost can’t comprehend this is being suggested seriously. The purpose of the Sun Station goes against every standard we hold ourselves to and everything we believe in as a species!
Pye
PYE: Unsurprisingly, Idaea, I disagree. We’re pushing a possible new technology further than ever before. That, in my experience, is the defining characteristic of our species.
Yarrow
YARROW: Are there other ways to generate this level of power?
Pye
PYE: Theoretically, yes. Practically, no. I can’t imagine discovering them in our lifetimes...
Ramie
RAMIE: I understand this proposal is unsettling, but the Sun Station must be built if we hope to complete the Ash Twin Project.
Coleus
COLEUS: If we fail (and the probability of this is not insignificant), we will without question destroy ourselves, all life here, and the rest of this star system. I wish to protect these species.
Idaea
IDAEA: The potential annihilation of an entire star system is too severe a cost. We shouldn’t build the Sun Station, no matter how badly we want the knowledge that comes with it.
Poke
POKE: Fear of failure is a poor reason not to try. I believe, if we’re cautious, the Sun Station will work. I believe in Pye.
Pye
PYE: Poke, I’m deeply honored. Idaea, I comprehend your position; however, if we aren’t all but certain the Sun Station will not cause destruction once we’ve built it, then I won’t support the station’s use.
Ramie
RAMIE: Note: This door will need to remain closed for some time! Pye and I are running an experiment based on the extraordinary findings from the White Hole Station.
Pye
PYE: Ramie and I will be running this experiment until one of us (specifically, me) can prove the other wrong, so although it’s inconvenient, the lab currently can only be accessed by the path from the Sunless City.
Ramie
RAMIE: Inviting sand inside would disrupt our setup and could have enormous consequences. (We realize this is an intriguing prospect, but the door must remain closed nonetheless!)
RAMIE: An update: The High Energy Lab is now being used to design the Ash Twin Project! If you’re here to help (or even just to observe), be sure to use the Sunless City path to the lab.
RAMIE: The Southern Observatory is asking if creating a 22 minute interval is possible (that is, to have something arrive 22 minutes before it is actually sent through the warp).
RAMIE: We’ve learned the negative interval of time between departure and arrival can be increased by adding more energy to the warp core. Problematically, the energy required to extend the interval increases at an exponential rate.
Pye
PYE: Hypothesis: Creating a 22-minute-long interval is possible, but we are currently unable to generate the necessary energy.
PYE: Ramie and I believe it would be necessary to invent a new method of producing energy, a thrilling but enormous undertaking. We would also require advanced warp technology able to handle such energy.
PYE: We would also likely need an enormous space to fit these proposed new energy and warp technologies together. The only location large enough would be Ash Twin.
Ramie
RAMIE: The energy is currently unavailable, you say? You’re a gas, Pye!
Pye
PYE: My pun was unintended, Ramie, so I believe it’s you who’s aeriform!
PYE: Records show Nomai arriving at the warp receiver on Brittle Hollow very slightly before departing from the White Hole Station. Ramie and I are devising an experiment to test if this is a real phenomenon or simple machine error.
Ramie
RAMIE: In theory, what we want to try to reproduce is a negative amount of time elapsing between something entering the black hole and exiting the white hole at its destination.
Pye
PYE: Initial things first: Our experiment setup will first pair a small black hole core with a small white hole core to mimic the setup on the White Hole Station.
Ramie
RAMIE: Hypothesis: It is possible for an object to exit a white hole before entering the corresponding black hole.
RAMIE: An update: Our experiment here reproduced the anomaly in arrival and departure times, but Pye is unconvinced it’s more than an equipment error. I hope to strengthen the effect to render it visible to the unaided eyes.
Pye
PYE: To that end, we’ve decided to try adding more energy. I imagine the Sunless City’s energy supply should prove sufficient.
PYE: Of note, Ramie: Yarrow requests that we let him know before we reroute energy to the experiment.
Ramie
RAMIE: I’d hate to leave him in the dark!
Pye
PYE: All available energy has been rerouted from the city to our experiment. Ramie and I are about to run a new test.
Ramie
RAMIE: Hypothesis confirmed! Hypothesis confirmed! I saw it! Pye saw it! Hypothesis confirmed!
Pye
PYE: This is beyond extraordinary! This changes everything! What a beautiful day for the intersection of abstract theory and practical application!
Secca
SECCA: Our escape pod crashed as we tried to flee this place, destroying our movement and communication capabilities in the process.
SECCA: We’ve held out as long as we could here, but this pod’s supply of breathable air is nearly depleted, and the anglerfish attack more and more frequently.
SECCA: Our best chance at survival is to return to the Vessel to either repair the damage or, more probably, await rescue.
Escall
ESCALL: Secca, is the message finished? The Vessel’s beacon is already growing fainter; it will be gone in a matter of hours. We need to leave here, quickly.
Canna
CANNA: To any Nomai clans whose Vessels can hear this message:
CANNA: It’s clear the universe is dying. There are fewer and fewer resources and safe places within space now, so my clan and I believe the best option is for all of our clans to stay together.
CANNA: If you can reach the Gloaming Galaxy, we’ve found that Blackrock’s suns are fairly stable, and life in this star system is (comparatively) thriving. We live in relative safety.
CANNA: If you prefer to continue exploring alone, know you will be on your own.
Bromi
BROMI: Canna, we’re making our way to you.
Canna
CANNA: It’s good to hear from you, Bromi! We’ll watch for your Vessel.
CANNA: Has anyone heard from Neem? His clan was on its way to our Vessel, but they never arrived, and he hasn’t sent any messages. I’m beginning to worry.
Bromi
BROMI: That is unsettling. It reminds me of that old myth my grandfather used to tell, the Disappearance of Escall.
Clem
CLEM: I remember hearing that story as a child! One day, Escall’s Vessel simply stopped responding. The other clans searched and searched, but found no trace. It was as if their missing friends had warped out of existence.
Hyssop
HYSSOP: That’s no myth, friends; Escall’s clan existed, and their story was real.
Bromi
BROMI: What a curious event to have passed into myth! Our ancestors’ ancestors were told that story when they were young. Are you sure it’s true, Hyssop?
Hyssop
HYSSOP: It was a very long time ago, but yes. My clan’s ancestors searched for Escall’s clan for a long time, but in the end, none of them were ever seen again. (It’s the only time in our history a Vessel has ever disappeared this way.)
Neem
NEEM: Hyssop, I hope you aren’t comparing Escall’s story to my clan’s Vessel!
Clem
CLEM: Neem, my friend! We feared you were gone!
Neem
NEEM: Not yet, we aren’t, but nearly. We found trouble during our warp: The triple suns of the Bright Spark star system exploded, and it was only a lucky coincidence we weren’t caught in the blast. We’ll meet you soon, Canna!
Canna
CANNA: I’m relieved your clan is safe, Neem! It’s good to hear your words. Any Vessels nearby, remember to be extremely cautious of potentially unstable stars (which is most of them, now).
Filix
FILIX: This is Escall’s Vessel; something went badly wrong during our warp, and our Vessel is mortally wounded. We need help as quickly as possible!
FILIX: Our Vessel appears to have... has it fused with the local environment, somehow? There are vines that are now part of the Vessel! It’s been torn apart from inside itself!
FILIX: We... we are abandoning our Vessel. Any Nomai clans or spaceflight-capable species receiving this message, I implore you, we need your help!
FILIX: Is this broken? Can anyone hear me? Our Vessel is dying! We need immediate assistance!
FILIX: I’m recording now — I’ve never encountered anything like this! The signal the Vessel is receiving appears to be older than the universe itself!
Escall
ESCALL: This is our first contact with anything of this nature. Everyone, prepare to warp immediately!
Filix
FILIX: Escall, wait, I need more time to send an outgoing message! Shouldn’t we tell another clan where we’re going?
Escall
ESCALL: We can send the message upon our arrival. This extraordinary signal appeared suddenly; it may disappear just as quickly, and we can’t lose a discovery this incredible! Focus on preparing for the warp, instead.
Filix
FILIX: I understand!
Escall
ESCALL: Annona, is the Vessel ready to warp to the signal’s approximate coordinates?
Annona
ANNONA: The warp core is powered, but this will be a significant jump. Afterward, we’ll need time to recharge the core.
Escall
ESCALL: That shouldn’t create a problem, provided we arrive at or near the signal’s source. Everyone, we’re ready to warp!
Cassava
CASSAVA: This is it: We’ve finished building the final Orbital Probe Cannon module and are ready to send it into orbit around Giant’s Deep for assembly!
CASSAVA: To all my friends here at the Construction Yard, my gratitude for your tireless work. I had given up hope, but I truly believe this cannon may actually succeed where many other attempts have not.
Daz
DAZ: Are you going gelatinous on us, love? I’m delighted by your words, but they’re atypical for you!
Cassava
CASSAVA: If I’m ever half as gooey as Mallow and Avens behave together, Daz, you may launch me from the Orbital Probe Cannon.
CASSAVA: Our next step will be to send Privet up to the Orbital Probe Cannon to install the probe tracking system.
Daz
DAZ: If I know my brother, Avens (and his spouse) will want to launch the probe with as much power as possible. I’m worried the cannon would break under the strain.
DAZ: I propose we give Avens and Mallow a slightly lower maximum power setting than the absolute maximum possible to create room for their enthusiasm.

SOLANUM: We don’t know why the Quantum Moon always welcomes its visitors at the south pole, just that this is true.

Pye
PYE: Mission: Science compels us to explode the sun!
Idaea
IDAEA: Here’s a better one. Mission: Determine if it’s possible to prompt the sun to explode.
IDAEA: Can’t we change this? I don’t enjoy working in view of such a morbid mission statement.
Pye
PYE: But it’s accurate. We’re going to create a supernova for the purpose of scientific progress. That’s our mission.
Idaea
IDAEA: Our mission is to decide if such an irresponsible feat is even possible.
Pye
PYE: You lack a sense of humor.
Idaea
IDAEA: At least I don’t lack a sense of ethics!
Pye
PYE: Kindly refrain from going supernova on me before the sun does, Idaea.
Thatch
THATCH: Where should this new, more sophisticated locator be built? It may need to be larger than this Eye signal locator is.
Plume
PLUME: The southern glacier on Brittle Hollow has ample available space. I could construct a new building to house this proposed locator.
Filix
FILIX: Yes, let’s build there! I imagine our young friend Conoy would enjoy that immensely. He’s always held a great interest in the Eye, especially for a child born so long after the crash.
Plume
PLUME: I will begin construction on Brittle Hollow’s south pole immediately, then!
Coleus
COLEUS: Annona and those of us originally stranded on Ember Twin built a Quantum Moon locator there, but the heat of the sun made its construction challenging. I wouldn’t recommend building on that planet.
COLEUS: After closer observation, mining site 2a wouldn’t be safe for the native life dwelling in some of this cave’s pools, so (unfortunately) we’ll have to mine one of the other sites.
COLEUS: On the opposite hand, new life! This species is semi-aquatic, and very hardy. The ecosystem here is quite robust, so I believe they’ll thrive in the long run. Be cautious near the pools if you visit 2a to meet them.
Cycad
CYCAD: There are a few other cave sites that look promising. What about site 2b (it shares similar formations and strata)?
Oeno
OENO: This sounds promising! Will you and your mentor investigate? If mining site 2b proves safe for this native species, we’ll move our work there.
Cycad
CYCAD: Site 2b is safe! Coleus says we’ll continue to monitor our activity and its effect on life here.
CYCAD: I was watching them once during a rest, and the hours escaped from me. They’re fascinating (I wonder what their fourth eye does)!
Coleus
COLEUS: They remind me of a subterranean species that my mentor, Melorae, once told me about (from when our clan used to travel across this universe). I imagine she would have enjoyed these lifeforms greatly.
Cassava
CASSAVA: We’re nearly ready! Filix and I have finished construction, and she says calibrating the device won’t take long.
Filix
FILIX: Fortunately, the Attlerock’s lack of atmosphere will make calibration simple. After all this time, I’m thrilled to finally resume our search!

Yarrow
YARROW: Today we finished the excavation of Ash Twin. Here, in this space we carved, we will craft our most ambitious project yet: the Ash Twin Project, powerful enough to send information back in time.
Coleus
COLEUS: We’ve also finished relocating all subterranean plants we met while digging.
Ramie
RAMIE: We’ll need to keep our eyes on how significantly we’ve altered the environment here.
Pye
PYE: How far we’ve come since our experiments at the High Energy Lab! I still can hardly believe Ramie’s hypothesis was true.
Yarrow
YARROW: Poke just sent the warp core for the final tower to us from the Black Hole Forge. Now Ash Twin can be connected with Giant’s Deep, where Cassava is working with Avens to craft the Orbital Probe Cannon, and where Phlox is sculpting the memory statues.
Cassava
CASSAVA: Hypothesis: It was not by accident the core of our warp tower was the last to be forged.
Poke
POKE: Hypothesis: The cores could have been forged faster if Cassava had interrupted my work less frequently to ask for updates.
Yarrow
YARROW: The important point is we are all connected through Ash Twin now, and also that I’m no longer needed for mediating your disagreements.
YARROW: Our friends on Giant’s Deep tested the Orbital Probe Cannon today. Mallow tells me the cannon is doing well, and that Avens advocates for more launch power. If anyone can coax the maximum power from a device, Avens can.
YARROW: But then, if anyone can goad a device into exploding, that, too, is likely Avens. Perhaps I should check in with the Orbital Probe Cannon crew in the interest of safety.
YARROW: Would it help to remind Avens that Mallow (his love) will be one of the Nomai aboard the cannon, or is Mallow part of the problem?
YARROW: Pye and Idaea have worked hard on the Sun Station, and it at last is complete. If everything goes as planned, this structure will prompt the sun’s explosion, which will in turn supply the power the Ash Twin Project requires.
Ramie
RAMIE: I’m impressed by their mental fortitude. This was the project’s most difficult task, in more ways than one.
Yarrow
YARROW: We’re nearly ready to activate the Ash Twin Project! Here is what will happen: First, the Sun Station will receive the order to fire at the sun, prompting it to explode.
YARROW: Using the energy from the resulting supernova, the Ash Twin Project will send the order for the Orbital Probe Cannon to fire back in time by 22 minutes.
YARROW: Exactly 22 minutes after these orders are received, the Sun Station will again trigger the supernova to send the probe data from this cannon launch back in time.
YARROW: In total, each cycle created by the Ash Twin Project will last precisely 22 minutes. We can end this cycle at will.
YARROW: These words are difficult to write: The Sun Station did not work.
YARROW: However, this is the closest we have ever been. The Ash Twin Project is theoretically sound; we were only unable to power it. Perhaps there is another way.
Pye
PYE: Suppose we redesign the Sun Station. To generate power of that magnitude, a supernova is still our only viable option.
Idaea
IDAEA: This is easier expressed than accomplished.
Pye
PYE: You can wait for the sun to explode on its natural timeline if you prefer, Idaea, but you’ll need to find some way to halt our aging process.
Ramie
RAMIE: I believe we can still find a way to create a supernova, my friend. Don’t lose hope!
Yarrow
YARROW: We are halting our research into creating a supernova for this moment; a comet has newly arrived in this solar system, and we’re anxious to explore it.
YARROW: It’s been a very long time since we last explored somewhere new, so we’re excited to welcome this comet. Imagine what knowledge might be gained there!
Pye
PYE: Friends visiting from the Hanging City, we are planning the Ash Twin Project at the High Energy Lab on Ember Twin’s equator.
Conoy
CONOY: I became lost on Ember Twin (my gratitude that Ramie found me!), but the High Energy Lab is the building with the large solar panels. I’m suprised I didn’t see it!
Ramie
RAMIE: I imagine our otherwise immensely clever Conoy would lose his own head if it weren’t anatomically impossible!
Nomai computer
The shuttle is currently resting at the Quantum Moon.
Unknown Nomai
What is the Eye of the universe?
The Eye is the source of the signal that brought us here.
Suppose the Eye is a more advanced being.
The Eye is older than this universe, so imagine how much it could teach us.
Perhaps it is a cosmic library!
What is the Eye’s signal?
Suppose the Eye wishes to communicate.
The signal is a call. Were we the intended audience?
The signal is the Eye’s voice. It speaks a language we don’t yet know.
Or maybe the signal is the Eye’s attempt at expressing itself.
Of note: From the signal, we were able to determine the Eye’s approximate age (or perhaps its lack of age?).
Be welcomed in this place. This shrine is a space to reflect on what brought us to this star system: the signal from the Eye.
We observed the Eye’s signal in our travels, and followed it here to find its source.
What we know is this: The source of the signal (which we have chosen to call the Eye of the universe) is older than this universe itself. The rest, we have yet to learn.
Enter, and open your mind to its possibilities.
Solution 1: We could retrieve the warp core from the Vessel.
Ramie
RAMIE: The Vessel’s warp core is broken, at best (recall those present when the Vessel crashed said it sustained lethal injuries). There is no guaranteed reward for this risk.
Conoy
CONOY: Perhaps we could still repair it. My grandmother told me there was little time to assess the nature or extent of the damage.
Cassava
CASSAVA: Even if it no longer functions, the old core could be a valuable blueprint, provided we’re able to transport it back here.
Phlox
PHLOX: This would require a return to Dark Bramble. Plume (my father) said many good Nomai perished there.
Cycad
CYCAD: My mentor (Coleus) and his old mentor once discovered and studied an anglerfish fossil on Ember Twin. Using that knowledge, we could avoid the anglerfish entirely!
Coleus
COLEUS: What Melorae and I learned from that fossil would theoretically help us evade the anglerfish, but our hypothesis was never tested on a live specimen.
Ramie
RAMIE: I remember that anglerfish fossil! We used to play in Fossil Fish Cave when we were children.
Solanum
SOLANUM: I no longer believe, as I did as a child on Ember Twin, that the Eye of the universe (the source of the signal) wishes to harm us. But it may not want to be found, either.
SOLANUM: The terrible circumstances of our arrival here were almost certainly exactly that: circumstance.
SOLANUM: I suspect imagining we are special to the Eye in some way is wishful thinking. The Eye might have called out to any sentient species.
SOLANUM: Or it might not have been calling out at all, and that my ancestors heard the Eye’s signal holds no great, deep meaning.
SOLANUM: This wouldn’t be so bad, I think.
SOLANUM: In fact, the Eye may not have wishes at all. We have no evidence supporting this.
Ilex
ILEX: Why We Should Build A New Vessel
ILEX: Each Nomai clan explores the universe in its own Vessel. The Vessel is the heart of every clan.
ILEX: It’s unusual for Nomai to remain in one place for so long. Nomai are wanderers and have no permanent home.
ILEX: If we built a new Vessel, we could return to our adventurous way of life. Imagine all the new places we could go! Our clan wouldn’t be stuck here in this star system.
ILEX: We could even meet with other Nomai, and learn from them, like Coleus says we used to do.
ILEX: It probably wouldn’t be hard to get parts if we stopped building other new things, and if we broke down other structures (like the towers on Ash Twin) for parts.
ILEX: We might have to build a smaller Vessel for now, even though Vessels are normally large. But we could make it bigger later once we reach planets with more resources.
ILEX: It would also help if we stopped building so many things to search for the Eye of the universe. I asked Yarrow, and he says we use lots of resources on the Ash Twin Project.
ILEX: We could even have a warp core for jumping long distances like Vessels have. Poke tells me she plans to make a very advanced warp core for a different project. I’m sure she could connect it to the Vessel for travel (because Poke is smart).
Thatch
THATCH: Is everyone unharmed?
Plume
PLUME: No one was badly injured from the escape pod’s impact. We’re incredibly fortunate.
Thatch
THATCH: This is good news, at least. Have we heard from Escape Pod 2 or Escape Pod 3?
Filix
FILIX: No, I... I’m unable to make contact. My equipment can hear the other two escape pods’ distress signals, however. If it’s any comfort, both pods must be structurally intact.
FILIX: I’ll continue calling for them.
Thatch
THATCH: My gratitude. If we can —
Plume
PLUME: Thatch, the moon is approaching again!
Thatch
THATCH: Everyone brace yourselves, swiftly! The volcanic moon has returned!
THATCH: Be cautious of falling ash and debris!
Plume
PLUME: ...I believe the moon has passed.
Filix
FILIX: This planet doesn’t appear eager to have guests. We are certainly unwelcome on its surface.
Thatch
THATCH: We need to find shelter, and quickly. The volcanic moon won’t be gone for long.
Plume
PLUME: I observed several promising sites below the surface, but we’ll need to construct a way for everyone to climb safely down this cliff. Perhaps we could build platforms?
Conoy
CONOY: What have we learned thus far in our search for the Eye of the universe?
Plume
PLUME: Those of us on the Vessel originally followed the Eye’s signal to this star system, but we were unable to warp to the Eye itself.
Privet
PRIVET: The locator we built on the Attlerock and the new, more sensitive locator we built here were both unable to detect any trace of the Eye’s signal.
Avens
AVENS: Hypothesis: The Eye has stopped emitting its signal.
Cassava
CASSAVA: Suppose the Eye doesn’t wish to be found.
Plume
PLUME: Cassava, how can you suggest that? The Eye’s signal called out to summon us to this star system!
Cassava
CASSAVA: I’m aware; I grew up hearing the Eye’s story. Yet we’re no closer to finding it than you were when you first arrived here.
Mallow
MALLOW: Based on our knowledge of the Quantum Moon, we believe the Eye is in orbit around this star system’s sun. This would mean the Eye is located within a finite (albeit enormous) range.
Conoy
CONOY: How should our methods change as we continue our search for the Eye of the universe?
Privet
PRIVET: As we couldn’t find the Eye’s signal using two different devices built for this exact purpose, we should discontinue this search method.
Mallow
MALLOW: We know what the Eye looks like thanks to the Quantum Moon, so what if we try to find the Eye visually, instead? Let’s send out a probe!
Cassava
CASSAVA: Mallow’s idea is clever, but we have no idea where the Eye is in relation to here. The probability of launching a probe in the correct direction would be absurdly small.
Conoy
CONOY: I believe I have a solution for that problem! Have you spoken with Ramie and Pye about the technology they’re developing?
Avens
AVENS: We’d need to build a probe-launching mechanism to cover those long distances quickly. A cannon in orbit around a celestial body would circumvent the need to escape gravity’s pull.
Cassava
CASSAVA: Giant’s Deep would be a good choice. It’s furthest from the sun, so it would provide the best angles for launch. And it’s moonless (except when the Quantum Moon is visiting).
Avens
AVENS: Yes, let’s build the cannon in orbit around Giant’s Deep!
Plume
PLUME: The pain of your absence is sharp and haunting, and I would give anything not to know it; anything but never knowing you at all (which would be worse).
PLUME: I can only hope that you are safe, Keek, wherever you are.
Kousa
KOUSA: We can hear the other escape pods’ distress signals, which gives me hope. Foli, are you still here? I am unsure how to survive in this place without you.
KOUSA: (I am unsure how to be me without you.)
Plume
PLUME: My brother wasn’t in Escape Pod 1 with us. Was he in Pod 2, or Pod 3? Was he able to board an escape pod at all?
PLUME: We sacrificed too much arriving here. I cannot (I will not) allow our clan’s greatest loss to be in vain.
Thatch
THATCH: Is the hardest part of this tragedy not knowing who we may have lost? Or will the hardest part come later, when we learn? (Be well, Aunt Melorae...)
Plume
PLUME: Given concerns about our settlement’s stability, where should we construct a new, less temporary shelter?
Thatch
THATCH: We need to stay close to the escape pod so Filix can monitor incoming messages. We can’t be rescued if we aren’t present to respond.
Filix
FILIX: I don’t believe anyone is coming to save us, Thatch. Now we must save ourselves.
Plume
PLUME: I agree. We’re here because the Eye’s signal called to us and we followed. If we’re to find it, we need to not merely survive, but thrive.
PLUME: I believe we should migrate to the northern glacier.
Filix
FILIX: What if we use gravity crystals to craft a stable path?
Thatch
THATCH: Building beneath the crust again would shelter us from the volcanic moon’s eruptions.
THATCH: This is a wise point, Plume, and eloquently made. If moving to the northern glacier will keep us safer, then that is what we should do.
Filix
FILIX: Has anyone observed the phantom moon that sometimes greets us in the night sky? Your thoughts interest me.
Thatch
THATCH: I compliment your eyes! How do you imagine it disappears? Hypothesis: Could it be a shift in the light spectrum?
Plume
PLUME: Suppose this moon is too shy to show us its face.
PLUME: I’m interested in your playful moon. Is it much like its violent friend (Hollow’s Lantern)?
Thatch
THATCH: Imagine if there were two volcanic moons.
Plume
PLUME: Then I imagine there’d be none of us left!
Filix
FILIX: Hypothesis: There can exist too much lava.
Thatch
THATCH: I’d strongly prefer we test the null hypothesis.
Filix
FILIX: This moon isn’t volcanic (to my unaided eyes). Sometimes it leaves its friend Hollow’s Lantern for nights at a time.
Plume
PLUME: The nights the moon circles this planet appear random. It seems to travel as it likes.
Unknown Nomai
If the Eye called to us, why won’t it reveal itself? Why is it so difficult to locate it?
Did something happen to it?
Did the signal stop? Does the Eye no longer desire to be found?
Perhaps this isn’t the Eye’s choice. The Eye may not be able to communicate with us more than it already has.
Did the Eye deliberately call out to us by sending the signal, or did we hear the signal by coincidence?
We could be seeing meaning where there is none. Suppose the signal was produced incidentally.
Does that mean the Eye is any less important, though?
Perhaps the Eye wanted to be found (could it be sentient?). Maybe it chose us.
Does the Eye desire something from us? Could it need us in some way?
Maybe it doesn’t have to be us.
Is the Eye natural, or artificial?
Maybe someone built it.
The Eye is older than the universe itself. How could something exist before its creator?
It could be naturally occurring, though this doesn't answer how the Eye could be as old as it is.
Be welcomed in this place. This shrine is a space to reflect on what brought us to this star system: the signal from the Eye.
We observed the Eye’s signal in our travels, and followed it here to find its source.

Solanum
SOLANUM: I don’t know why everyone says the Eye is important.
SOLANUM: They say it brought us to this solar system, but is that good? Dad told me lots of Nomai died when our clan came here.

Melorae
MELORAE: This is amazing (look inside the cave)! How did this come to rest here? We haven’t encountered others in these caves; I think this is a rare find.
MELORAE: From what we can see, Coleus and I believe the specimen must be very old indeed. Imagine what we might learn if we could examine it!
Coleus
COLEUS: An update: We need to find a way inside quickly, Melorae, because when I returned here to search for an entrance to the cave, there were children playing on the specimen!
COLEUS: We both agree it’s unlikely this dry planet is this horror’s place of origin (especially considering what we observed during the Vessel’s evacuation).
Melorae
MELORAE: Clearly this hole is too small for it to have fit through. Hypothesis: There is another entrance to this cave. If there is, Coleus and I will find it! We can’t leave valuable information undiscovered!
MELORAE: We have found an enormous cavern at the end of this passage that appears promising! I believe we could construct long-term shelter there.
Annona
ANNONA: The cavern Melorae found is a wise choice for shelter. Could one of you mark directions for the others to follow?
Coleus
COLEUS: This is the start of the path to the shelter site. I've left directions to guide you there.

MELORAE: Of note: We must hurry, as the pathway there is filling with sand. Do not allow yourself to be buried by sand, and make sure no one is lost!
MELORAE: Anglerfish study
Coleus
COLEUS: An update: Melorae, while I was here making sketches of the anglerfish, I observed the children I saw earlier playing here again. They’ve added a rule to their game that incorporates our research (it’s wonderful)!
Melorae
MELORAE: I’m entirely delighted! It’s never too early to appreciate biology!
Coleus
COLEUS: This anglerfish’s digestive tract suggests death by starvation.
Melorae
MELORAE: Visually, the specimen appears to be of the same species as the anglerfish in Dark Bramble. We don’t believe it originated from this planet.
MELORAE: The long growth protruding from its head is bioluminescent. Perhaps it used this growth to attract prey (a lure?).
Laevi
LAEVI: Whoever was it when we ended last time is the anglerfish.
LAEVI: Rule change! The anglerfish now has to wear a blindfold. (And do not peek!)
LAEVI: The rest of us (the littlefish) line up against one wall. When the anglerfish says go, the littlefish sneak across to the other side.
LAEVI: If the anglerfish catches you, you’re eaten.
LAEVI: Last littlefish to be caught is the new anglerfish! (The old anglerfish gives the new anglerfish the blindfold and becomes a littlefish.)
Lami
LAMI: Why are we changing it? It’s too hard if you can’t see anything!
Laevi
LAEVI: Aunt Pye says real anglerfish are blind, so you have to wear a blindfold! The rule stands!
Ilex
ILEX: Rule update: It’s okay if younger kids don’t wear the blindfold when they’re it. (The rest of us will still wear it for scientific accuracy and to make the game more even.)
Melorae
MELORAE: This planet sometimes (and only sometimes) has a moon! This is also of note: It disappears if no one is watching it! Isn’t that a fascinating orbital characteristic?
Bur
BUR: I found your note, Melorae; kindly count me among this moon’s admirers! What is happening when it disappears (I doubt it ceases to exist)? Does it move to another location?
Annona
ANNONA: I believe so. Not only does the moon appear around Brittle Hollow, I can confirm it sometimes orbits Timber Hearth, as well.
Melorae
MELORAE: This is my first time encountering a natural satellite with the ability to vanish when not being watched. We should study it! Or, even better, we should travel there!
Bur
BUR: I agree! Our first step would be determining a method to track this phantom moon so that we can always know where it is.
Annona
ANNONA: Given its reluctance to move while consciously observed, it might be a form of macroscopic quantum mechanics.
Coleus
COLEUS: How curious! This rock took me with it to a new location. I wonder why this happened?
COLEUS: Curious, but also alarming: This new cave appears to lack an entrance or exit. Also, the rock that brought me here disappeared while I wasn’t watching.
COLEUS: The wandering rock has returned! Never before have I been so delighted to see a sedimentary specimen.
COLEUS: I wonder if I myself became quantum briefly when the rock carried me here! This seems the clearest explanation. Hypothesis: If the rock can bring me here, it can also carry me out.
COLEUS: My hypothesis was correct! I can travel on this rock, as long as I’m not observing my surroundings (meaning I must be in complete darkness). I’m going to bring my mentor here to see this.
COLEUS: Melorae is here now, too. We theorize when a conscious being is in contact with a quantum object and ceases to act as an observer (explaining the need for darkness), the being can become entangled with that quantum object, and they move together.
Melorae
MELORAE: Friends, Coleus has discovered a new quantum rule! (He has also promised me he’ll never vanish again, even if he does learn something useful from it!)
Melorae: Coleus is missing! He vanished from the Lakebed Cave (the one at the bottom of the dry lakebed at the north pole) several days ago, and we’re unable to find any trace of him. I don’t know how much air he had when he disappeared. I beg any friend reading this, help us recover Coleus!
MELORAE: Friends, if you find any sign of Coleus, I implore you to tell me! He vanished without a trace during our research trip, and has been missing ever since.
Bur
BUR: Melorae, some of us from the Sunless City are here to help search for Coleus. Can you tell us more about your expedition?
Melorae
MELORAE: You have my gratitude, Bur! Coleus and I were studying the caves’ geology. We hoped to learn more about a unique and wandering rock that visits several different caves in the area.
Annona
ANNONA: Where was young Coleus lost, Melorae?
Melorae
MELORAE: He disappeared in the cave at the bottom of the dry lakebed at the north pole. It happened in an instant, and without warning.
MELORAE: I turned away from Coleus to examine a sample, and when I turned back, he simply wasn’t there anymore. He had a limited supply of air, Annona! I’m afraid for him!
Annona
ANNONA: Hypothesis: We will learn more by examining the northern Lakebed Cave where Coleus disappeared. Search quickly, everyone; we have no time to squander!

Secca
SECCA: To any who come here searching for us: We followed one of the two beacons from the Vessel to this place, but now can go no further.
SECCA: It's almost too faint to hear now, but the Vessel’s beacon is still faintly emitting from within this thorny seed. Yet the opening is too small for even a single Nomai to fit through it, so our escape pod couldn’t have flown through here.
SECCA: I don’t understand how this could be possible, but this gruesome place seems able to manipulate space itself; maybe this was our undoing.
SECCA: To be so close to the location of the Vessel and still so far is... difficult. Worse, the Vessel’s beacon is dying; soon, we will be unable to hear it.
SECCA: There is nothing we can do now but try to perhaps find a way inside, or at least attempt to comprehend why this happened.
SECCA: My dearest hope is that the other escape pods were able to reach relative safety.
Din
DIN: There is a new problem: Our equipment is detecting two distinct beacons from the Vessel.
Secca
SECCA: But it isn’t possible for the Vessel to be in two different locations at the same time.
Din
DIN: I agree, but the beacons are exactly identical to each other. Perhaps if I had more time —
Secca
SECCA: We’re nearly out of time already, Din; the Vessel’s beacon is quickly fading. Soon, it will be gone, and we will be lost.
Escall
ESCALL: We will follow the beacon whose source is nearest to us.
Din
DIN: But suppose that beacon is false!
Escall
ESCALL: We likely don’t have enough air to reach the farther of the two beacons, Din. The decision is made for us.
ESCALL: We’ll leave a trail of lights as we go. There’s still a chance someone could hear our escape pod’s distress signal.

Phlox
PHLOX: I’m curious: Is sending a being’s memories back in time the same as sending the being itself back in time?
PHLOX: As an example, if we were to send my memories back in time, is that the same as sending “me” back in time (not my physical body, but my essence)?
Daz
DAZ: I imagine they’re two different actions.
Cassava
CASSAVA: Wouldn’t both actions be effectively the same?
Daz
DAZ: Suppose that time was being rewritten. I believe this is different than receiving memories from what is effectively the future.
Cassava
CASSAVA: But isn’t the end result identical in either case?
Phlox
PHLOX: Welcome to Giant’s Deep, friends! I’m excited for you to meet the statues!
PHLOX: If I’m not in my dwelling, I’m likely in my workshop below (inside the island).

Bells
BELLS: That’s exciting! You’re almost ready, but there’s still one more rule you need to learn. Come see me at the Tower of Quantum Knowledge.
BELLS: The tower is on the opposite side of Brittle Hollow. If you follow the path west to the Crossroads, you can reach the tower from there.
Solanum
SOLANUM: My gratitude for the directions, Bells. I’ll see you soon!
Cassava
CASSAVA: I have bad news, Avens. Yarrow says there was a problem with the proposed power source, so the Orbital Probe Cannon won’t be asked to fire.
Avens
AVENS: I hope you’re pulling my locomotive limb here, Cassava.
Cassava
CASSAVA: I wish I were, my friend, but no. They aren’t certain they can fix the problem, so the Orbital Probe Cannon is on indefinite hiatus.
CASSAVA: Tell Privet and Mallow they should return from the cannon. My spouse and I will remain at the Construction Yard, for now.
Avens
AVENS: An update: Mallow and I will join you and Daz. Privet left to visit her brother. She fears Idaea may feel responsible.
Mallow
MALLOW: Imagine, Privet: the Probe Tracking Module will be the first to know the coordinates of the Eye of the universe! You’ll be the first to see them!
Privet
PRIVET: I am honored and terrified!
PRIVET: You won’t ask the Orbital Probe Cannon to use so much power that it breaks, will you?
Mallow
MALLOW: Fret not, my nervous friend! We only need to fire the probe once, anyway, so who minds if it compromises the Orbital Probe Cannon’s structural integrity slightly?
Privet
PRIVET: I would mind, Mallow! I would mind, because we won’t be capable of receiving our probe’s data if the Probe Tracking Module is destroyed!
Avens
AVENS: Mallow, my better 50 percent! Cassava is sending the last of the cannon components. Soon (relatively speaking), we’ll know the Eye’s precise location!
Mallow
MALLOW: The thought of concluding our elders’ curious and challenging search increases my heart’s temperature, my love!
Avens
AVENS: Cassava tells me he and the Construction Yard crew have determined a power setting we are not, under any circumstances, to go above.
Mallow
MALLOW: I see! And am I right to think that, consequently, we’ll be ignoring that setting?
Avens
AVENS: I can posit with nearly 100 percent certainty our friends have accounted for our natures, so I suggest we do!
AVENS: Giving the Orbital Probe Cannon all the power it can structurally withstand creates the greatest chance of finding the Eye of the universe.
Mallow
MALLOW: Yes, the probe must travel as fast as it can, as far as it can. I’ll make some adjustments!
Yarrow
YARROW: I have exciting news, Privet: The Ash Twin Project is almost prepared to receive the probe data from the Orbital Probe Cannon.
YARROW: Ramie is adding some finishing touches here, but she’ll be finished soon. Are you and the Orbital Probe Cannon well?
Privet
PRIVET: We are! The statue here in the Probe Tracking Module is ready to record each launch’s flight trajectory and will automatically transmit all relevant data to you.
PRIVET: Once the probe determines the location of the Eye of the universe, I’ll send an alert directly to you and Ramie.
PRIVET: On the other appendage, I’m now worried about this cannon’s structural integrity and its crew’s moral integrity.
Yarrow
YARROW: What happened? Did the Sun Station not fire?
Pye
PYE: It fired, Yarrow. But it failed. The sun barely responded; there were infintestimally small surface-level changes, but they were barely visible, even to the third eye.
PYE: The Sun Station is useless. It will never, and could never, cause the sun to explode.
PYE: I don’t know what comes next, my friends. I suppose we must start over, but I’m unsure how to start over.
Yarrow
YARROW: Return to Ash Twin first, my friend. Perhaps a change of task would help: Spire noticed a comet approaching this star system that we’d like to investigate.
YARROW: Pye... I hurt for you, my friends; we all know how hard you’ve both worked. I can only offer my compassion. How are you? How is Idaea?
Idaea
IDAEA: We’re well, Yarrow (or as well as can be expected, given the circumstances), though disappointed. I may have disagreed with exploding the sun, but I never wished the device would fail. I’d hoped our terrible work was finished.

Yarrow
YARROW: Phlox and Daz finished the memory statues today, and they are truly remarkable.
YARROW: When the Ash Twin Project succeeds (or in the event it fails), the memory statues will activate, allowing us to gather more data before we shut down the project.
Clary
CLARY: Here’s our first delivery, Yarrow: one warp core, fresh from the Black Hole Forge! Root is installing this core’s sibling on Brittle Hollow as I write this.
CLARY: I wish I could wait here for you to arrive, but the forge (and my unfinished work there) is calling. I’ll return with more materials soon.
Yarrow
YARROW: My gratitude, Clary! With this, the Ash Twin Project is underway!
YARROW: I confess, I’m deeply curious about what you and Poke found on the White Hole Station that started this project. Could I visit sometime to learn more?
Clary
CLARY: I recommend you do! The White Hole Station is the model for the towers being built for the Ash Twin Project, so a visit to the station would be doubly useful.
Yarrow
YARROW: I suppose, more precisely, I would like to visit the White Hole Station with you, Clary.
Clary
CLARY: I’d be happy to explain our findings!
Poke
POKE: Yarrow, stop using this scroll wall to flirt with my sister (in romantic matters, her density rivals a neutron star’s) and go meet her on the White Hole Station.
Clary
CLARY: To our friends on Brittle Hollow: I just warped here from the White Hole Station (on the other side of Brittle Hollow’s black hole)! Our design worked; we’ve successfully recreated warp travel!
Filix
FILIX: This is wonderful news! I can’t wait to see the warp tower (although it’s been a long time since I’ve jumped through a black hole!).
Poke
POKE: I don’t know how close it is to Annona’s original design, but as long as what we’ve built works, then I’m delighted! I knew we could do it (Cassava, I hope you’re reading this)!
POKE: Wait, this can’t be correct. Clary, have you seen these readings? If they were accurate, they would violate causality. There must be an equipment error somewhere.
POKE: I’m returning to the White Hole Station. If you and Root meet me there, we can run a full diagnostic and hopefully locate the problem.
POKE: (Don’t tell Cassava.)
Pye
PYE: Ramie and I reviewed the records you sent, Poke, and they appear to show Nomai are arriving at the warp receiver on Brittle Hollow slightly before departing from the White Hole Station.
Poke
POKE: I understand it’s exceedingly odd, but Clary and I have tested and retested the equipment, and the result is the same every time someone warps.
Ramie
RAMIE: The interval is incredibly miniscule (roughly one hundred-thousandth of a second). Do you suppose our instruments can’t accurately measure time to such a small degree?
Pye
PYE: As I’ve already told Ramie, these measurements can’t be accurate. How can a Nomai arrive on Brittle Hollow before he or she ever stepped into the teleporter? The implications are absurd.
Poke
POKE: I don’t disagree. It would mean I’ve inadvertently broken several fundamental theories regarding this universe. We would have to reconsider all of our beliefs about the nature of time.
Ramie
RAMIE: Yes, I hope so, too!
RAMIE: Poke, as Pye is confident the reading is inaccurate, she’s kindly helping me attempt to recreate this phenomenon at the High Energy Lab. We’re designing an experiment to take more data.
Pye
PYE: An update: Poke, the High Energy Lab is in the canyon on Ember Twin’s equator. Come here at once. You need to see this.
Notes
Chert’s Research Notes — property of Chert!
This is an old crater. The neat thing here is that the composition of the samples I took from the impact site matches the composition of the ice on the outskirts of Dark Bramble.
I’d posit the Attlerock was hit with a piece of the planet that used to be where Dark Bramble now lies.
To follow up on — maybe there are more fragments of the old planet Dark Bramble destroyed on other astral bodies in the solar system?
Chert’s Research Notes - property of Chert!
Clearly, the Nomai were making astronomical observations here. They chose an excellent spot!
What is this big, rotating device for? What was it the Nomai were observing?
I’d posit there’s something special about the orange symbol on that device. Hal and the new astronaut’s translator tool would be nice to have handy about now.
I’ve detected a strange signal coming from somewhere within the grove in this crater.
It’s very similar to the signal emitted by the Quantum Moon, so it stands to reason the two signals are probably related.
We don’t know much about the Quantum Moon, seeing as no one’s ever been able to land on it, but hopefully studying the signal in the grove will reveal more about it.
Log
Esker’s Signalscope Log
Day 48: Still not picking up Riebeck’s banjo from Brittle Hollow. I’m sure they’re fine, but I’ll feel better once I can hear their music.
Day 51: Listened to Chert play for a while today. Unrelated, someone should tell Porphy and Gossan their flirting is not subtle from an aerial perspective.
Day 55: Banjo music coming in loud and clear today! Sounds like Riebeck’s doing okay. That oaf, I was worried!
Day 63: Today I thought I heard something... strange. I don’t know — it was probably nothing.
Day 70: No, it’s back again today, too. Something strange is coming from Timber Hearth.
Day 76: Okay, I know this is crazy, but the sound from Timber Hearth sounds exactly like Feldspar’s harmonica. But Feldspar disappeared in space ages ago. It can’t be them...
Day 88: It’s still here. This is creepy. Maybe my signalscope is broken? I’d better talk to Gneiss.
Note
FELDSPAR’S SPARE JETPACK FUEL
It’s annoying to schlep across the planet to the ship if I can’t use my jetpack, so I’m leaving this here.
I checked with my Little Scout — I do too use it, Hornfels, ya burnt marshmallow — and the scout’s integrity reading said this piece of Brittle Hollow is as stable as any, but who knows.
If the fuel’s still around, feel free to use it. If not, well, wherever you’re reading this note, I’m sure you’ve got bigger problems.

Ha ha, yeah! Yeah! All the way down to the core! Consider yourself conquered, Giant’s Deep — you just got Feldsparred.
That was one of my more dramatic feats, if I do say so myself. Can’t believe I wasn’t electrocuted! Ahhh, can’t wait to tell Hornfels and Gossan about this one — I guess brute force isn’t always the answer.
Right, so that’s one more off the list. Seems all that’s left is the big one now. Dark Bramble, here I come!

Gneiss
Hello there, space cadet! I hear you’re leaving the crater today.
If you meet any of the other travelers up there, remind them to take proper care of their instruments, won’t you?
Me
Tell me about the travelers’ instruments.
Where’s the observatory?
Just saying hi before I leave.
Gneiss
Take care of yourself up in space!
It’s questions like that what make us worried about you going up into space on your own, you know.
The observatory is up the path behind the waterfall. There are a couple of signs marking the way, but really, you just keep going up and then hook a right when you get to the zero-g cave.
Oh, sure! I made all of their instruments, you know. Let me see... There’s Chert’s drums, Riebeck’s banjo, and Gabbro’s flute.
And Feldspar’s harmonica, of course, though Feldspar’s been missing for a long time. Sometimes it feels like just yesterday they were playing their harmonica around the campfire...
Anyway, you hear music in space, that’ll be one of the space program’s other travelers. If you feel like company, you can always pull out your signalscope and track them down.
Trouble is, every time a Hearthian leaves for outer space, that’s one less musician in our orchestra.
So! Did you need something?
Me
Tell me about the travelers’ instruments.
Where’s the observatory?
Nah, I’m good.
Gneiss
Everything okay? Seems kind of early for you to be back from space.
Did you need something from me?
Me
Tell me about the travelers’ instruments.
I’m good, actually.
Gneiss
Alright. Take care, now.

Gossan
Hey, I thought I might see you before the big launch.
Nerves getting the better of you?
Me
Right, like you weren’t nervous for your first flight.
I’m a little nervous, yeah.
Are you kidding? I’m a natural at this!
Gossan
Hey, don’t worry about it. Your nerves are between you, me, and the vast endlessness of space.
But really, you’ll do fine out there. I’d worry more about that ship, if I were you. Hopefully that lunatic Slate at least fixed the retro rockets.
Good. Everyone should be a bit nervous going into space. I got cocky during my first flight and nearly put a new crater in the moon.
Still, I was never as green as you.
Me
Hey, I’ve gotten better!
That’s not what Slate says...
Gossan
Is that so? Funny, I seem to recall the first time you strapped on a jetpack, we had to come fish you out of the crater near the south pole.
Oi, you know better than to believe a word that lunatic says about me.
They’re still sore I made them install a safety harness in the cockpit. Claimed it would "throw off the thrust-to-weight ratio."
Honestly. One of these days I’m gonna throw off Slate’s thrust-to-weight ratio.
Think so, do you? Feel like proving it to your old flight coach?
There’s a "satellite" — which is definitely not just a piece of broken mining equipment — set up down in the zero-g cave and in need of repairs.
If you’re looking for a little last-minute zero-g practice, head down the lift and into the cave. Or don’t, so long as you’re confident you can make ship repairs in space.
Me
One repaired "satellite," coming up!
Nah, I’m ready for the real deal.
Gossan
So listen, there’s a "satellite" — which is definitely not just a piece of broken mining equipment — set up down in the zero-g cave and in need of repairs.
If you’re looking for a little last-minute zero-g practice, head down the lift and into the cave. Or don’t, so long as you’re confident you can make ship repairs in space.
Me
One repaired "satellite," coming up!
Nah, I’m ready for the real deal.
Gossan
Cool. Get to it, and try not to concuss yourself right before your first launch.
Heh. Darn right you are.
Don’t get yourself killed out there, you hear? Not after I’ve put this much work into training you.
...Haha, go on, go make Outer Wilds Ventures proud.
If you changed your mind about practicing ship repairs, head down the lift and into the zero-g cave.
You just need to maneuver over to the "satellite" and repair each damaged area, same as you’ll be doing for your ship.
What’s the holdup? That "satellite" isn’t going to repair itself.
You just need to maneuver over to the "satellite" and repair each damaged area, same as you’ll be doing for your ship.
Nicely done! Of course, it’ll be a little more stressful when you’re hurtling through space, but just remember your training and try not to hit anything big.
I can see you’re itching to get off this rock, so go get the launch codes from the observatory and get out of here already.
Best of luck out there! And hey, try to avoid getting yourself killed now that I’ve put so much time into training you, got it?
You’re back awfully soon. Everything alright? Slate didn’t do anything dumb like install a self-destruct button, did they?
Oi, don’t forget to put on a suit! I don’t want to have to come fish you out of there again.
Note
Hey! Come say hi to your old flight coach before your launch. I’ve got zero-g training set up if you want a refresher.

Hal
Hey, hey! So did you get a good look at that Nomai statue?
Me
The statue looked at me and opened its eyes!
The statue was glowing! Why was it glowing?!
Hal
Whoa, whoa — the statue was doing what?
So its eyes opened, and then you saw images from your own memories and glowing lights flying around? You mean like a hallucination?
Listen, no offense, but... are you sure you’re okay to launch? Like, medically speaking?
Me
You know what, don’t worry about it.
No, that statue is definitely weird.
Hal
Maybe you should sit down for a bit and take it easy. I’d hate for anything bad to happen if you tried to launch while you’re not feeling great.
But hey, when you are ready, then you can make the most of our translator tool! Sniff... I can’t believe it’s all grown up and leaving for space already.
For real, though, I’m glad you’re the one carrying it and not, like, Riebeck. They’d fall on it for sure.
Say, if you want to do a short trip to just get your space legs under you, you could check out the ruins on the Attlerock! I’d love to learn what those are.
I mean, if you’re saying it happened, then... I guess maybe it did. But why?
Hornfels tried everything to get the statue’s eyes to open, and nothing like this ever happened to them.
I don’t think you’re going to get any answers from the museum statue, but Gabbro said they were going back to Giant’s Deep. Dunno which island they’re on, though.
Maybe they’d be able to tell you more? On the other hand, Gabbro’s, y’know, Gabbro, so maybe you’d be better off searching for more info on your own.
...Geez, now I’m really jealous you’re going into space! Hey, see if you can use our translator tool to find out more about the statue, okay?
Good luck, and safe flying!
Hey again!
Was there something else?
Me
Where on Giant’s Deep would I find Gabbro?
Where’s the Nomai statue in the museum from?
Why did the Nomai make that statue?
Wonder if I’ll discover anything cool in space.
See you later.
Hal
Gabbro said they were going back to Giant’s Deep to wherever they found that Nomai statue. One of the islands, I think.
You remember Gabbro plays a flute, right? Like, all the time? I bet your signalscope could find them easily.
If you do see Gabbro, say hi for me!
From Giant’s Deep! Gabbro fished it out of the oceans and brought it back here for study.
Hornfels doesn’t know much about it yet, just that it’s crazy old and super tough. I wonder why the Nomai carved it?
Apparently, Gabbro went back to Giant’s Deep to try to learn more about the statue. Maybe they’ll find some answers there.
Good question! You know how Gabbro knocked a fragment off the statue while they were hauling it back from Giant's Deep?
Hornfels analyzed the fragment and figured out the stone it's made from can store information — I heard Slate ended up repurposing it for your ship’s computer.
I’m not sure what the statue opening its eyes has to do with anything, but maybe the statue was made for storing information, too?
Hey, you never know — maybe you’ll be the one to uncover the Nomai’s mysteries!
Or maybe you’ll discover a new kind of rock or something.
But honestly, as long as they don’t end up naming new safety equipment after you, I’m sure you’ll have done a great job.
Be careful out there in space!

Marl
So it’s launch day, huh? Hal’s going to miss you.
Speaking of launch day... I was thinking about it, and the platform those ships launch from is getting old. Isn’t it about time you built a new, less flammable one?
That big tree in the village would be the perfect choice. I wouldn’t mind helping out the space program. Just say the word!
Me
The current launch pad is fine, thanks.
Nice try. We all know you have it out for that tree.
The launch pad is FLAMMABLE?!
Marl
Oh. Really? Dang.
Well, maybe someone needs a new porch or something. A big one.
What? No, I just think it’s in the way and someone ought to chop it down, you know? Specifically, me.
...Haha, you think this has to do with the time I fell out of it and broke my arm? That was when we were hatchlings! Who would hold a grudge for that long?
Ha! You didn’t realize that?
Don’t worry, it’s held up for all the launches so far. It’ll definitely be fine for yours. Probably.
If you swing by the moon, say hi to Esker for me.
...That tree has got it coming.
What are you doing back? Did you forget your spacesuit or something?

Porphy
Porphy
Heyo, hatchling!
I hear you’re leaving us to seek adventure amongst the stars. When you return, let’s you, me, and Gossan open up a bottle of the Good Stuff.
Me
I’m only seeking adventure amongst one star, actually. Other stars are too far away.
The Good Stuff is less "delicious sap wine" and more "daunting digestive challenge."
Porphy
Another metaphor ruined in the name of scientific accuracy.
Nevertheless, I do hope you enjoy your travels. Good luck!
An iron stomach is the mark of a true Hearthian, my friend.
Our hardy hunter-gatherer lifestyle stems from trial and error. By which I mean our ancestors survived eating a lot of bad things.
Ho, the astronaut returns!
Tell me, what I can do for you?
Me
Any new dirt?
What are you up to?
I’m good, actually.
Porphy
I’m hoping to teach Esker to tap trees next time they return from the Attlerock. If they’ll bring me lunar sap, I can attempt moon wine!
I’ve just finished sealing up another batch of sap wine for aging. I like to begin aging a batch on the day of a significant occasion, you know!
That’s why there are so many bottles labeled "structural collapse" and "house fire."
Enjoy your travels!
Oh my, and here I thought I’d heard your ship take off. Was your adventure only a short one?
Recording
Okay, wow. Wow. I’ve seen this ruin in other travelers’ pictures, but seeing it for myself...
It’s really old, isn’t it?
But wow, this is the coolest day of my life. ...Okay, um, time for some official notes!
So this is some kind of Nomai "locator." It can point out the different planets - which is incredibly cool, by the way - but from what little I can understand of the writing here, I think it was built to try to find something specific?
I’m not sure. I also was able to translate something about the south pole of Brittle Hollow, so I’ll fly there to see if I can learn more.
Yep. Just gonna get back in the ol’ ship and take off. Totally safe... Mostly safe. Oh, stars above...
Journal
The journey here from the south pole has been, um... I’m going to go with "harrowing," because of the, um, all of the meteors. But hey, at least I made it here unconcussed and not on fire!
Okay, let’s see... I poked around a little, and there’s some sort of old Nomai path that starts across from my campsite, inside the ruined building with trees growing out of it.
Doesn’t look like anything horrible - just stairs leading down. I can handle stairs! After I get my supplies together, I’ll follow the path and see where it leads.
Hurgh. Well. That was... deeply unpleasant. I made it this far, though. Guess that’s the part to focus on, and not how I’ll eventually have to get back up that path.
But wow, this place sure is something! Looks like the Hanging City is north from here. And east is a gravity cannon! I definitely want to see that.
And another thing - I’m detecting oxygen from somewhere below. Which is good, since I, uh, used up a lot of my supply screaming during the trip down from the surface.
As soon as I stop dry heaving, I’m going to head farther down below so I can refill my tank.
At first I thought this was an old Nomai settlement, but on closer inspection, I don’t think anyone ever lived here. These buildings are atypical for Nomai dwellings.
My best guess? This could be where the Nomai made gravity crystals. We know they mined raw from material from below the crust on Brittle Hollow, then refined that material to produce the crystals.
Gravity crystals produce a local gravity distortion that affects the area around them, up to a certain radius. They’re very clever! Nomai used them to anchor themselves to surfaces they might want to traverse down.
We Hearthians have borrowed their technology in our ships, where gravity crystals keep astronauts anchored to just one flat plane (thank the stars!).
Recording
I’m here! I did it! I put the ship down safely!
Um, in that the ship went down, and I didn’t sustain bodily harm. A few minor repairs, and it’s like the ship never even hit those rocks!
One of my better attempts. Feldspar would barely have laughed at me, I bet.
That’s the good news. The bad news... I, uh, haven’t found a way inside this structure yet. The door is broken, and I know I’m not great at exploring, but I think I would have found a different entrance by now if there were one. P... probably.
I can’t get inside from here, but I know there are paths below the surface. I’m going to head north to the ruins on the equator to try to find a way down.

You’re actually blasting off in that thing, huh?

They really don’t explode as often anymore.
I’m told my odds of survival are statistically quite high.
Rutile
All I know is between the space program and Mica’s model rockets, things seem to burn to the ground around here more than they used to.
Yeah, the space program’s certainly come a long way. I should probably thank you for causing fewer flash fires than your predecessors.
By the way, good luck with those retro rockets.
Hey, what can I do for you?
Me
Marl is plotting to cut down that big tree. Again.
Are you going to watch the launch?
Do you really worry that the space program will burn the village down?
I’m good.
Rutile
Sigh... I suppose it’s my duty as mayor to stop them. Again.
When Marl fell out of that tree and broke their arm, I suspect they might have also hit their head on the way down.
Only constantly. You learn to live with it.
You also learn to sleep with a bucket of water next to your bed, just in case.
Of course!
I’ll be watching from a safe distance, obviously, and mostly to make sure nothing catches fire. But watching nonetheless.
Glad to hear it.
You’re back already? Is everything OK?

Fishing rhyme, fishing rhyme... Singing helps me pass the time.
You’re leaving the crater? Guess we’ll all be a little busier without you around to lend a hand.
That big water planet, Giant’s Deep - that’s where I’d go.
Me
Why’s that?
I need to find Hornfels.
Spinel
Did you try the observatory? I’ve literally never seen them anywhere else.
One time, after the rest of the village had left to sleep and it was just the two of us sitting around the campfire, Gabbro told me about their first trip to Giant’s Deep.
They landed their ship easily enough in the waves, but couldn’t see too far down, on account of how murky the water was, I guess. Too dark.
Gabbro wants to see what lay beneath the surface, so they decided to travel deeper. They traveled down, and down...
But suddenly, Gabbro couldn’t go any further.
Me
Tell me more.
Yeah, Giant’s Deep has a current you can’t pass through.
I underestimated how boring this would be. Goodbye.
Spinel
...You always were my least favorite astronaut.
I will, I was just pausing dramatically.
Sure, okay, but shut up a minute. This is the good part.
As though exercising a will of its own, the water was refusing to let Gabbro go any deeper. It held Gabbro back. ...Almost as if it were trying to protect them from something.
And then, in the terrible darkness, Gabbro saw it...!
The tentacle of some hideous beast!
Me
AHHH!
Is that all true?
...Was there sap wine involved during Gabbro’s campfire story?
Spinel
I mean, that’s what Gabbro said, anyway. Whatever it was, it freaked Gabbro out pretty good.
Everyone wants to hear new stories at the village campfire, you know. Make sure you bring some back with you!
Heard it from Gabbro themself! Gabbro can be a little fanciful, sure, but they aren’t a liar. I mean, probably, anyway.
I guess if you want to know if the story’s entirely true, you can go see Giant’s Deep for yourself!
Come to think of it, don’t you have somewhere you should be exploring that isn’t here?
Fishing song, fishing song... Geez, I think my bait is wrong.
What are you up to?
Me
I’m looking for Hornfels.
Nothing.
Spinel
Oh, them? I’d bet today’s haul they’re in the observatory.
Not that I’ve caught anything yet, but if I had, I’d definitely bet it. Hornfels is pretty much always in the observatory.
That’s nice. I’m planning to do a lot of that later.
You can go away now, assuming you’re done scaring off all the fish.
Listen, go to space or stay here, but pick one or the other! You’re scaring off all the fish.
Fishing tune, fishing tune... uh... yeah, I didn’t think this one through at all.

Tektite
Heyo, hatchling! Thought you were taking that tin can of yours into space today - what’re you still doing here?
Me? I saw something crash over the horizon and didn’t like what I was seeing in the pictures my Little Scout was sending back, so I thought I’d come over here myself and take a look.
Me
So what crashed?
Is that a Dark Bramble seed?
Tektite
You again, eh, hatchling? Thought I heard you lift off earlier. What’re you still doing on Timber Hearth?
Me? I’m out here to see what it was I saw crash over this way. That, and make sure nothing’s on fire.
Me
So what crashed?
Is that a Dark Bramble seed?
Tektite
You again, eh, hatchling? Thought I heard you lift off earlier. What’re you still doing on Timber Hearth?
Me? That Scout photo you took earlier showed smoke, so I came over to check for fires, remember?
Me
So what crashed?
Is that a Dark Bramble seed?
Tektite
I dunno what it is, exactly. Looks like some kind of plant seed, but it’s not anything I’ve seen on Timber Hearth before - and trust me, I was quite the explorer back in the day.
D’you think it’s extraterrestrial? It kinda looks like something that might’ve come off of Dark Bramble. Whatever it is, it put down roots in a hurry.
You think so? It’s nothing I’ve ever seen on Timber Hearth before, so you’re probably onto something there.
Whatever it is, it put down roots in a hurry.
I don’t like the look of this thing, hatchling, and that’s a fact. Think I’ll set Marl and Hal loose on it. Best get rid of this mess sooner rather than later, and no one can remove an unwanted plant faster than a tree keeper can.
I’ll have to get a look at what’s inside the seed, first, though. Don’t want to set anybody to hacking up a potentially dangerous plant without a better idea of what’s lurking inside there.
Tuff can help me haul the old scout launcher over here. Obviously the opening is too small for someone to fit inside, and anyway, I’m not gonna blindly stick my hands into anything that looks as unpleasant as that seed does.
That’s a good way to lose an arm or two.
Blasted seed did a lot of damage when it crashed. I liked this crater.
Need something from me, hatchling?
Me
I threw a Little Scout into the seed.
My signalscope is picking up a harmonica inside the seed.
You’re sure this seed isn’t from Timber Hearth?
Nope, I’m good.
Tektite
You did, did you? And you’re telling me it’s bigger on the inside than on the outside?
Hmph. This is going to be a chore to chop up, and no mistake. Can we even remove a seed that doesn’t have the decency to stay the same size all the way through?
Maybe I’d better grab an extra axe or three, just in case.
Inside the seed? Huh. Dunno what to tell you there - the only harmonica player I know is Feldspar, and they disappeared ages ago.
Listen here, don’t go telling Gneiss about the harmonica music, okay? They’ll never let me get rid of this darn seed if they suspect it has any musical talent.
Back in my younger days, I explored everywhere there is to go on Timber Hearth and saw everything there is to see, and then some. Trust me, we don’t have anything like this.
Nah, I reckon this thing’s from Dark Bramble if it’s from anywhere, hatchling.
Alright then, see you around.

If it isn’t my favorite troublemaker.
What’s with the radio?
Tephra
We wanted to play hide and seek, but Moraine won’t let us borrow their signalscope because it’s “really delicate” and “not supposed to be thrown around like that.”
Hey, hey, can we use your Signalscope? Can we? Can we, please? We’ll even let you be "it"!
Me
Sure, let’s play!
Sorry, can’t today.
Tephra
Woohoo! Okay, here are the rules. Galena and me will hide with these radios, and you’ll use your Signalscope to find us.
Last one to be found wins! Okay, close your eyes and start counting!
Awww, really? But we can’t play without a Signalscope... Play with us later, okay?
Awww, you found me? But my hiding spot was super good!
Don’t forget, you have to find both of us, okay?
You got me, but I’m the last one. I win!
Promise you’ll play again when you get back from space, okay? You gotta!
I wanted to hide in the observatory, but Hornfels said I was "making a nuisance of myself."
Hullo, astronaut!
We’re all going to watch your launch later. I hope space is nice!
Hullo, astronaut! Are you going into space today?
Are you going into space and never coming back like Feldspar did?
Me
...What?
Don’t worry, I’ll come back.
That’s pretty disturbing.
Tephra
Yeah, um, Hornfels says Feldspar went away into space and didn’t come back. Hornfels says Feldspar was the best pilot ever, but no one knows what happened to them.
Me
Hornfels probably shouldn’t be telling you stuff like this.
That’s not something I want to think about right now.
Tephra
Hornfels says that, too.
But if Feldspar disappeared, you might disappear, too, right?
You’re not as good as Feldspar, so you should be really careful not to get lost.
That’s what Feldspar said, too, but they never did.
Hornfels will be really sad if you don’t come back, like how sad it makes them to talk about Feldspar. So you should make sure you don’t get lost in space, too.
But Hornfels says no one knows what happened to Feldspar. Hornfels says they got lost in space even though they were the best pilot ever.
You’re not as good as Feldspar, so you should be really careful not to get lost.
Hullo, astronaut!

So you’re going in there? In the cave? Hnnngh...
What? No, I’m fine. Great. Great and fine.

You don’t look fine...
Yeah, I’m going to drift around down there for a while.
Tuff
Well you know I hate that cave so I don’t know why you’re making me talk about it.
Fweh... Now I’ve got hand sweats.
Eurgh...

Just going to float upside down and whatnot.
...Sorry. I’ll stop.
Tuff
I’m going to sit here and think about flat, motionless rocks for a while.
H-hurk...

Just, y’know, ricochet off the walls. Spin around a lot. That kind of thing.
That was too far, wasn’t it.

Tuff
You’re... Urp... You’re the worst.

Tuff
Oh, no. Nooooo, no no no. No way.
You want to run off into space, that’s your business, but don’t make me, you know, think about it.
Bad enough we got this weird cave down here...
Some fresh dirt? Not much happening down here lately. Let me think...
Come to think of it, Tektite saw something crash outside of the village crater earlier. That’s new and different.
Me
Oh, hey. How ’bout that.
Is anything on fire?
Tuff
Yeah, they were on firewatch with the old scout launcher and saw smoke, so they went to check it out. "Safety first," right?
...No, I'm kidding. I said that to Tektite once. Pretty rude how long they laughed for, if you ask me.
Probably only a little. Tektite checked out the crash site with the old firewatch scout launcher and saw smoke, so they headed over to stamp out any leftover fires.
Well, I better get back to work. This ore’s not going to mine itself, you know.
Hurgh...
Oh, I thought I heard you lift off. Change your mind?

I needed a little more zero-g time.
Give me the dirt.

Hi, astronaut!
You know the patch of ghost matter inside this fence? Gossan said it used to be bigger when they were a hatchling. 'Cause ghost matter evaporates.
It just takes a su-u-u-per long time to go away.
I hope there's still ghost matter in the village when I'm a grown-up. Ghost matter is awesome!
Me
Ghost matter is super cool. It'll burn the heck out of you!
You shouldn't be throwing rocks in there — ghost matter is dangerous.
You know ghost matter is how Tektite lost their foot, right?
Arkose
Yeah! I heard touching it hurts so bad it feels like your whole hand's on fire!
Try not to walk into any in space, okay? That sounds bad and painful.
Uhhh, obviously? That's what makes it so awesome? Geez, I'm not dumb enough to touch it.
Ugh, you're such a grown-up.
Whoa, really?! ...That is so cool!
It's cool that Little Scouts can detect ghost matter and all, but what would be really cool is if the Little Scout could, like, shoot ghost matter at stuff. All pew pew pew!

This anglerfish specimen was found attached to the landing gear of one of our ships that flew close to Dark Bramble. It appears well-suited to living in dark places with minimal atmosphere.
Of all the lifeforms who will perish in the oncoming death of the universe, we will miss the anglerfish the least.
Outer Wilds Ventures, Timber Hearth’s first and only space program, was founded to explore the farthest reaches of our solar system.
Feldspar was the first Hearthian to be intentionally launched into space. They completed the first orbit around Timber Hearth and later made the first of what would be many landings on our moon, the Attlerock.
Outer Wilds Ventures was founded by Feldspar, Gossan, Slate, and Hornfels to explore a solar system at the end of the universe.

Aren’t you gonna go into space? Aren’t you? You better not have changed your mind!

Hey, I’m still going!
I want to practice with a pro before I leave.
I hear you and Slate beefed up the model ship. Can I see it?
Mica
You better be! It’s been forever since anyone launched into space. I really, really want to see it.
Really bad.
Hey, you want to try out my model ship? Slate says it’s just like the real thing, only less likely to start a fire.
Aww, you’re just saying that. ...But if you really want to practice with me, I guess I could help you out a little.
Yeah, we recalibrated the controls and installed better thrusters. Want to give it a test drive? Slate says it’s just like the real thing, only less likely to start a fire.
Try to land on one of the geyser pools. Show me what you’ve got!
Wow, that was just like the time the external fuel tanks exploded on reentry!
You’ll... you’ll be okay flying the big one, right?
What a landing! I guess that’s why Slate lets you fly the real thing, huh?
Someday, I want to design a ship that goes even faster than the ones Slate makes!
Slate says they think I can do it. And Gossan says I should ask Slate to be my first test pilot.
Exhibit
This remarkably intact statue was carved by the Nomai, an ancient species who dwelled in our solar system thousands of years ago.
The statue provides us with our most detailed look yet at the Nomai, who appear to have been covered with a layer of fur. Note the decorative jewelry that has been carved as part of the antlers.
Although their artifacts and structures have been found on almost every planet in this solar system, we still have no idea where this species came from or what happened to them.
This pilot seat, used by pioneering astronaut Feldspar, is all that remains of our inaugural flight into space.
Although it’s been argued such a distinction requires a breathtakingly liberal definition of flight, that day will nevertheless always be remembered as a landmark achievement in Hearthian history.
Aside from the dwellings and structures they built, the Nomai also made art. This decorated pottery was discovered on Brittle Hollow.
Some ancient Nomai art depicts strange animals, foreign celestial objects, and other subjects that can’t be found in our solar system, which makes us wonder whether the Nomai originated elsewhere in the universe or simply had vibrant imaginations.
Were the Nomai born in our solar system? Or were they born among other stars and planets - and if they were, how and why did they come here?
These are just some of the questions we hope to answer through further xenoarchaeological expeditions.
The Nomai technology brought back from space by our astronauts has been a great boon to Outer Wilds Ventures, allowing us to modify expedition gear in exciting and useful ways.
For example, the Little Scout now boasts a warp retrieval capability that allows astronauts to recall their scouts almost instantly. This has dramatically reduced the number of scouts lost to the depths of space.
The Nomai never got to see it for themselves, but thanks to their efforts and technology, a Hearthian was able to reach the Eye of the universe.
The strange rock moving around in this grotto appears to react to conscious observation.
The level-headed among us realize there must be some sort of optical illusion at play, but Gabbro claims the rock "exists in all possible states until it is observed" (whatever that means).
Whatever is actually happening, both sides of this debate agree the effect is extremely creepy.

Oh, you launched! That’s great. Great job, you.
Wow, I guess that means I’ve been out here a while, huh. Well, um, this is Brittle Hollow. But you probably knew that.
Lot of history here. ...It’s great.
Me
What are you doing here?
I’m in a hurry — can I ask you something?
Riebeck
I’m here to see the Hanging City. It’s always been my dream to see it with my own four eyes, ever since I was a hatchling.
An alien race lived in this solar system long before our species even existed! How could I not want to see what their civilization was like?
Only...
You’ve... probably heard the others say it, right? I’m afraid of space. Seriously, I’m more surprised than anybody that I’m out here.
Do you want to know how I even got this far? I fell. Tripped over a gravity crystal. It’s dumb luck I landed somewhere my Little Scout says is halfway stable, instead of being sucked into... what’s below.
I’ve been gauging the stability of the ground around me using my Little Scout, and this seems to be the place with the best surface integrity, so I’m just going to stay here until I’m ready to move on.
...But that’s enough about me and my problems. You didn’t come all this way to listen to me blather, did you! Heh, that’d be... yeah.
Hi! ...What’s up?
Um, sure — of course! Anything you want.
Me
I learned something!
Where should I explore here?
What are you doing out here?
See you later.
Riebeck
Me? I’m an archeologist, remember?
Or, um, the archeologist, I guess. Seeing as I’m all Timber Hearth’s got right now.
Brittle Hollow is rich with Nomai history. That’s why I’m here. This planet is an absolute treasure trove of culture, history, and science.
If you have any questions about the Brittle Hollow Nomai, I’m your Hearthian! Or, um... I have some knowledge of them, I mean. So. Maybe I can help?
Oh wow, where shouldn’t you explore here? Um, not the black hole, actually. That’s... very no.
Which is unfortunate, because uh, the most exciting stuff is all below the crust. Including the Hanging City — that’s just to the north. You can kinda see it from here.
There’s also this big dome on the south pole called the Southern Observatory. You can’t get inside from the surface — trust me, I tried — but if it’s like the rest of the Nomai structures here, there’s probably a path to it beneath the crust somewhere.
Good luck with exploring. Um, if you learn anything about the Nomai, I’d love to hear it, if it’s not too much trouble?
Oh, cool! Um, what is it?
Me
I found the Nomai escape pod on Brittle Hollow.
I found the Vessel!
I saw the old settlement.
I saw the Hanging City on Brittle Hollow.
I saw the Sunless City on Ember Twin.
I found Nomai writing about a quantum pilgrimage.
I went to the comet, and...
I TALKED TO A LIVING NOMAI!
Actually, nevermind.
Riebeck
Oh, okay. If you do find learn something new about the Nomai, though, I’d love to hear it! Um, if you don’t mind, I mean.
Wow! So then, the Nomai probably came here from somewhere outside the solar system. And they must have been in trouble when they launched their escape pod... but what kind of trouble?
And where did the escape pod launch from? I’m so curious!
This is an amazing discovery. I hope we can find out more about how and why the Nomai arrived here!
You did?! That, that’s incredible, congratulations!
That means they really were from far outside our solar system. Haha, yes! I knew it!
But that creates so many new questions! If they didn’t come from our solar system, where did they come from? Are they from our galaxy, or somewhere even farther? What were their lives like before they came here? And why did they come here?
Hey, I... I might not be much of an astronaut, but I’m really glad I came out here to see the Nomai’s artifacts for myself. And, um, thanks for telling me. About the Vessel, I mean.
Isn’t it amazing? Hard to believe the settlement is still standing, but there it is.
It really makes you appreciate living somewhere like Timber Hearth. You know, somewhere that isn’t being constantly bombarded with meteors and rocks and stuff.
You visited the Hanging City? Oh gosh, how was it? Was it amazing? Was it beautiful? ...Was it scary?
The Hanging City is where the Nomai settled permanently on Brittle Hollow. It was their most advanced settlement here!
Why they chose to build their most advanced settlement so close to a you-know-what is beyond me. Maybe that kind of thing makes sense to a Nomai, though. ...Maybe they needed the black hole for something?
You mean there’s another Nomai city inside of Ember Twin? That’s incredible! A whole city, and I had no idea it existed! This is great!
How did they keep the sand out? If it were me, I’d be nervous about getting buried in the caves by that awful river of sand. Gosh, the Nomai sure were ingenius, building an entire settlement underground. The Sunless City! ...Wow!
That means there were two groups of Nomai — one that lived on Ember Twin, and one that lived here on Brittle Hollow. But they must have traveled around the solar system, since Nomai writing can be found on other planets, too.
A pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon? The Nomai mentioned the Quantum Moon in a lot of their writing, so it was clearly special to them. And um, special enough to make a trip there by themselves!
It sounds like a coming-of-age ritual, like how hatchlings stay hatchlings until their stomachs are strong enough to drink sap wine.
Maybe once a Nomai journeyed to the Quantum Moon, they were considered an adult?
Oh, wow. Wow. So that’s how the Nomai died?
That’s... really sad, isn’t it? I know it was a long time ago, but still...
Stars above, it’s lucky we hadn’t evolved to live on land yet.
To think, if the comet hadn’t killed them, our species might have coexisted in this solar system. That would have been amazing.
But...
I guess if I hadn’t wanted to learn why the Nomai disappeared, I’d never have left Timber Hearth and come out here, or had any of these adventures.
...Don’t get me wrong, space is terrifying! But, you know, it has its moments.
AHHH! That doesn’t make any sense! I don’t understand! I am very excited for you, though! P-please stop yelling!
...What? On the Quantum Moon, you said? There’s a sort of-living Nomai on the Quantum Moon?!
WELL, WHY DIDN’T YOU SAY SO?!
Oh wow! Wow! This is the best thing that’s ever happened in the history of Outer Wilds Ventures! I can’t believe you talked to an actual Nomai!
Great! So I just have to go back into space, fly to the Quantum Moon with zero visibility, find a spooky ruin, and travel through a few different types of dangerous terrain to get there.
Okay, yeah, that’s... that’s not so bad. That’s probably doable...
Exhibit
This piece of Nomai writing was essential to deciphering their unique language.
Although this text is linear, Nomai text often branches off from a central point. Interestingly, each branch tends to be written by a different author.
What you see here are parts of the Nomai skeleton. We can tell from their skulls that they possessed antlers and, quite unusually, only three eyes.
The Nomai body was most likely adapted for living exclusively on land. The differences in the Nomai’s anatomy, such as their shockingly fragile bone structure, show us that Hearthians couldn’t have descended from Nomaian ancestors.
It’s not clear where the Nomai originated from, or why they disappeared. We hope to find more clues to this puzzle as we explore our solar system.
The Nomai who came to our solar system were following a signal from the Eye of the universe.
They perished when the Interloper arrived, bringing with it the deadly substance we called ghost matter that flooded the entire solar system almost instantly and without warning.
We never figured out how they died.
Stars like our sun generate light and heat by fusing hydrogen into helium.
As it grows older, the star runs out of hydrogen and starts to contract.
As the star’s core contracts, it gets hotter, causing the outer layers to expand. The star has become a red giant.
When the core is hot enough, it starts to fuse helium into carbon.
If a star is massive enough, it will continue to fuse carbon into even heavier elements like iron.
Ultimately, the star will collapse under its own gravity and then explode in a violent event called a supernova.
Based on Chert's observations, this will one day be the fate of our own sun.
At the end of its lifespan, our sun collapsed under its own gravity and then exploded in a violent supernova.
Watch closely... these balls move on their own!
The ground is perfectly level, so what do you think causes this spooky motion?
The answer is the moon! As it orbits our planet, the Attlerock’s gravity pulls on objects from different directions. In fact, it’s pulling on you right now!

POKE: No, that’s correct. For these alignments we've decided to treat the Hourglass Twins as a single astral body.
POKE: Have you seen Phlox’s tower designs in the High Energy Lab on Ember Twin? They clarify each tower’s warp destination.
POKE: If it helps, you can imagine the Hourglass Twins as aligning with themselves.
Thatch
THATCH: This knowledge is too dear to lose: Here is everything we can recall about the signal we encountered while aboard the Vessel.
Filix
FILIX: The signal looked like an eye: round, with a circle at the center much like a pupil. (Suppose the signal was looking for something.)
FILIX: The signal was older than the universe itself! This is the most significant detail.
Plume
PLUME: No Nomai clan has ever encountered anything like it! How can anything in this universe be older than the universe itself?
Thatch
THATCH: Imagine what rare and profound knowledge it might offer. We must find this Eye of the universe.

Yarrow
Who’s been computing shuttle trajectories to the Sun Station? Don’t worry; the station is in such a low stellar orbit, we’ve constructed a different, safer way to travel there from Ash Twin.
Idaea
IDAEA: That would be Pye. I told her we wouldn’t be traveling there by shuttle, and that the Sun Station doesn’t even have a landing pad, but she said she knew.
Pye
PYE: It’s a purely theoretical exercise on my part, Yarrow. Who doesn’t love computing a good low stellar orbit shuttle trajectory!
Idaea
IDAEA: Pye, I look forward to working with you, but I’m also relieved it will be easy to return to Ash Twin regularly.
Melorae
MELORAE: This rock is very familiar! Did you travel here, my sedimentary friend? Because your unique color and texture appears identical to a rock I met earlier.
MELORAE: Wasn’t this same rock fragment in the cave we found at the bottom of the dry lakebed (at the north pole)?
Coleus
COLEUS: An update: Melorae and I went back to the Lakebed Cave and observed this rock again. Sometimes it’s there, and sometimes it isn’t.
Melorae
MELORAE: That means this rock wanders like the Quantum Moon does. How curious!
Coleus
COLEUS: We plan to reexamine the northern Lakebed Cave. (Maybe our friendly rock will meet us down there!)

Unknown Nomai
We offer our congratulations! You’ve learned the rule of quantum imaging. Take this knowledge with you on the remainder of your quantum pilgrimage.
Remember, the other quantum shards have other lessons to teach.
Our curiosity goes with you on your journey. You walk in the footsteps of those who came before you, and your path guides those who will follow later.
Phlox
PHLOX: Yarrow, would you kindly step back so Daz is closest to the statue? When pairing, the statue will choose whoever is in closest proximity.
PHLOX: ...See how its eyes have opened? That tells us the statue has paired with Daz. Now, no matter where he is in this star system, Daz’s statue will record his memories and send them to the Ash Twin Project.
Yarrow
YARROW: This is extraordinary sculpting work, Phlox!
Daz
DAZ: He has outdone himself again, hasn’t he? And now that we have our first successful pairing, we can test my memory storage prototype.
DAZ: Each statue will send a single Nomai’s memories to his or her own storage unit within Ash Twin.
Phlox
PHLOX: Each storage unit will be equipped with a mask, the statue’s counterpart, which will be able to send those stored memories back to the corresponding Nomai.

Solanum
SOLANUM: There is fundamental uncertainty throughout the universe. Normally, this uncertainty is only observable on a very small scale. As one approaches the Eye, however, that uncertainty grows enormously.
SOLANUM: The Quantum Moon probably exhibits macroscopic quantum behavior because of its proximity to the Eye. Shards that broke off from the Quantum Moon have a similar effect, as I imagine you’ve seen elsewhere in this star system.
SOLANUM: Conscious observation forces a quantum object to collapse to a single possibility. But what would happen if a conscious observer somehow entered the Eye itself?
SOLANUM: Over time, this has become my clan’s greatest question.
SOLANUM: I imagine your purpose here is the same as mine: to learn about and to find the Eye of the universe.
SOLANUM: I’m unsure how you arrived here, however. Perhaps you came from another star system, as my clan originally did?
SOLANUM: Have you encountered a quantum shard on another planet? The shards look the same as the Quantum Moon’s surface does now, while at the Eye.
SOLANUM: From this, we can reasonably infer the Quantum Moon’s natural state is as we see it now, and that the Eye is its primary location.
SOLANUM: Given the Quantum Moon is the Eye’s moon, it’s likely that any characteristics the moon exhibits are also exhibited by the Eye itself. The Quantum Moon and its shards, for instance, are quantum; thus, the Eye is likely also quantum.
SOLANUM: In fact, this moon is probably quantum because its proximity to the Eye made it quantum, the same way the areas surrounding quantum shards that landed on other planets eventually became quantum, too.
SOLANUM: I am on my first pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon. All Nomai in my clan make this journey when we come of age.
SOLANUM: Even though the Eye cannot be reached from here, the Quantum Moon remains special to us, as it carries us nearer to the Eye than any other place we know.
SOLANUM: I’ve journeyed here to be close to the Eye. While the Eye is obscured from our sight, we can see the Quantum Moon’s reflection of the Eye in the sky above us.
SOLANUM: Suppose you could reach the Eye of the universe: Would you try to enter it?
SOLANUM: What do you imagine the effects of a conscious observer might be?
SOLANUM: I imagine you’ve noticed the Quantum Moon changes in appearance depending on which location it is currently orbiting (for instance, the moon looks quite different when orbiting Giant's Deep than it does when orbiting the Hourglass Twins).
SOLANUM: Because the Quantum Moon clearly changes in its different forms, the Eye (being this moon’s primary location) must be similarly malleable.
SOLANUM: From this, we can hypothesize that the Eye represents extreme changeability.
SOLANUM: That said, despite its malleable nature, the Quantum Moon becomes locked to one specific version of itself when it is consciously observed.
SOLANUM: But what would happen if a conscious observer were to enter the Eye?
SOLANUM: Many in my clan have believed the Eye called to us for a particular purpose.
SOLANUM: When I was a child, I used to believe the Eye was malevolent, to have lured my clan to this star system only to then vanish from them so completely.
SOLANUM: But I don’t fear the Eye, anymore. In fact, it became my fondest hope to see the Eye itself, someday, but I fear this may be beyond my reach.
SOLANUM: You may think I’m strange, but I have a hypothesis that I may not be entirely alive. Perhaps my journey has reached its end.
SOLANUM: These are the two tenets of Nomai philosophy; to seek out and to understand is our way of living.
SOLANUM: We are orbiting the Eye of the universe now, although we cannot see it (only the Quantum Moon’s reflection of it). The Eye is older than the universe itself, and my clan believes it dwells in an extremely distant orbit around this star system.
SOLANUM: I’ve never met one of your kind before. It’s an honor to speak with you! I particularly admire your four eyes.
SOLANUM: There are many questions I would ask, if I could comprehend your language. You have my gratitude for understanding mine.
SOLANUM: This is the Quantum Moon, where we both are standing.
SOLANUM: Despite also orbiting other celestial bodies, the Quantum Moon is the Eye of the universe’s moon.
SOLANUM: I am Solanum, a Nomai. My clan arrived in this star system before my birth, and we now call it home.
SOLANUM: Is this your first time on the Quantum Moon? It’s my first time here.
SOLANUM: If you’ve come here looking for answers, I hope you find them.
SOLANUM: Like many of my clan before me, I journeyed here to see the Quantum Moon’s reflection of the Eye. This is the closest any of us have come to seeing the Eye itself.
SOLANUM: We do not have much connection, you and I.
SOLANUM: Still, this encounter feels special. I hope you won’t mind if I think of you as a friend.
Ramie
RAMIE: I’ve installed the masks inside the Ash Twin Project, Phlox. They look beautiful (although I do feel as though I’m being observed!).
RAMIE: It’s comforting to know the statues will not pair until the project succeeds. Otherwise, I imagine the experience would be hard to endure!
Phlox
PHLOX: Ideally, they’ll only need to activate once the project succeeds; as a safety measure, however, the statues will also activate in the event of equipment failure.
Ramie
RAMIE: They will? Why is that?
Phlox
PHLOX: If anything goes wrong with the Ash Twin Project, the statues (and their masks) will make us aware of the situation and enable us to fix it. Otherwise, it would be possible for us to remain permanently unaware of the problem.
Ramie
RAMIE: I hadn’t thought of that! What a profoundly horrific fate that would be.
Root
ROOT: Friends in the Timber Hearth Mines, the last type of ore you sent us survives the longest in direct heat.
ROOT: Can you send us more of the same for additional testing? We’re attempting to improve its durability, and our forge has already burned through everything you sent!
Oeno
OENO: We’ll deliver more ore to Hollow’s Lantern immediately. You must be fired up about crafting the Ash Twin Project’s protective shell!
Root
ROOT: Yes, the idea of an encasement that’s supernova-proof, however briefly, has kindled my curiosity!
ROOT: My gratitude! I imagine we’ll also have an updated estimate soon of how much ore is needed to seal off the Ash Twin Project.
Oeno
OENO: Will it be more than we initially thought?
Root
ROOT: It will be significantly more. The smallest crack or opening in the protective shell would destroy everything.

Chert
Chert
Goodness, it’s you! Hello! I take it your first launch went well, then? Welcome to the Hourglass Twins. Mind the sand, now.
Me
I have a question for you.
What are you up to?
Chert
Hornfels asked me to update our star charts, so I’m out here observing. This is one of the best places in the solar system to spot astronomical events, you know.
What’s weird is I’ve actually seen a couple of supernovae today. Usually, I’d be fortunate to see just one. Keep an eye or four on the stars, and maybe you’ll spot one yourself!
Tell me, what can I do for you?
Me
I found something!
How do I know if I've spotted a supernova?
What are you doing out here?
Where should I explore here?
How dangerous is that big column of falling sand?
Just saying hi.
Chert
Right now I’m documenting stars. Hornfels noticed our star charts are out of date, so they asked me to update them.
Please don’t tell the others I said this, but sometimes I think I’m the only traveler out here interested in doing any science at all.
...Er, maybe don’t tell Hornfels, either. I think they’re pretty deep in denial.
To be honest, I haven’t left this lakebed. I don’t mean to brag, but I’m really quite good with the Little Scout, so I’ve been taking pictures of everything from right here in my campsite.
Have you seen the old shipwreck site on Ember Twin’s southern hemisphere, the one shooting a bright beam of light into the sky? It’s not one of our own crashes, surprisingly enough - this one’s a Nomai ship.
You’ll find Nomai ruins across the Twins, but, strangely, not a single settlement! Believe me, if there was one to see, I’d have seen it with my Little Scout.
So where did they live? Not on the surface, clearly. Ember Twin is full of cave systems, though - maybe the answer lies underground?
On a scale of one to dead, I’d give it a seven or eight. Awfully pretty, though.
Right now sand is flowing from Ash Twin to Ember Twin, but did you know the process eventually reverses? We're not completely sure why the sand flows back and forth between the Twins, but it seems to be a natural phenomena.
Oh, if you’d like to see something interesting, check out the other Twin once a little more of its sand drains off. I promise you won’t be disappointed.
Supernovae look like extra bright stars to the naked eye, but if you zoom in with your signalscope you can tell that they're actually enormous explosions.
Massive stars go supernova at the very end of their life spans, which is why it's so unusual to see two in a single day.
I wonder if some of these stars are older than we realized?
Watch out for falling sand, okay? I’ve had to dig myself out once or twice, and that’s not half as fun as it sounds.
Hello again!
Please, do tell!
Me
I found out the sun is about to go supernova.
I found your notes about the Attlerock’s main crater.
I found Nomai writing about a hidden planet.
I found Nomai writing about the Quantum Moon.
I found Nomai writing about the Sun Station.
I found modern Nomai transmissions saying the universe is dying.
Actually, nevermind.
Chert
What? What makes you think that?
It’s true the sun has... changed, lately, but I’ve not seen any evidence suggesting the approaching death of our sun! Stars above, no!
I’ll tell you what, though - I’ll keep my eyes on the sun, and if I find any suggestion the its core is collapsing, you shall be the first to know.
I hope that puts your mind at ease.
Did you! I hope they were useful?
The planet I mentioned may have been frozen solid, or just partially made of ice, like a much colder Giant’s Deep - it’s hard to say. It used to be the fifth planet in our solar system.
You’ll notice, of course, that there’s no such planet now. In its place is Dark Bramble, which - how to put this - grew into the space the fifth planet used to occupy.
That is, Dark Bramble quite literally appeared at the center of the fifth planet and began destroying it from the inside-out. Eventually, the planet shattered completely, and its shards were flung across space.
Some of these shards collided with the celestial bodies in our solar system, such as the Attlerock, which I believe is how its biggest crater was formed.
How fascinating! It might interest you to know the existence of an additional planet is entirely plausible, if you look at the physics of our solar system. It would just have to be incredibly far out there - farther than Hearthian ships would be able to travel.
And honestly, we don’t know all that much about what’s out there. The farther you go, the less we know! As such, it’s well within the realm of possibility such a planet exists.
Oh yes, everyone loves a good mystery, don’t they? Who wouldn’t wonder about a moon that’s sometimes there and sometimes not!
I’ve observed the Quantum Moon orbiting each of the five planets, but sometimes, it quite simply disappears from the sky altogether. Maybe there’s another place it travels to!
Unfortunately, if there is, I’ve never seen it. Perhaps if I take a closer look at these star charts...
Is that what’s in orbit around the sun, then, do you think? This... Sun Station?
Quite clever of the Nomai to devise a way to study the sun up close and personal! It must have been tremendously difficult to construct. ...And hot inside. I can only imagine!
I wonder how were they able to travel back and forth from the Sun Station and the Hourglass Twins, when the slightest slip up would have meant a fiery death.
You - what? I don’t... um. What?
You mean to say there are modern Nomai out in other parts of space? And they believe the universe - all of it, the whole thing - is dying? Currently? ...Right now?
If... if that’s true, how could I have missed so many signs? The supernovae were there, but I, but, I’ve been studying the stars for... well, what does it matter if... oh...
I’m very sorry, b-but I have to look over my charts. I h-h-hope you don’t m-mind...
B-b-but surely, I would have seen some kind of other sign than the supernovae, so p-perhaps...?
Nothing you’d like to discuss at the moment? That’s no trouble! If you do discover anything you want to talk about, I’d be happy to help!
Hm? Oh, it’s you! I take it your first launch went well, then? Welcome to the Hourglass Twins. Mind the sand, now.
Hornfels noticed our star charts are out of date, so I came out here to update them. But something seems... how to put this... off.
I’ve seen, what, ten supernovae by now? Twelve? They’re in the double digits now, and that’s, you know, not normal. Not normal at all...
Hm? Oh, you’re back.
Say, have you noticed anything unusual about the stars lately? Something seems... how to put this... off.
I’ve seen, what, ten supernovae already? Twelve? They’re in the double digits now, and that’s, you know, not normal. Not normal at all...
Hello again.
Was there something you needed?
Me
Why are so many stars going supernovae?
Chert
Well, I was - that is, I originally came out here to update our star charts. Now, though, I’m trying to figure out what’s going on with the stars. There are so many - too many supernovae.
Why are so many stars dying out? I’ve never seen anything like this.
Frankly, I’m worried. And a little scared.
To be honest, I haven’t left this lakebed. I don’t mean to brag, but I’m really quite good with the Little Scout, so I’ve been taking pictures of everything from right here in my campsite.
Have you seen the old shipwreck site on Ember Twin’s southern hemisphere, the one shooting a bright beam of light into the sky? It’s not one of our own crashes, surprisingly enough - this one’s a Nomai ship.
You’ll find Nomai ruins across the Twins, but, strangely, not a single settlement! Believe me, if there was one to see, I’d have seen it with my Little Scout.

Oh, if you’d like to see something interesting, check out the other Twin once a little more of its sand drains off. I promise you won’t be disappointed.
I have no idea! Massive stars go supernova when they reach the end of their life spans, so it's possible that the stars are older than we realized. Or maybe our models are wrong and they don't live as long as we expected.
Honestly, I'm not fond of either option! If our charts are wrong, what else is wrong? And our sun...
No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions. I- I'm probably overlooking something. That's it, I just need to collect more data.
Watch out for the stars. I mean, sand.
What? What makes you think that?
It’s true the sun has... changed, lately, but I’ve not seen any evidence suggesting the approaching death of our sun! Stars above, no!
I’ll tell you what, though - I’ll keep my eyes on the sun, and if I find any suggestion the its core is collapsing, you shall be the first to know.

The stars! They're all dying! There’ve been too many supernovae for it to be anything else!
We’re next, do you understand?! Our sun! By Hearth’s name, we’re next!
Please, just... Leave me alone, won’t you?
Me
What do you mean, "we’re next"?
Why are the stars dying?
Chert
It’s the stars, you see. All the other stars are dying out. Oh, why did we have to be born at the end of the universe? And our sun, it...
The star charts! Why? Why did I want to update them so badly? I didn’t have to know, but no, oh no, I had to update the star charts! I had to go looking for things I shouldn’t have! And now our sun is about to... about to... oh...
...I don’t feel well. I’d like to be alone, please.
Why, isn’t that great! Do you know what, I’ve found a few things myself! Most of them have to do with the sun exploding!
Oh, who cares?! What does it matter?! Nothing matters anymore! The sun is about to go supernova! And me, all my research, my life’s work, wasted!
Wasted, you understand?!
The star charts! It’s all the star charts’ fault! I didn’t have to know, but no, oh no, I had to update the star charts! I had to go looking for things I shouldn’t have! And now our sun is about to... about to... oh...
...I don’t feel well. I’d like to be alone, please.
Where should you go? Where can anyone go? Can’t you see it’s too late now?
Oh, who cares?! What does it matter?! Nothing matters anymore! The sun will probably blow up before you can even get there! And me, all my research, my life’s work, wasted!
Wasted, you understand?!
Not as dangerous as what’s about to happen to our entire solar system!
I... I don’t feel well. I’d like to be alone, please. I can’t believe this...
I don't know — they're old! Far older than we realized and now all of them are dying!
What does it matter?! It doesn’t! It doesn’t matter at all! Nothing matters anymore! All my research, my life’s work, wasted!
Wasted, you understand?!
I can’t believe this. I can’t believe this is happening. I can’t... I won’t! I won’t believe it!
Oh, hello...
Come, sit with me, my fellow traveler. Let’s sit together and watch the stars die.
Me
Sure, why not.
If it helps, we’re in a time loop, so we won’t really die.
No, thanks.
Chert
We only get so much time, don’t we? Ah, there was still more I wanted to do...
How unlucky to have been born at the end of the universe.
Ah, that’s a lovely thought. Is that how you’re coping with this?
Does it help?
Perhaps you’re right. ...Yes, we should face this alone. That’s the way.
We enter this world alone, and we leave it alone...
Any minute now...
A time loop, you said? I like that idea...
The stars were beautiful, weren’t they? Even if our star is what ultimately killed us.
I’ll wait here and remember them while you gather everybody.
Shall I begin?
Me
Yes.
Not yet.
Chert
Well, then, here I go!
Take your time! I don’t think there’s anything left to go supernova.
Even if it’s over now, I had a good time learning.
But I think the rules are about to change.

Oh, hey, it’s you!
Ground control didn’t tell me you were launching. Long time no see!
Actually. I guess it’s been a long time since I’ve seen anyone.
Me
Don’t the other travelers come by?
Was that you whistling?
Seems lonely up here.
What is this place?
Marl says hi.
Talk to you later.

Don’t go! Uh, I mean, anything else you wanted to ask?
Me
Don’t the other travelers come by?
Seems lonely up here.
Was that you whistling?
What is this place?
Marl says hi.
Talk to you later.
Esker
The Lunar Outpost saw more traffic back when our ships were less sophisticated and needed more frequent repairs. Nowadays, it’s mostly used to keep a set of eyes on things.
Sometimes Chert comes by to say hi, but Gabbro is Gabbro, and you know how Riebeck feels about “unnecessary spaceflight.”
A little. I’m in touch with ground control – Hornfels and Gossan, mostly – and they radio up to chat now and then.
And when ground control forgets I’m up here and they usually do, I launch my Little Scout at the village.
Me
They forget about you?
You spy on us?
Esker
I don’t blame them. For one, I don’t check in as often as the other travelers, since I’m always in one place.
And it’s not so bad up here, really. At least it’s peaceful and quiet. You don’t always get that in our solar system.
Let alone in our village.
What? No! It’s not spying, it’s...
It’s one-way communication. That none of the villagers know about. Because I’ve never told them.
Probably. Or actually, definitely. The other travelers carry instruments, so they don’t bother whistling.
You can pick up their music with a signalscope, you know. Best spot for that is the north pole. Great reception.
The north pole is marked in red on your mini map, but the Attlerock is a pretty small moon, really. Just go north. You can’t miss it.
Ha ha, very funny. ...Oh, stars above, you’re serious, aren’t you? That’s just depressing.
Sigh...Welcome to the Lunar Outpost, which apparently the space program doesn’t bother to teach anyone anymore.
When we first started Outer Wilds, travelers used to bring their ships here all the time for repairs. Our spacefaring technology has improved loads since then, but the older ships tended to, uh, fall apart a lot. Like, more than they do now.
Using the outpost cut down on the number of launches and landings taking place in the village and also the number of fires. Nowadays, though, it’s mostly just me up here raising saplings from Timber Hearth and keeping an eye on things.
Heh, Marl is probably the only one who remembers I’m up here. I should go see the big lug soon.
Don’t tell them about this, but sometimes I throw my Little Scout down to make sure Marl isn’t doing anything stupid. I worry that big tree in the village wouldn’t stand a chance otherwise.
Hi again. Can’t get enough of the moon? ...I’m kidding.
Do you hear music?
Aren’t you forgetting someone?
I can’t wait to play with the whole group again. Can I start?
Me
Yes.
Not yet.
Esker
Ok, I won’t let you down!
Oh, ok. I’ll– I’ll get to play soon though, right?
Wow... How long has it been since I got to make music with everyone around a campfire?
I’m really happy we’re all here.
Feldspar
Hatchling! You found me!
Nice to have company around a campfire, isn’t it? Go on, go get the others. Wouldn’t want ’em to miss out!
Whaddya say, then — should I get out the ol’ harmonica?
Me
Yes.
Not yet.
Feldspar
Ha ha! Here goes nothing!
You got it hatchling. When you’re ready, just say the word.
You cut it a little close, don’t you think?
Well, it worked out all right in the end, I suppose.
Ahh, I hope there are beasties in the next one.
Journal
Trip 4(?), entry #... I’m gonna say “not 1.”
Crashes: 3
Boring crashes: 0 (a personal best!)
Whoa ho! Never thought I’d see one of these beasties outside of Giant’s Deep! They were awfully useful back there — maybe a jellyfish could be useful here, too?
BLEARGH. This thing tastes terrible! The outside is all rubbery and tough -- maybe that’s because it insulates the jellyfish’s insides from getting zapped by electricity?
Right, I’m going inside of this jellyfish’s interior cavity to see if what’s in there tastes any better.
Note to Feldspar: DO NOT EAT THIS EVEN IF YOU ARE DYING. It would be too sad if this were the last thing you ever ate in this life.
I guess these jellyfish are only useful for insulation from electricity. Again, DO NOT EAT. (Love, Feldspar)
Gabbro
Nice, it’s you. Good to see you made it here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy, isn’t it?
So hey, don’t laugh, but I think I might have had some kind of spiritual experience with a rock shaped like a face.
Me
...What?
Me too!
Gabbro
One of the islands on Giant’s Deep has a Nomai statue on the beach - ever seen one? I brought one back to Timber Hearth with me. Big stone sculpture of a Nomai’s head, three eyes and everything. Beautifully carved, too.
So one minute I’m standing on an island looking at a Nomai sculpture on the beach, and the next thing I know, it’s looking back at me, glowing.
The sculpture replays everything I’ve just done, like it’s been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything’s normal again.
Me
That happened to me at the observatory.
Gabbro
You too, huh?
You’re saying the statue I brought to the museum started glowing at you? Yeah, sounds about right.
One minute I’m standing on an island looking at a Nomai sculpture on the beach, and the next thing I know, it’s looking back at me, glowing.
It replays everything I’ve just done, like it’s been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything’s normal again.
It didn’t seem bad, just... weird? Were we the only ones who saw that happen?
I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them about it, but they told me I must have just nodded off out here and gotten confused.
Then we talked about dreams until Hornfels told me to go refill my oxygen tank before I talked myself to death.
So that’s what’s new with me. But hey, this is your first solo voyage! Let’s talk about you, you know?
Have you ever stared at a cyclone for so long, it started to hypnotize you? I’m telling you, they’ll pull you into a trance if you look at ’em long enough.
Me
I found a photo of you inside the old radio tower.
Gabbro
Well, what are any of us doing here, really?
...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you.
But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.
I mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful.
Here’s something you might like — I saw a bright flash in the sky not too long ago. Something must have happened up there in orbit around the planet.
What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the island where I found the glowing Nomai statue. ...Get it?
I was on the beach on Statue Island when the whole glowy business happened, by the way. It’s a nice beach for that kind of thing. I give it a solid 7 out of 10 on the Gabbro Relaxation Scale.
If you feel like checking out Statue Island, it’s the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch. Well... mostly connected, anyway. You’ll see.
Haha, I know, right?
...Oh, you meant, like, tell you more about it? I gotcha. Well, Giant’s Deep is massive, and mostly water. No surprises there.
There’s a strong current a ways beneath the surface that prevents anything from sinking below it. Seriously, I tried everything I could think of to get past that current, and neither idea worked.
As for land masses, I’ve counted four islands, including this one. There’s also the one with that Nomai statue I saw on the beach.
You’ve seen the cyclones? Yeah, they’re hard to miss. They’ll toss up everything in their path, islands included. Little tip — if you get picked up, try to land in water. Less likely to kill you.
Nice, it’s you. Good to see you made it here in one piece. The first solo launch is a doozy, isn’t it?
So hey, don’t laugh, but I think I might have just, like, died? Somehow?
Do you remember, y’know, dying a few minutes ago? Maybe?
Me
Oh yeah, we definitely died.
I think we’re the only ones who know.
Gabbro
Okay, cool, that’s what I thought. It was all way too vivid to be a dream.
I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them if they had died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical.
Yeah, I tried radioing Hornfels and asking them if they had died, too, but they thought I was being metaphorical or something.
Well, if you remember dying, then I guess I didn’t just fall asleep and have a bad dream or something. I dunno what’s going on, though. Today’s been weird.
Like, I was on a different island earlier, right? I was on the beach looking at one of those big stone statues of a Nomai head, and the next thing I know, it’s looking back at me, glowing.
The statue replays everything I’ve just done, like it’s been watching me through my own eyes, you know? And then suddenly it stops and everything’s normal again.
Me
That happened to me at the observatory.
Gabbro
Come to think of it, when I died, I saw what I’m pretty sure were my memories going backward, just like that time with the statue. Do you think the Nomai statues are related to us dying somehow?
And another thing - we died, but we aren’t dead? That’s pretty unusual for Hearthians.
Well, that’s what’s new with me. But hey, this is your first solo voyage! Let’s talk about you, you know?
Have you ever stared at a cyclone for so long, it started to hypnotize you? I’m telling you, they’ll put you in a trance if you look at ’em long enough.

But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.
I mean, it’s usually quiet and peaceful. Sometimes a cyclone comes by and lifts my little island paradise clean out of the water. Then: less peaceful.
Well actually, after waking up from, you know, dying, I saw the same bright flash in the sky. Something must be happening up there in orbit around the planet.
What else, what else... Have you been to Statue Island? That’s what I’ve been calling it, seeing as it’s the island where I found the glowing Nomai statue. ...Get it?

Okay, here’s a weird one for you — I think I might have just, like, died? Somehow?
I radioed Hornfels at the observatory to ask them about it, but they’re convinced I fell asleep out here and had a nightmare something.
Do you remember, y’know, dying a few minutes ago? Maybe?
Me
Oh yeah, we definitely died.
I think we’re the only ones who know.
Gabbro
Okay, cool, that’s what I thought. It was all way too vivid to be a dream.
I radioed Hornfels again to ask if they had died, too, but I’m pretty sure they thought I was being metaphorical.
Yeah, I radioed Hornfels again to ask if they had died, too, but I’m pretty sure they thought I was being metaphorical.
Well, if you remember dying, then I guess I didn’t just fall asleep and have a weird dream or something. But stars above, what’s going on, then? And then there was that thing with the Nomai statue earlier...
Come to think of it, when I died, I saw what I’m pretty sure were my memories going backward, just like the time with that statue. Do you think the Nomai statues are related to us dying somehow?
So... we died, but we aren’t dead? That’s pretty unusual for Hearthians.
I am going to need to do some serious thinking before I come up with any theories. Maybe I’ll have figured something out by the next time you come by.
Hey again. If you feel like roasting a mallow, feel free to use my campfire. It’s just up the path a little ways.
So what’s up?
Well, what are any of us doing here, really?
...Nah, I’m just kidding. I’m out here exploring our solar system, same as you.
But I tell you what, outer space really gives you room to think. It’s quiet and peaceful out here.

Hey, time pal. So you’re getting the band back together, huh?
Go on, go find the others. I’ll be here. You don’t need me yet, but you will.
What do you say, time buddy? Ready to start the music?
Me
Yes.
Not yet.
Gabbro
Heh, this should be cool.
No rush, I’m not going anywhere.
I tell you what, this has been really fun. And I got to help make something pretty cool, so I’ve got no complaints.
I mean, not me, exactly, but close enough.
It’s the kind of thing that makes you glad you stopped and smelled the pine trees along the way, you know?
Name
Hornfels
Hornfels
There you are! I just finished pre-flight observations, and local conditions are good. Time to get our newest astronaut off the ground!
And you’ll be our first astronaut ever equipped with a Nomai translator tool! I confess, I’ve been giddy all day just thinking about it.
We’re better equipped than ever to unravel the mysteries of the Nomai. You and Hal should be very proud of your work!
Tell me, what’s your plan once you’re in space?
Me
I’m going to learn more about the Nomai.
I’ll meet up with the other travelers.
I want to go somewhere no one’s gone before.
I think I’ll start with something small.
I don’t know.
I’m gonna wing it!
Hornfels
I might have guessed as much! No sense in making a translator tool if you’re not going to use it to translate anything.
We’ve barely scratched the surface of the Nomai writing in our solar system, so we still know very little about them. We’ve no idea if they originated here or traveled here, or why they disappeared.
That tool of yours should prove indispensible in solving the mystery of this ancient species!
You’re going to check in with them, are you? Not a bad plan - no one knows the solar system better than our astronauts.
Let’s see... Chert is on the Hourglass Twins, Riebeck is on Brittle Hollow, and Gabbro is on Giant’s Deep, last I checked.
And... Well, there’s Feldspar, obviously, but of course we don’t know where they are, or if they’re even alive.
Feldspar has been lost for a very long time, I’m afraid.
...On a more cheerful note, you’ll find Esker stationed on the Attlerock. They’re not a traveler so much as a lunar local, but I’m sure they’d appreciate a visit nevertheless.
I like it! You’ll have plenty of options to choose from.
No one’s ever landed on the Interloper before, you know. Perhaps you’ll be the first?
I must say... Should you choose to go to Dark Bramble, be very careful. No one’s explored there before, either, for what you’ll find are excellent reasons.
You’d prefer to ease into things? That’s a sensible plan! More sensible than most of our astronauts tend to be, and that’s a fact.
Do you think you’ll go to the Attlerock, then? Our moon would be a safe place to travel to and get your bearings in space, and I’m sure Esker would appreciate the visit.
Plus, we don’t know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are, or why they were built. You could put your new translator tool through its paces!
Haha! Overwhelmed by the options, perhaps? I don’t blame you.
If you need help getting started, you could go visit Esker on the moon. They’re alone on the Attlerock most of the time, so I’m sure they’d appreciate it.
Plus, we don’t know what the ancient Nomai ruins on the moon are, or why they were built. You could put your new translator tool through its paces!
Planning to follow in the footsteps of Feldspar and the great Outer Wilds Ventures tradition, are you? I might have guessed.
Well, see if you can’t put that translator tool of yours to good use while you’re out there!
Well then, looks like all that’s left is to send you off! All in all, it’s a fine day for a launch!
Me
I’m ready to get off this rock!
I’m ready to die in space.
Hornfels
Excellent! You’ll be needing the launch codes, then.
Here they are. Best get off the ground before Slate makes any more modifications to your ship, eh?
Good luck out there! Let me know if I can help you with anything.
I’m not one for superstition, but isn’t that kind of unlucky to say before a launch?
At any rate, here are the launch codes. Try not to worry too much - our ships are every bit as safe as Slate could be persuaded to make them.
Best of luck out there! Let me know if I can help you with anything.
Hello again!
Back so soon?
Was there something you needed?
Me
I found Feldspar!
The Nomai statue opened its eyes!
Where are the other travelers?
Tell me more about Feldspar.
No thanks, I’m good.
Hornfels
Well, let’s see... Chert is on the Hourglass Twins, Riebeck is on Brittle Hollow, and Gabbro is on Giant’s Deep.
And... there’s Feldspar, obviously, but of course we don’t know where they are, or if they’re even still alive.
Feldspar has been lost for a very long time, I’m afraid.
Feldspar was one of the four founding members of Outer Wilds, along with our flight coach Gossan, Slate the engineer, and me.
As ground control and later the museum curator, I didn’t work with Feldspar as closely as Slate and Gossan did. I can tell you Feldspar was absolutely fearless, though. Nothing scared them.
Test-piloted everything Slate ever built! It’s a wonder Feldspar lived to see space, frankly, but they did. Flew all sorts of dangerous stunts and explored everything they could find.
And then one day, they just... didn’t come back. We don’t know what happened, or where Feldspar went, or even whether they’re still alive.
It’s been a long time since they left.
What? You say the statue opened its eyes and looked at you?!
...How wonderful for you.
No, truly, that’s wonderful! It really is. ...Even if I have been pouring over it every night for weeks. It’s stupendous you were able to get a reaction from the statue just by glancing at it a few times.
Ergh, sorry, that’s not a very scientific thing to say, is it? I am glad. I’m just also insufferably, profoundly jealous. You’ll have to forgive me.
That aside - I have research to do! I wonder why the statue opened its eyes. Surely this means they aren’t mere decorative ornaments...?
You found Feldspar?! And they’re in Dark Bramble?! Stars above, this is wonderful news! Thank you! Thank you for finding them!
That Feldspar didn’t immediately join you on your ship and return here is incredibly Feldspar of them. We were never entirely sure what Feldspar was thinking back then, either.
Still, we ought to fish them out of that dreadful place with all haste! I’ll radio Gossan and have them prepare a ship. It really should be Gossan who brings Feldspar home.
Again, thank you. You can hardly imagine how profoundly happy I am to hear they’re alive and unharmed.
Take care!
Hey, look at this - the statue opened its eyes! Bet you wish you’d seen that happen, huh? Sigh... Me, too.
I’m not even a little closer to understanding what’s going on with this statue.
Notes
Hornfel’s Observations
This is incredible! At first I thought the points of light in this image were stars, but they’re not... they’re galaxies!
And this image covers just a tiny patch of the whole sky, which means the universe contains at least a thousand times more galaxies than we previously imagined.
I... I think I need to sit down.
Hmmm, this is odd. According to my redshift calculations, every single galaxy in this image is moving away from us.
In fact, the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it appears to be moving away.
It’s almost as if the entire universe is expanding.
But if that’s true, was everything closer together in the past? And how far back can we extrapolate? Did the universe have a beginning?

Hm? Oh, hello, astronaut.
This is good weather for your launch, right? That’s lucky!
Me
What are you up to?
Any good sounds from space today?
Moraine
Hello, again.
Me
Haven’t you been up in this tree a while?
Any good sounds from space today?
Moraine
I’m using my signalscope to pick up sounds from distant planets.
It’s set to the Outer Wilds Ventures frequency so I can pick up the travelers’ music.
There are! My signalscope is set to the Outer Wilds Ventures frequency, so I’m listening to the travelers’ music.
Last night I heard Riebeck’s banjo coming from Brittle Hollow. I hope that means they’re safe.
I can hear different planets, too! It depends on what time of day or night it is, since different planets are in the sky at different times.
Signalscopes are cool.
I’m concerned Marl will cut down this tree if there’s no one in it, so I don’t want to leave it for too long.
Mayor Rutile says Marl isn’t supposed to cut it down, but I don’t think they see eyes-to-eyes on this one.
Um, I’ll still watch your launch, though! I’ll have a good view from up here.

Riebeck
It’s, um, it’s not quite time yet.
I’m pretty sure we’ll need the others for this next part. We’ll need, you know... everyone.
No rush! Take your time. It might not even exist here...
Should I begin?
Me
Yes.
Not yet.
Riebeck
You g-got it. I’ll do my best!
Ok, I'll wait until you're ready.
I learned a lot, by the end of everything.
The past is past, now, but that’s... you know, that’s okay! It’s never really gone completely. The future is always built on the past, even if we won't get to see it.
Still, it’s, um, time for something new, now.

Once they arrive, I believe we’ll be ready for the next step.

Is it time to find out?
Me
Yes.
Not yet.
Solanum
This song is new to me, but I am honored to be a part of it.
Then I will wait until you are ready to know the answer.
I believe we’ve reached the end of our journey.
All that remains is to collapse the innumerable possibilites before us.
Are you ready to learn what comes next?
Me
Yes.
Not yet.
Solanum
I admire your curiosity, friend. Let’s find out together.
It’s tempting to linger in this moment, while every possibility still exists.
But unless they are collapsed by an observer, they will never be more than possibilities.
Note
I saw smoke coming from Youngbark Crater up north and figured I should go check it out. You can use the scout launcher, just please don’t break it while I’m gone.

Ship Log
Village
The one and only Hearthian village, as well as the main source of explosions on this planet.
The Nomai statue in the observatory opened its eyes and looked at me! I saw strange glowing lights and my own memories flashed before my eyes.
Hal says the statue has never opened its eyes before (despite Hornfels' best efforts).
Zero-G Cave
I hear Gossan has the zero-g cave set up if I want a refresher before I launch.
A cave at the very center of Timber Hearth used by Outer Wilds Ventures to train new astronauts.
I successfully repaired another "satellite" for Gossan.
Dark Bramble Seed
Harmonica Signal
Esker's signalscope log reports harmonica music coming from somewhere on Timber Hearth. They claim it sounds just like Feldspar's harmonica, but Feldspar disappeared in space ages ago.
A seed from Dark Bramble crashed here and has already taken root. Tektite wants to use a scout launcher to get a look at what's inside.
My signalscope picks up harmonica music when I aim it at the seed.
I launched my Little Scout into the seed. Somehow the seed is much bigger on the inside.
Nomai Mines
The Nomai were mining ore somewhere on Timber Hearth.
The Nomai mined ore from this site to craft a protective shell designed to physically seal off the central chamber inside Ash Twin.
Once the shell was finished, the Nomai checked to ensure there were no longer any physical entrances or cracks.
The Nomai discovered a species of four-eyed, semi-aquatic lifeforms in the waterways near the mine.
Quantum Grove
Quantum Signal
Chert detected a strange signal coming from the crater at Timber Hearth's south pole. It's very similar to the signal emitted by the Quantum Moon.
The Nomai detected a quantum signal coming from somewhere on Timber Hearth.
There is a strange rock shard in this grove that moves when I’m not watching. It emits a signal on the Quantum Fluctuations frequency.
I found a poem written on one of the trees in the grove.
Radio Tower
A radio tower designed to receive photos taken by the deep space satellite. There are several photos of the entire solar system hanging on the walls. Hornfels noticed something strange in one of the photos, but concluded equipment malfunction was the only sensible explanation.
Riebeck’s Camp
Riebeck headed to Brittle Hollow to investigate something the Nomai were doing at the south pole.
Riebeck landed their ship near the big dome at the south pole. The door leading inside was broken, so they decided to head north to the ruins on the equator in search of a way beneath the surface.
Riebeck discovered an old Nomai path near their campsite on the equator. The path starts inside the ruined building with trees growing out of it.
Riebeck reached the Crossroads and continued downward in search of oxygen.
Riebeck has set up camp at the bottom of the Crossroads. Their excitement at being surrounded by so much Nomai history is matched only by their terror of the black hole.
Riebeck is Timber Hearth's only archaeologist. They overcame their fear of space to explore Brittle Hollow's treasure trove of Nomai culture.
Gravity Cannon
A huge cylindrical structure that generates a strong upward gravity field.
I recalled a Nomai shuttle from the Quantum Moon.
Tower of Quantum Knowledge
This tower (located on Brittle Hollow's equator) held useful knowledge for Nomai embarking on their first pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon.
A Nomai named Solanum was told to visit the Tower of Quantum Knowledge (on Brittle Hollow's equator) to learn one final rule before embarking on her pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon.
The Nomai built a shrine on the Quantum Moon to aid in the pilgrimage to its sixth location. "Remember this final rule: To explore the sixth location, the shrine must be on the moon’s north pole."
The pilgrimage to the Quantum Moon was a deeply significant journey for the Nomai.
After the two groups of Nomai stranded on Ember Twin and Brittle Hollow were reunited, it became their united goal to find and visit the Quantum Moon.
Quantum Shard
The Nomai noticed a strange rock shard that appeared to wander when no one was watching.
A strange rock shard that wanders when no one is watching. The Nomai determined this shard is the reason objects in this grove behave in a quantum manner.
The Nomai hypothesized that this shard is actually a piece of the Quantum Moon.
This shard emits the same signal as the Quantum Moon.
Northern Glacier
The north pole of Brittle Hollow is covered in snow and ice. There is a uniquely shaped Nomai ruin on the surface.
The Nomai were able to warp here from the White Hole Station. This is where they first recreated warp technology.
Escape Pod 1
One of the three Nomai escape pods landed somewhere on Brittle Hollow.
One of three Nomai escape pods that crashed in our solar system.
All three escape pods were launched from something called the Vessel, which was badly damaged.
Old Settlement
Shelter Site
The Nomai survivors who crashed on Brittle Hollow climbed down the cliff to a shelter site below the surface.
The Nomai constructed a temporary settlement beneath their crashed escape pod.
The Nomai worked together to recall an eye-shaped signal they encountered while aboard the Vessel.
The signal was somehow older than the universe itself. The Nomai decided to call it the "Eye of the universe."
The Nomai abandoned this settlement over growing concerns about its stability.
Mural (Panel 3)
A mural of three escape pods evacuating the Nomai vessel.
Mural (Panel 2)
A mural of Dark Bramble ensnaring the Nomai vessel.
Mural (Panel 1)
A mural of a Nomai vessel encountering a signal.
The Hanging City
Northern Settlement
The Nomai decided to migrate from the Old Settlement to the northern glacier. They used gravity crystals to craft a stable path beneath the surface.
There's a huge Nomai city just to the north of Riebeck's campsite.
A Nomai city suspended beneath Brittle Hollow's northern glacier. The city is divided vertically into four districts.
I found a switch in the Meltwater District that raises and lowers the Black Hole Forge.
The Nomai debated how to obtain the powerful, highly advanced warp core required for the Ash Twin Project.
The Nomai traveled to this solar system in pursuit of a signal from something older than the universe itself. They named the source of this signal the "Eye of the universe."
Black Hole Forge
The Black Hole Forge is suspended below the Hanging City. I found a switch in the Meltwater District that raises and lowers the forge.
The Black Hole Forge District is the highest district in the Hanging City.
A Nomai named Poke planned to create a new advanced warp core in the Black Hole Forge.
The Nomai crafted warp cores at the Black Hole Forge before delivering them to Ash Twin.
A warp tower's alignment point is not its warp receiver. Rather, a warp tower always aligns with the center of its corresponding astral body.
The warp receiver must be located on (or in close orbit around) the relevant astral body.
The Hourglass Twins are so close together they function as a single astral body, with a shared alignment point in between them.
All of the warp towers were being constructed on Ash Twin, while the six warp receivers were being constructed at different locations.
A Nomai named Poke successfully forged an advanced warp core for the Ash Twin Project.
Alignment Angle Diagram
A diagram depicting the alignment angle between a warp tower and its corresponding astral body.
Warp tower alignment angles are not exact. They only need to be within five degrees of the astral body's center.
This results in slightly longer warp windows that last roughly several seconds.
Anyone stepping onto the warp platform during the active window will be immediately warped.
Southern Observatory
The Nomai decided to build a larger, more sophisticated Eye signal locator on Brittle Hollow's south pole.
There are two paths beneath Brittle Hollow's surface that lead to the observatory. One starts at the gravity cannon, and the other starts at the Tower of Quantum Knowledge.
Riebeck says you can't get into the observatory from the surface (they tried), but there's probably a path to it beneath the crust somewhere.
There's a door to the observatory on the surface, but it's broken.
The new, more sensitive locator the Nomai built in this observatory was unable to detect any trace of the Eye's signal.
Based on their knowledge of the Quantum Moon, the Nomai believed the Eye was in a distant orbit around the sun.
The Nomai decided to stop searching for the Eye's signal and instead look for it visually by sending out a deep space probe.
There were concerns that the probability of launching a probe in the correct direction would be absurdly small.
Tornado Simulation
Ocean Current Discovery
The Nomai at the Southern Observatory constructed a model of Giant's Deep that revealed how an object might sink below the strong ocean current.
Most cyclones on Giant's Deep rotate clockwise. These are the cyclones the Nomai used to send components into orbit.
There also exists a rarer type of cyclone that spins the opposite direction and pushes objects beneath the waters and below the current.
Feldspar’s Camp
Feldspar headed off to Dark Bramble after reaching the core of Giant's Deep.
Inside the Seed
When I launch my scout into the seed that crashed on Timber Hearth, it ends up in a much bigger space filled with fog and thorny vines.
Feldspar is alive! They crashed their ship and is now camping inside a huge anglerfish skeleton.
Feldspar doesn't think my scout tracker is wrong when it says my scout is in two places at once. They have a theory that space doesn’t work the same inside Dark Bramble.
Feldspar doesn't sound overly eager to return to civilization. They've been enjoying the (relative) peace and quiet.
Frozen Jellyfish
Hollow Vine
Feldspar hinted that a secret to reaching the core of Giant's Deep lies at the end of the hollow vine they crashed their ship into. To find Feldspar's ship, I'll want to go to the tail end of the anglerfish skeleton and look for a flickering light in the fog.
Feldspar documented their attempts to eat this enormous jellyfish frozen in the ice. The outside was all rubbery and tough, possibly because it insulates the jellyfish’s insides from getting zapped by electricity.
Feldspar decided to venture into the jellyfish’s interior cavity to see if it tasted any better on the inside.
After tasting the inside of the jellyfish, Feldspar concluded that these jellyfish are only useful for insulation from electricity.
Escape Pod 3
One of the three Nomai escape pods never made it out of Dark Bramble.
One of three Nomai escape pods that crashed in our solar system.
All three escape pods were launched from something called the Vessel, which was badly damaged.
The survivors from Escape Pod 3 detected two distinct beacons from the Vessel, as if it was in two locations at once.
Nomai Grave
Escape Pod 3 Survivors
The survivors from Escape Pod 3 abandoned the wreckage and attempted to return to the Vessel.
The survivors decided to follow the closer of the two Vessel beacons due to their limited air supply. They planned to leave a trail of lights behind them in case someone heard their distress signal.
The survivors from Escape Pod 3 followed one of the two Vessel beacons to a small Dark Bramble seed, where they could go no further.
The Nomai could faintly hear the Vessel's beacon from within the seed, but the opening was too small for a single Nomai to fit through, much less an escape pod.
The Vessel's beacon was dying, and would soon be gone completely.
If I launch my scout into the seed, I can take photos of an enormous derelict Nomai ship.
The Vessel
The Nomai warped to this solar system in a spaceship called the Vessel. They were attempting to follow a signal from the Eye of the universe.
The Vessel crashed somewhere in Dark Bramble.
The Vessel's warp core broke when the ship crashed in Dark Bramble.
I launched my scout into the seed at the Nomai Grave and took photos of an enormous derelict Nomai ship.
I found the derelict Nomai Vessel deep within Dark Bramble.
The Vessel's warp core is long dead.
I activated a three-sided pillar on the Vessel's bridge that appears to be some sort of input device.
The Nomai tried to call for help, but the Vessel's outgoing message system broke during the crash.
The Vessel can still hear incoming messages from other Nomai vessels. The remaining Nomai clans are regrouping in response to the impending death of the universe.
I found a recording of the original signal the Nomai encountered from the Eye of the universe. The Nomai were worried the signal might disappear, so they warped before they could tell another clan where they were going.
Orbital Probe Cannon
The Nomai finished building the final module for the Orbital Probe Cannon and sent it into orbit around Giant’s Deep.
I used a Nomai projection pool and saw the interior of a space station in orbit around Giant's Deep.
The Nomai decided to construct a probe cannon in orbit around Giant’s Deep.
Orbital Flash
Gabbro sees a bright flash in the sky at the start of every loop. Something must be happening in orbit around Giant’s Deep.
The broken remains of a Nomai space station in orbit around Giant's Deep. There are three accessways branching off from the central hub area.
The Orbital Probe Cannon was created to find the precise location of the Eye of the universe.
The Nomai pushed the Orbital Probe Cannon above its maximum power setting to create the greatest chance of finding the Eye of the universe.
One of the Orbital Probe Cannon’s three modules.
The Probe Tracking Module is receiving data from the launched probe.
Any Nomai aboard the Probe Tracking Module would be the first to see the coordinates of the Eye of the universe.
A Nomai computer reports the Probe Tracking Module as "missing."
I saw the Probe Tracking Module through a Nomai projection pool. It looks like the module is underwater. I could see purple electricity outside the viewport.
The Orbital Probe Cannon has launched millions of probes.
The 9,318,054th probe located a deep space anomaly matching all known criteria for the Eye of the universe.
The statue in the Probe Tracking Module automatically records each probe's trajectory and transmits the data to the Ash Twin Project.
I found Nomai coordinates marking the location of the Eye of the universe.
One of the Orbital Probe Cannon’s three modules.
The Launch Module looks heavily damaged. There’s a huge breach in the glass viewport.
The Launch Module's viewport window is fractured, exposing it to the vacuum of space.
The Launch Module is badly damaged, but its projection pool is still intact.
A Nomai named Mallow argued that it wouldn't matter if the cannon's structural integrity was compromised, since they only needed to fire the probe once.
A Nomai named Privet countered that they wouldn't be capable of receiving the probe's data if the Probe Tracking Module was destroyed.
One of the Orbital Probe Cannon’s three modules.
The Control Module (recently) received a request from the Ash Twin Project to launch the probe. The cannon was aligned with a randomly selected probe trajectory.
The probe was successfully launched, but the cannon's structural integrity was compromised in the process. Damage is detected in multiple modules.

A laboratory with three test chambers. The second chamber is badly damaged and can be entered through a hull breach in the side of the Stranger.
I saw a vision-like recording of someone picking up an artifact and going to sleep in front of a green fire. The rest of the vision was distorted and difficult to make out, but a flame seemed to appear inside the artifact.
I found a slide reel that shows three experiments conducted with three different artifacts. The third experiment appears to have been a success.
Abandoned Temple
Cliffside Building
I saw a building marked with a unique symbol recessed into one of the canyon walls, but the bridge that used to lead to it has rotted away.
An abandoned temple marked with the symbol of a burning slide reel. It can be accessed from a passage in the Hidden Gorge.
There is an interface upstairs that can be used to line up symbols in a vertical sequence.
Entering the correct sequence opens the path to a secret room beneath the temple.
I found a slide reel that shows the Stranger's inhabitants removing all of the slide reels from their shelves, scanning each reel with a device, and incinerating specific slides as well as entire reels.

I found a diagram of a hollow metal structure suspended by chains. There is a round hole underneath that appears to be the only entrance.
A large metal structure suspended by chains. It can be entered by swimming from below.
There is a sealed vault illuminated by a green fire inside the structure.
Subterranean Lake
I discovered a vast subterranean lake beneath the submerged structure. The sealed vault is resting on the shore of the lake. There are three interfaces, each marked with one of the three symbols from the vault.
I rotated the mechanism in front of the vault, causing it to strain against the chains holding it shut. Moments later rays of green light spilled out of the vault.
Sealed Vault
I found a strange vault wrapped in chains and marked with three glowing symbols.
A slide reel from the River Lowlands showed a strange vault being closed and sealed with chains and a glowing symbol.
A slide reel from the Cinder Isles showed a glowing symbol and chains appear around a strange vault.

Chert’s Camp
Chert has set up their astronomy gear on the north pole of Ember Twin.
Chert has spotted an unusually high number of supernovae recently.
All of the stars in the universe are dying, including our sun.
The stars are simply dying from old age. Apparently they're much older than we realized.
Chert has become catatonic in response to our sun's imminent death.
Quantum Moon Locator
A Nomai device created to track the Quantum Moon's location.
The Nomai hypothesized that the Quantum Moon might be a form of macroscopic quantum mechanics.
The Quantum Moon travels to a total of five locations.
The Nomai shuttle that's frozen on the Interloper can be called home to the gravity cannon on Ember Twin.
I recalled a Nomai shuttle from the Interloper.
Escape Pod 2
Escape Pod
One of the three Nomai escape pods landed somewhere on the Hourglass Twins.
Nomai Shipwreck
Chert saw a Nomai shipwreck shooting a beam of light into the sky somewhere on Ember Twin's southern hemisphere.
One of three Nomai escape pods that crashed in our solar system.
All three escape pods were launched from something called the Vessel, which was badly damaged.
High Energy Lab
The negative time interval measured at the White Hole Station was further investigated at the High Energy Lab (in the canyon at Ember Twin’s equator).
The Ash Twin Project was planned at the High Energy Lab, a building with large solar panels on Ember Twin’s equator.
The High Energy Lab can only be accessed by a path from the Sunless City.
The Nomai successfully reproduced the temporal anomaly first observed at the White Hole Station (warped objects appear to arrive before they depart).
The Nomai discovered they could increase the negative time interval between arrival and departure by adding energy to the warp cores.
The Nomai wanted to know if a 22-minute negative time interval was possible. They concluded it would require new technology to produce the necessary energy as well as an advanced warp core to handle those energies. Ash Twin was proposed as a location for the project.
Ash Twin Tower Designs
There are tower designs in the High Energy Lab that reveal each warp receiver's location.
Designs for each of the towers on Ash Twin's equator.
Each tower warps to a different planet (although many Nomai were quick to note that the sun is not actually a planet).
Each tower was designed to visually reflect its warp destination.
The towers allowed the Nomai to quickly travel between Ash Twin and all other locations crucial to the Ash Twin Project.
The Sunless City
The Nomai survivors who crashed on Ember Twin decided to seek shelter in the caves beneath their crashed escape pod.
The Nomai discovered a promising long-term shelter site at the end of one of the passages beneath the escape pod.
Underground Settlement
Chert thinks the lack of surface ruins means the Nomai must have lived somewhere underground.
There is a path leading to the High Energy Lab from the Sunless City.
I found a trailmarker for the the Sunless City, but the path is blocked.
A Nomai city built into the walls of a huge underground cavern. The city is divided vertically into four districts.
The Nomai debated building a Sun Station in order to power the Ash Twin Project. Several Nomai opposed its construction, arguing that failure could result in the destruction of the solar system.
The Nomai traveled to this solar system in pursuit of a signal from something older than the universe itself. They named the source of this signal the "Eye of the universe."
Anglerfish Fossil
I found a cave with an anglerfish fossil inside, but the opening is only big enough for my scout.
The Nomai learned how to evade anglerfish (theoretically, at least) by studying an anglerfish fossil they found on Ember Twin.
Fossil Fish Cave
Nomai children used to play a game in Fossil Fish Cave. There is a way to enter Fossil Fish Cave from Stepping Stone Cave.
The entrance from Stepping Stone Cave is hard to see unless the anglerfish is fed a light first.
Nomai children used to play a game here. One player was the anglerfish and wore a blindfold. The rest of the children (the littlefish) lined up against one wall. When the anglerfish said go, the littlefish had to sneak across to the other side.
The blindfold rule was added because real anglerfish are blind.
The adult Nomai were delighted to see the children incorporate their research into the game's rules.
Quantum Caves
The Nomai detected a quantum signal coming from somewhere on the Hourglass Twins.
The Nomai noticed a strange wandering rock that appeared in multiple caves on Ember Twin’s northern hemisphere.
I found a strange rock shard that moves when I’m not watching. It emits a signal on the Quantum Fluctuations frequency.
Lakebed Cave
The wandering rock was first spotted in a cave at the bottom of the dry lakebed at Ember Twin’s north pole.
A Nomai named Coleus mysteriously vanished from a cave at the bottom of the dry lakebed at Ember Twin’s north pole.
A Nomai named Coleus was standing on the wandering rock when another Nomai's lantern died. When they relit the lantern, Coleus and the rock were both gone.
To travel with a quantum object, I must stand on the object and cease to observe my surroundings (meaning I must be in complete darkness). Coleus used this quantum rule to escape the cave he was trapped in.
Coleus and Melorae returned to examine the rock. They theorized that when a conscious being is in contact with a quantum object and ceases to observe his or her surroundings, the being can become entangled with that quantum object, and they both move together.
Frozen Nomai Shuttle
I found a Nomai shuttle almost completely encased in ice.
The Nomai landed on the Interloper not long after its arrival in the solar system. The shuttle's equipment heard strange energy readings coming from somewhere beneath the surface.
There were three Nomai aboard the shuttle. One of them stayed behind to keep the shuttle warm while the other two explored the Interloper.
Clary, the Nomai who stayed behind, lost contact with the other two after they descended below the Interloper's surface.
Ruptured Core
Subsurface Energy Readings
The shuttle's equipment heard strange energy readings coming from somewhere beneath the surface.
Two of the Nomai located a fissure in the ice on the Interloper’s sunward side. They descended inside to investigate.
I found the two missing members of the Nomai shuttle crew near a large ruptured stone that looks like it exploded from the inside.
The Nomai traced the strange energy readings to a spherical stone casing filled with some form of exotic matter.
They determined the exotic matter was both lethal and under extreme pressure. If the stone were to rupture, the exotic matter within would rapidly expand, completely blanketing the solar system almost instantaneously.
One of the Nomai stayed behind to examine the alien matter while the other rushed back to the surface to warn the rest of the Nomai.
Ocean Depths
Gabbro says there’s a strong current beneath the surface of the ocean that prevents anything from sinking below it.
The Nomai on the Construction Yard saw something sink beneath the underwater current, which they'd previously thought was impossible.
Feldspar found a way to reach the core of Giant’s Deep.
The ocean is surprisingly calm beneath the current. Some sort of electrical field surrounds the planet's core.
I passed through the electric barrier and reached the coral forest at the planet's core.
Gabbro’s Island
Hal says Gabbro went back to Giant’s Deep to try to learn more about the Nomai statue in the observatory.
Gabbro is lounging in a hammock near the island’s shore.
Gabbro found a Nomai statue on another island. The statue's eyes started glowing and Gabbro saw their memories flash before their eyes.
Gabbro remembers dying. They saw their memories flash before their eyes, just like the time with the statue.
Gabbro and I seem to be the only ones aware that we're in a time loop.
Construction Yard
The Nomai built the Orbital Probe Cannon at a Construction Yard on Giant’s Deep.
This island is where the Nomai built the Orbital Probe Cannon.
For some reason, the Nomai put the Orbital Probe Cannon on indefinite hiatus. The cannon was not asked to fire.
According to a Nomai computer, a long-range probe was recently launched from the Orbital Probe Cannon.
Bramble Island
An island of thorny vines and what appears to be a frozen jellyfish. It looks like Feldspar camped here before heading off to Dark Bramble.
Statue Island
One of the islands on Giant’s Deep has a Nomai statue on the beach just like the one Gabbro brought back to Timber Hearth.
Statue Island (as Gabbro calls it) is the one with two islands connected by a natural rock arch.
This island must be where the Nomai created statues like the one in our observatory.
I found a Nomai statue lying on the beach. It looks just like the one in our observatory.
Statue Workshop
I found a sign for a "Statue Workshop" next to a broken door that used to lead inside the island.
Some Nomai children debated bypassing the Statue Workshop's door and sneaking inside via an alternate (more dangerous) route.
Island Interior
I can see into a large cave from one of the ruins on top of the island. The bottom of the cave is filled with water.
Nomai statues were designed to pair with a single user, record their memories, and send those memories to a storage unit within the Ash Twin Project.
Each storage unit inside the Ash Twin Project was equipped with a mask (the statue’s counterpart), which could then send those stored memories back to the corresponding user.
The statues were designed to only activate once the Ash Twin Project succeeded, or in the event that it failed.
Tower of Quantum Trials
The Nomai detected a Quantum signal coming from somewhere on Giant’s Deep.
This tower held knowledge a Nomai needed to make his or her first quantum journey.
"Observing a quantum object; observing an image of a quantum object. These are the same."
The Nomai called this the "Rule of Quantum Imaging."
"Remember, the other quantum shards have other lessons to teach."
Quantum Moon
The Nomai on Brittle Hollow observed a phantom moon that would sometimes appear in the sky.
The Nomai on Ember Twin observed a moon that would disappear when no one was watching.
A Nomai named Solanum landed a shuttle on the Quantum Moon.
Chert’s research notes mention a Quantum Moon that no Hearthian has been able to land on.
I was able to land on the surface of the Quantum Moon.
I found a dead Nomai in a space suit near the south pole.
Solanum's Shuttle
A Nomai named Solanum landed her shuttle at the Quantum Moon's south pole and prepared to make the rest of the journey on foot.
Visitors to the Quantum Moon always arrive at the south pole (for reasons unknown to the Nomai).
Quantum Shrine
The Nomai built a shrine on the Quantum Moon to aid in the pilgrimage to its sixth location.
A Nomai shrine that wanders about the Quantum Moon.
"You have recalled the rule of quantum imaging" is inscribed next to a mural of a tower on an island.
"Recall the rule of quantum entanglement" is inscribed next to a mural of a quantum shard in a cave.
"Recall the rule of the sixth location" is inscribed next to a mural of a tower hanging above a black hole.
Sixth Location
The Quantum Moon sometimes disappears, possibly to an unknown sixth location.
Many Nomai went on a pilgrimage during which the Quantum Moon carried them to its sixth and most secret location.
To explore the sixth location, the shrine on the Quantum Moon must be on the moon’s north pole.
I met a living Nomai named Solanum at the south pole!
The Quantum Moon is the Eye of the universe's moon.
At this location, the Quantum Moon becomes a reflection of the Eye itself.
The Eye is likely the source of all macroscopic quantum phenomena in the solar system.
Solanum wonders what would happen if a concious observer were to enter the Eye.
Solanum has a hypothesis that she may not be entirely alive.
Sun Station
There is a way to safely travel to the Sun Station from Ash Twin.
The Nomai debated building a Sun Station in order to power the Ash Twin Project.
The Nomai built something called the Sun Station, but not everyone supported its construction.
The Sun Station was designed to make the sun go supernova.
The Nomai fired the Sun Station but it had no effect on the sun. They concluded that the Sun Station could never cause the sun to go supernova.
After the failure of the Sun Station, the Nomai took a break to investigate the newly arrived comet.
According to a Nomai computer, our sun has reached the end of its natural life cycle.
Esker’s Camp
Sounds like Esker is still stationed on the Attlerock. They’ve been there by themself for a while.
Esker is growing a crop of trees at their camp. They seemed to be doing ok, but they’ve probably been alone on the moon for too long.
Lunar Lookout
Esker says the Attlerock’s north pole (marked in red on my minimap) is a great spot to listen for the other travelers’ music with a signalscope.
A lookout platform with a spectacular view of the solar system. Esker uses their signalscope here to keep tabs on the other travelers.
Eye Signal Locator
Lunar Ruins
I hear there are Nomai ruins somewhere on the Attlerock. No one knows what they are or why they were built.
The Nomai text in the observatory talks about calibrating some sort of device on the Attlerock.
A Nomai device created to pinpoint the sources of distant signals.
The Nomai were disappointed by their failure to detect a signal from something called the Eye of the universe.
Ash Twin Towers
Several large Nomai towers form a ring around Ash Twin's equator.
The White Hole Station was used as a model for these towers, which were built for the Ash Twin Project.
Ash Twin Project
The central chamber inside Ash Twin was physically sealed off by an immensely thick protective shell.
The Nomai planned to construct technology capable of producing a 22-minute negative time interval on Ash Twin.
Every memory recorded by a Nomai statue is transmitted to a corresponding storage unit within Ash Twin.
An advanced warp core was approved for installation in the central chamber of Ash Twin.
A hollowed-out chamber inside Ash Twin. The energy cables from the surface are plugged into a protective casing at the center of the planet.
There are eight monoliths with Nomai masks attached. Three of the masks are actively receiving data from the Probe Tracking Module, Giant's Deep, and Timber Hearth respectively.
The Ash Twin Project was designed to use the energy from a supernova (triggered by the Sun Station) to send probe data from the Orbital Probe Cannon 22 minutes into the past.
The Sun Station did not work. Although the Ash Twin Project was theoretically sound, the Nomai were unable to power it.
There is an advanced warp core inside the protective casing at the center of the planet. Removing the core will disable the Ash Twin Project.
Volcanic Testing Site
Ore samples from the Nomai Mines on Timber Hearth were sent to this volcano for durability testing.
The Nomai were trying to craft a (briefly) supernova-proof shell to encase the Ash Twin Project.
Even the smallest crack or opening in the protective shell would destroy everything.
White Hole Station
There is a White Hole Station on the other side of Brittle Hollow's black hole.
Several Nomai returned to the station to investigate an equipment reading that appeared to violate causality.
The experiments at the High Energy Lab were based on extraordinary findings from the White Hole Station.
The towers on Ash Twin were modeled after the White Hole Station.
Every Nomai warp tower is tuned to a specific astral body.
To use a tower, you must be standing on the warp platform during the tower's alignment with its corresponding astral body (the alignment happens when the astral body is directly overhead).
The Nomai noticed something strange: Warped objects appeared to arrive at the receiver on Brittle Hollow slightly before they departed the White Hole Station.
This negative time interval between an object arriving and departing was incredibly miniscule (roughly one hundred-thousandth of a second). The Nomai were skeptical if their equipment could even measure time to such a small degree.
